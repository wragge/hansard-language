    <p>For example, the study of the geology of the sea floor; the potential of the sea as a source of food and pharmacological products; the need for and means of conserving our marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>; the effect upon that <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the activities of man, in his attempts to win new treasures from the sea and of predators, among which I would anticipate that the Crown of Thorns starfish would be a continuing subject of study until the problems it has created may have been solved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is that the words Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> be deleted from the motion with a view to inserting the amendment moved by  Senator Little? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the lengthy deadlock between the Department of National Development and the Department of the Interior over proclamation of the Northern Territory Top End National Park, will the Minister for National Development offer himself to the social <span class="highlight">environment</span> committee for questioning and so allay the fears of many conservationists that he has become unwittingly a lackey of the big mining interests in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710520_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, been drawn to a article appearing in this morning’s ‘Canberra Times’ in which the Goodradigbee Shire Council health surveyor,  Mr K.

    <p>That there be referred to the Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts the position of and provision for deprived schools - a deprived school being a school in the inner urban or rural areas providing primary education, in which a high proportion of the school population is disadvantaged through background and/or <span class="highlight">environment</span> - with a view to financial aid to the States to premit the recognition of such schools as special schools warranting a more liberal scale in staffing, equipping and servicing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the continued silence of the Minister for the Interior in the face of fierce agitation by the Postmaster-General’s Department for the construction of a communications tower on Black Mountain, I ask: Will he give an assurance that if a request emanates from a group of Canberra citizens for an investigation of the proposal by the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> he will defer making any ministerial decision until such an inquiry takes place? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts been drawn to legislation being introduced in the Victorian Parliament by which penalties for air pollution in that State will be drastically increased as a result of a maximum penalty of $5,000 being imposed for the contravention of any of the provisions of the Clean Air Act and a maximum penalty of $2,000 being imposed for each day the offence continues after conviction or an order by a court? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst recognising that the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts is a newly established Department and obviously some reasonable lime is necessary to obtain full efficiency, the Committee, in its examination of the Estimates of the Department, found that there was a considerable degree of confusion, lack of information and slow progress in reaching establishment in certain areas, particularly the section dealing with the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An environmental inquiry is to be conducted for the purpose of ascertaining how someone could go ahead with a project in relation to which there is much opposition without taking into consideration the impact that it may have on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and for the purpose of ascertaining how the Lake Pedder project came about despite the great public outcry against it, as well as to ensure that any mistakes which may have been made in the decision to go ahead with the Lake Pedder project will not occur with respect to similar projects in other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as the proceedings this evening are concerned, I think it is upon the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  to indicate now what he proposes to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the statement of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  that he is unable to give me those figures this evening and owing to the lateness of the hour, perhaps the Committee should deal with the four other departments in Group A still to be considered and tomorrow the Minister might have the answers to the questions I have asked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would permit the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> then to supply the answers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has suggested that the Committee should pass on to the consideration of Group B. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> to tell us when we can expect an answer to those questions or, better still, to guarantee that those questions will be answered before the Appropriation Bills are finally passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I did ask the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  for some information on whether the toilets which were installed originally in the High Court building were removed and new toilets installed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to make the point that I sat through the meetings of Estimates Committee F when it dealt with the Department of Primary Industry, as did the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I table a number of submissions made to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> during the inquiry into industrial research and development and seek leave to make a brief explanation for doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-84">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such information includes matters of a commercial nature and it has been made clear on a number of previous occasions, as Qantas operates in a commercial <span class="highlight">environment</span>, it would not be appropriate to disclose such information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-127-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  did give me an assurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-111-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, 1 believe that assistance should be accorded by the Commonwealth to local authorities, designed to meet the impact of increased costs, growing population, the changing <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and the ever widening range of services demanded by local communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Fleming could be somewhat influenced by his <span class="highlight">environment</span> rather than by the desire to give an unbiased report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter of the pollution of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> is one that is exercising the minds of many people not only in Australia but overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland in particular the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is threatened in another way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The beauty of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> is something with which we should be concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me refer to what is already being done in the interests of dealing with pollution and the preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the Australian people have become aware that there is a very real necessity for the preservation of their <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that a great deal of this interest has stemmed from the fact that the Commonwealth Parliament, through its committee system, has established a couple of committees that have applied and are applying themselves to the prevention of pollution and the conservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not without significance that several of the State governments have set up committees of one kind or another to investigate and deal with pollution - air pollution, water pollution or pollution of the total <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having made that passing reference to pollution, the next subject with which I should deal is something on the positive side; and that is the conservation of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and particularly the conservation of our water resources both in quantity and in quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They want to live within their family <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the world advances we are finding increasingly the development of international conventions, whether they relate to the safely of aircraft, the passage of aircraft, communications or pollution of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that whilst the Bill will receive a speedy passage attention will be given to providing the Senate from time to time with information on the matter of retaining the quality of our coastal <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>During the past few weeks the sad spectacle of this great tanker going aground on a reef to the north of Queensland, with the consequences of that and the threat to the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Queensland, has been canvassed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the Parliament has already shown a very keen consciousness of the necessity to take adequate steps to protect the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the appointment over a period of time of select committees on the great matters of oil drilling, oil exploration on the Australian coastal perimeter and the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>- whether the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the air or the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the water as referred to by  Senator Davidson  - these matters have received the close and continuous attention of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (2) To ascertain even the approximate cost of 24 Phantom aircraft together with air tankers would necessitate  a  complete evaluation of the aircraft configuration with an assessment of the specialist equipment, engineering changes and support elements required to permit the aircraft to be operated to the best advantage in the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to meet Australian requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were forced to go 37 miles into a bush <span class="highlight">environment</span> for the purpose of living with their promised husbands in the hope that, after associating with the men, the girls would possibly marry them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agenda, as one would expect, was a comprehensive one and covered such questions as the role and responsibilities of medium and small powers in the maintenance of international peace, social progress as a factor and condition of economic development, prospects for agreement on the control of armaments, the role of parliament in the protection of the human <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the conservation of nataral resources for future generations, relations between parliament and local authorities and cultural exchanges as a means of increasing understanding between countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is rather parallel to the situation in relation to the control of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> where we see the States expressly legislating within the competence of State laws in these fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The core of development plans for Alice Springs would be preservation of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>, with tourist facilities blended into the landscape. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reached on my shelves for the glorious publication by the Australian natural painter, Stan Kelly, an engine driver of Ballarat, which contains illustrations of our Austraiian eucalypts and in which he portrays with lovely artistry 240-odd specimens of eucalypts and states that they would be used to beautify the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Alice Springs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I am happy to take this opportunity to refute any suggestion that intensive development proposed in Alice Springs involves a violation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> such as has been suggested here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Highlands there is a temperate climate with high rainfall, but when one goes down to the coastal areas one experiences a hot and steamy <span class="highlight">environment</span> with heavy monsoonal rains during certain periods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In these vast areas there are great extremes in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and sophistication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The vocational training that they receive assists them in the various fields of employment which are open to them and in their own particular <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The more important measure provides, in effect, statewide industrial zoning regulations: Instead of just moving into any community where it has land, an industry first must have its plans approved by Maine’s Environmental Improvement Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>insists that new industrial facilities of any kind be located so as to cause “minimal adverse impact on the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>.” <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They get them home and they produce a much stronger type of wool than they anticipated due to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have told honourable senators that 1 do not believe that the type of wool that we have in Australia will necessarily be produced in overseas countries because of the effect that <span class="highlight">environment</span> has on the product. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are introducing new blood into our own cattle breeds to try to develop a breed of cattle which is suitable for the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, we have a breed which is suitable to our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister tonight said that it is utter hogwash because he talked about the importation of fine wool rams into Western Australia from Tasmania and said that the fine wool sheep could not be reproduced in Western Australia because of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I agree with the Premier that the Vietnam Campaign is pollution of the Parliament of South Australia, pollution of the community and, as he said himself, pollution of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the load on the shoulders of young people undertaking this task is so great that very often it contributes to a break up of the home and the home <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have come to the stage where the quality of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the essential natural aspects of our life, including the unique wildlife of Australia, are important parts of those things that give human happiness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If one goes out to the Tidbinbilla reserve, which 1 had the privilege of doing recently, one sees the utmost friendship that exists between the animals in a proper <span class="highlight">environment</span> and visitors, lt is a real education in the pleasure which people derive from seeing wildlife. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not fully realised yet how wildlife in a proper <span class="highlight">environment</span> such as national parks and reserves, could enhance that business and act as a terriffic magnet to increase it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the extraordinary manifestations in our contemporary history is the growing concern and the acute alertness of the modern world to the significance of <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the enthusiasm that is now apparent in this country and throughout the world for the preservation and conservation of national and international environments is mobilised, if there is the necessary exchange of technical skills from one country to another, and if that is mobilised in this country by the interest of the Commonwealth in co-operation with the States to create legislation ultimately - whether in the form suggested by  Senator Mulvihill,  by the passage of an appropriate Act of this legislature, or by parallel legislation in this legislature and in the State Parliaments, or in some other way - then Australia will be taking her place in this new army of international enthusiasts for the preservation of the national and the international <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The case for cooperation by the States to protect our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to protect the lives of our marsupials has been established here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a direct destruction of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have set up all sorts of committees to investigate the attack upon our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are arrangements which should he brought under the control of a single commission, either an environmental council or a national conservation commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite their  comments  about aboriginal housing and education, you won’t find them engaged in the difficult task of trying lo educate these children who live in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> nol conducive to rapid education, or attempting the frustrating task of training Aboriginals to occupy accommodation quite foreign to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not suggesting that the people who would staff these services would not be dedicated people determined to do their best; but they would be servants of the state and in fact they would be in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> (hat breeds that type of attitude which as we have heard many times from members of the Opposition, is to be found in any government run show. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior read the text of the address given to the Canberra chapter of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects and the Royal Australian Planning Institute by  Dr J.  G.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister take heed of this analysis and tell the National Capital Development Commission that the environmental ravishment of the Black Mountain region by the building of additional roadways is not warranted to placate a few impatient motorists who, if time is so vital to them, should get out of bed 30 minutes earlier and not bludge on people who want to preserve the best features of the Australian Capital Territory bushland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a simple recognition of the fact that the production <span class="highlight">environment</span> differs in the different States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like the Minister to answer me and to indicate whether if this is not done the Corporation, by this clause, is concerned only with ownership of shares and is not concerned with the policy or the operation of that company and with what it does with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> which surrounds its operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that the corporation would have taken steps to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which we have to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members should remember this, that the overseas concerns are not worried about our <span class="highlight">environment</span> at all because they do not have to live in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today more and more people who live in cities wish to experience this type of <span class="highlight">environment</span> and yet it is continually being destroyed by overseas companies because we do not control their policy and they are not concerned about our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I am making is that these companies not only have no concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> but also they have no concern for the financial position of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt has been suggested that the words Human Settlements’ in paragraph (l)(f), although entirely appropriate and technically correct, might be better replaced by the words ‘Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt was agreed that changes in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> which could trigger off a population explosion were often subtle and seldom had a single cause: a rise or fall in surface sea temperatures was cited as a possible triggering cause, lt was also recognised that this type of speculation, though worthwhile, would yield little of practical importance in the absence of much more data about the biological, hydrological, ecological, nutritional and life cycle conditions of the Great Barrier Reef than is at present available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The work of the research vessels and research teams which have been engaged on this task for a number of years and which I presume will continue to be engaged, when allied with some of the research work carried out at Townsville, should have a generally beneficial effect for Australia in relation to its marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have many examples of the genuine interest that has been shown by the Prime Minister of this country in questions of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and, in particular, in questions concerning the tropical waters of the Great Barrier Reef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One example, which I was going on to quote and which I will now quote, is that the Government, being interested in the preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, moved for and set up committees on air pollution and water pollution, both of which have now produced reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that those reports, taken together, will assist the Government in reaching some sort of programme in relation to the control of the deterioration and pollution of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To suggest, as  Senator Keeffe  did, that here we have ad hoc-ery at its worst, with no apparent and real interest in the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, is to make a suggestion that simply is not supported by the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that it has not been obvious is shown when one recalls that these committees were set up early in 1968 before the general public had been made as aware as it is now of the problems of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the problems of pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This representative meeting also believes that in the interest of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and the co-ordination of the activities of all the States in the field of pollution, a National <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council should be established by the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How fair is it to industry in Australia that in one State its cost of produc tion should be very much higher than in another State because in one State it is required to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as an inevitable element of its cost of production <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, compelled under law to do so; whereas in another State it is able to expend the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and so put its product on the market at a cheaper price and gain a benefit for itself not by expending its own funds in producing that product but by expending that which is owned by the public and which is sacred to the public, that is, the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, which is something that cannot be replaced - or not quickly anyway? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the appropriate standing committee is formed - the appropriate one would seem to be the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> - I believe that the proper course would be for the Senate to continue its interest in this field by establishing perhaps a sub-committee of that Committee to keep the field under observation and supervision and to see to it that this report is implemented to the extent that the Senate is capable of doing that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, as mentioned in the report of the Senate Select Committee on Air Pollution, ‘in any future arrangements for the study of pollution problems, cognisance should be taken of the total <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the interaction of the different facets of what is virtually one problem’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it was  Senator Cant  who referred earlier to a section of the last annual report of the Commissioner of Trade Practices in which it is indicated that many of the restrictive agreements which exist at the moment stem from price control in wartime and the unwillingness of many people to depart from the practices which a price control <span class="highlight">environment</span> created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is also to be considered the contribution that nuclear power can make to a reduction in pollution of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, particularly in pollution of the atmosphere by harmful smoke and dust and various gases, sulphur and nitrogen oxides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The committee whose establishment was proposed in August last year is to have the task of looking into the social <span class="highlight">environment</span> of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the most important committees remaining to be established is that associated with social <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>where there has been a tremendous increase in the construction, of high rise housing, lt is hardly a suitable <span class="highlight">environment</span> ici which to raise families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Federal Parliament has the right, under the original agreement of 1945  -  it was subsequently renewed from time to time - to discuss with the States not only the amount of money that the Commonwealth will lend to them for housing but also the type of housing that we believe is needed and the type of <span class="highlight">environment</span> required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposition before the Senate is simple enough, namely, that there shall be referred to the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> the question of housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, the type of motion that  Senator Murphy  has propounded contemplates the appointment of the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> because it contemplates that there shall be an immediate reference to that Committee when the members are appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By an odd circumstance, we find ourselves in a situation in which  Senator Byrne  is saying: ‘We are not prepared to vote against the motion in  Senator Murphy’s  name at the moment, but we are prepared to wait, and we think it is logical to wait, until the Senate decides whether in fact it will have a Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and then decide whether this would be a suitable matter for it to examine’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question we are deciding on this occasion is whether we should refer to the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> an inquiry into housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addressing my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, who represents the Prime Minister, I refer to the decision of the Prime Minister, firstly, to proceed to the establishment of an Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> which was to deal wilh pollution in Australia, and secondly,. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However 1 point out that when the decision was taken not to establish’ the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> it was made clear by the Prime Minister that the decision related only to a deferment for the time being of the formal establishment of the office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In suggesting this I have chosen the Standing Committee on Education Science and the Arts and the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is suggested in the document Committees of the Australian Senate’ that we should move into 2 more immediately or as soon as possible, the 2 suggested committees being the Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts and the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I propose now to refer particularly to paragraph (2) (d) of the resolution proposed by the Leader of the Government where the Minister recommends that the committees to be next fully established be the Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts and the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He referred to that part of  Senator Sir Kenneth  Anderson’s motion which says that the next 2 committees to be geared into action as operative standing committees shall be the Committee on Education, Science and Arts and the Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of that amendment would be to delete from the motion the section that refers to the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and to replace it with our suggestion for the appointment of the Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the petitions relating to crime in Australia presented to the Senate on 28th October 1970 and 2nd November 1970 by  Senator Cavanagh  and referred to the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare on 3rd November 1970 be now transferred from the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare to the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and that the latter Committee be empowered to take into consideration and further pursue any inquiries or actions already initiated by the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare in regard to the petitions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That there be referred lo the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  the  following matter - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#debate-89">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the continuing oversight of the problems of pollution, including ways and means of preserving the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from pollution; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#debate-89">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently the Senate decided that the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> be appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#debate-89">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> having been appointed, we have a body which could usefully continue to work on this problem of pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#debate-89">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the Duke of Edinburgh in Canberra, it is timely to mention his warnings on polluting our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#debate-89">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that he had noticed a marked shift in recent years to a concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> - a concern to make this country a satisfactory place in all respects for civilised and rewarding human existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#debate-89">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must think not only of our own enjoyment and use of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> but of the next generation and following generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#debate-89">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must try to restore the damage that we have done to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and then ensure that our future actions do not generate other pollution problems for subsequent generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#debate-89">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This includes industry, which must take a very large measure of responsibility for polluting our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#debate-89">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not nearly enough when one considers the amount of damage caused to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#debate-89">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part of a Problem  -  Water pollution is only part of a much broader pollution problem which is threatening our whole national <span class="highlight">environment</span>, lt can be solved most effectively by tackling it as a national problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#debate-89">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existence in Australia of many societies, voluntary organisations and individuals already dedicated to a particular aspect of environmental protection is widespread and plainly evident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#debate-89">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Merely as illustrations, we refer here to bodies such as the Aus tralian Conservation Foundation, the Colong Committee, the Great Barrier Reef Committee, the National Parks Association of New South Wales, and to the very many individuals who are greatly concerned about aspects of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> such as the protection of the coastline, the preservation of wildlife, and the maintenance ir their natural state of water bodies such as the Myall Lakes in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#debate-89">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Leader of the Opposition will agree when he looks at the official title of the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and when he looks at the terms of reference which he himself has proposed should be submitted to the Committee that the matters referred to it are not simply confined to the areas of air and water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, in some report which I read recently the matter of pollution and <span class="highlight">environment</span> relates not only to air and water but also to the areas of noise, soil, the sea and coast and perhaps even includes radioactivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However from the remarks the Leader of the Opposition has made the Senate will readily understand that he is painting a broad canvas in connection with <span class="highlight">environment</span> and pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inclusion of the term ‘social <span class="highlight">environment</span>’ in the very title of the Committee to which we are referring paints a broad picture and goes far beyond the areas of air and water, ft is natural that  Senator Murphy  and all of us who may speak in this debate or who may have any connection with the Committee will have a deep and continuing interest in these 2 areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The words ‘pollution’ and ‘<span class="highlight">environment</span>’ are  words which are  constantly bandied about today so much so that sometimes we bandy them around in contexts where it is difficult to take them seriously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That there be referred to the Standing Committee on social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> the following matters - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the examination of the necessary steps to ensure the continuing oversight of the problems of pollution, including ways and means of preserving the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from pollution; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘Social <span class="highlight">environment</span>’ is a somewhat new term in Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The resolution proposes to refer to the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> the 2 matters which are set before us on the notice paper today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hardly think that the Leader of the Opposition is suggesting the maintenance of a Senate Standing Committee to be constantly in office as a body exercising a continuing oversight of the problems of pollution, including ways and means of preserving the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather I suggest that the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> might come into this Senate with a report following upon what I would hope would be the examination of the necessary steps to ensure the continuing oversight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, The Senate Standing Com- mittee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> if it so thought might well recommend to the Senate that a body, either existing or yet to be recommended, might be the body which would ensure the continuing oversight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>T hatthere be referred to the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> the following matters - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the examination of the necessary steps to ensure the continuing oversight of the problems of pollution, including ways and means of preserving the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from pollution: and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was brought hometothe Committee many limes during the enquiry that air pollution is but one small part of man’s contamination of his <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pollution of the water resources of the world, pollution of the soil and, in this mechanised world of ours, pollution of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by the noise of man’s activities are all parts of the same problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, the emphasis is on the fact that that inquiry revealed that air pollution is but one small part of man’s contamination of his <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Water pollution is only part of a much broader pollution problem whichis threatening our whole national <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee therefore considers that, in any future arrangements for the study of pollution problems, cognisance should be taken of the total <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the interaction of the different facets of what is virtually one problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, for those two reasons - the total pollution problem in the sphere of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the fact that both the committees that have already done work on this matter considered that a national approach was not only desirable but also necessary - I believe that paragraph  (2)  of the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition should read: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that that provides the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> with the opportunity to discuss very definitely the recommendations and conclusions presented in those  2  reports and to present recommendations to the Senate as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we give it too broad a canvas or if we make its terms of reference too uncertain, it may go on and on and, because circumstances can change, the whole area of the study of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> may well be brought into disrepute and also the whole Senate committee system may run the risk of being in danger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very popular today to be on the bandwagon of the pollution of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well to criticise industry, communities and even humanity for what they are doing to the various elements of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But never let us forget that in our acceptance of the standards of living that we enjoy, appreciate and talk about we run the risk of being offenders against our social <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I express the hope that in the end the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, in the motton that is before us tonight, will have clear guidelines and clear directions as to the areas in which it is to operate and the areas on which the Senate expects it to report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The States had been activated very considerably to operate in this field of the control of pollution of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposal of the Water Pollution Committee was that the Commonwealth should move quickly so that it might capture the activity and enthusiasm of the States and, contributing ils own activity and enthusiasm by the passage of parallel legislation, produce a national code and a national machine to control the pollution of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> both in the States and in Commonwealth territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without attempting to cover a very broad canvas in one or two sweeps of the brush, it can attempt to pick out the steps that can be taken, that should be taken and that most urgently are required to be taken, and commend those to the Government so that at least step by step a programme of co-operative federalism in the concept of control of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> may be carried into operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the kind of operation that  Senator Davidson  has in mind - not that there should be, as it were, a permanent select committee looking at this question  of  environmental control but a committee which could investigate from time to time one step or another which might be taken, which has not been taken and which should be taken to implement finally a total programme  of  control and protection  of  the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only by confrontation with some of these departments will we be able to get quick measures which will prevent in a practical way intrusions into our existing <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one realises that that is within 20 parts per million of a toxic presence of CO, one realises that it is high time that we as a nation became interested in our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and that what is happening here has not before been completely recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel that the activities of both the Senate Select Committee on Air Pollution and the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution have led to a deep awareness in Australia of a problem of <span class="highlight">environment</span> generally and that therein lies one of the greatest benefits of setting up these committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say again that  Senator Murphy’s  proposal for the reference of these matters to the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> means that the games are over and it is now a serious business to ensure the retention of the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My point in rising was to commend the proposal to refer this matter to the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>(9.55) - The Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Murphy)  has moved that the matter of pollution be referred to the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate has since created the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and this motion moved by  Senator Murphy,  subject to adjustment or otherwise of the wording, seems to me to be a natural consequence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the Petitions relating to crime in Australia, presented to the Senate on 28th October 1970 and 2nd November 1970 by  Senator Cavanagh,  and referred on 3rd November 1970 to the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare, be now transferred from the Standing Committee on  Health and Welfare to the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, and that the latter Committee be empowered to lake into consideration and further pursue any inquiries or action already initialed by the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare in regard lo the Petitions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of the  7  committees in the system which we have proposed, the most appropriate might have been the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> or the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator is aware that an inter-departmental committee met last year and that as a result of that meeting an Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> was established, but obviously there may be some areas in which my Department is maintaining a primary obligation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An office to bring together and generally to superintend the Commonwealth’s work and responsibilities in the environmental field is a new initiative, and an important one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am convinced that people are not aware of the dangers of drugs -  the affluent society; the stresses of modern life; the personality factor; the living <span class="highlight">environment</span>; and advertising and the news media. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 3 aspects which one must look at in the future in an affluent society are (1) the stresses of modern life which I believe are a big factor as to why people try to escape; (2) boredom; and (3) the living <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill proposes the appointment of an additional Minister and a spate of Assistant Ministers but most of the song and dance in justification for the new appointments seem to centre on the new Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposed Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> will be administered by the Vice-President of the Executive Council  (Sir Alan Hulme)  but if it is to have any teeth it needs more than  a  glorified Minister of State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would have imagined that in bringing down a proposal to increase the number of Ministers the Government would have outlined clearly the powers of the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is questionable whether the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, which embraces within the ambit of its functions a consideration of matters related to communications, is the most appropriate body to look at a matter of this character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In those circumstances I feel that there is no alternative but to pursue the motion in the terms in which it has been moved and to seek to have this matter referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although the Standing Orders may suggest that a topic such as this should only be looked at together with a similar committee of the House of Representatives, the Senate could provide that the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> could examine it notwithstanding the Standing Orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The neglect of areas which nobody would consider to be sweet influences on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> indicate that in our housing we have to be more careful not merely in the fancy elements of <span class="highlight">environment</span> but in the fundamental values of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are to have parks and gardens in plenty which are carved out of the land and built up to a standard of beauty and acceptance, and if we are to have sewerage provided, there will have to be a new column in the expenses account for environmental expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consideration has to be given to the distribution of potential income earning capacity via secondary and primary industries, but consideration must be given also to a well balanced basis for that which we are all seeking, that is, a life of happiness and cooperation as a community in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> which has consideration for all sections of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that, in view of all the aspects involved it was a pretty good effort on the part of those concerned to get the legislation to this stage from the end of December, especially in view of the differences of opinion and <span class="highlight">environment</span> as well as the other differences between the States themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can this co-operative effort between the Commonwealth and the State in the preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> be interpreted as the initiation of a continuing constructive and desirable approach to enviromental control? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The initial results of that investigation suggest that the desirability of any Commonwealth action being taken depends upon the approach and the advice indicated by the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> which, as honourable senators will recall, is a further department the Government has decided to create but which, for the time being, has been deferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I think I. indicated, the view which has been formulated by the Government, and with which my Department is in concurrence, is that these matters should properly be undertaken by the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> which at present is under the Department of the VicePresident of the Executive Council and, which will come into full being in due course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:  (1). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>(2) and (3) I have invited State Ministers to an early meeting on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why does not the Government move into these areas to provide finance for our schools, hospitals, roads, transport and housing and to solve our growing problems of pollution and the deteriorating <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recognising that the provision of airports, sea ports and other Commonwealth installations is an important national requirement, will the Government consider the establishment of co-ordinating bodies or at least consultative bodies embracing Commonwealth, State and local authorities so that the total needs of the community, including preservation of the local <span class="highlight">environment</span>, are given every consideration? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one who took part in 2 aspects of this consideration it is clear that what is now proposed to be done is a measure of the heightened sense of awareness of the general public on matters concerning the pollution of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I believe that the first investigation made by the Public Works Committee into this matter was a sound and thorough one it is clear that this new approach comes from general public awareness and a desire for higher standards of cleanliness in the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This inquiry will have a far reaching effect on sewage disposal throughout the area of the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not only a unique occasion but also one which marks in this Senate the heightening awareness of the need for environmental control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Unless they mix into the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and make progress with the language their education is doomed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-55-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for  the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts been drawn to reports of a study made by the Chemistry Department of the University of Tasmania concerning pollution of marine life by metals, which suggests that mercury levels in sea food in some Australian waters are already much higher than is desirable? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, it appears that the report which has appeared in the ‘Australian’ is a report of a preliminary study and that the basis upon which it is made is not available to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts to consider. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 will refer the honourable senator’s question as to action to be taken with regard to the Senate select committee reports on air pollution and water pollution to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts so that he can reply to the honourable senator direct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts had his attention drawn to the widespread response to the television appearances and statements of  Dr Paul  Ehrlich of the United States of America culminating in a repeat screening of his television programme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister agree that this reflects a growing awareness by the Australian community concerning the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The role of the Minister for

    <p>However, if the whole range of

    <p>In the

    <p>The people of

    <p>Local government is perfectly able to

    <p>Our cities are becoming so big and so clogged up by the problems of transport and the provision of services, such as water supply, power reticulation and sewerage, that in the process of attempting to cope with those problems they are getting right away from attending to the quality of life, the betterment of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The simple fact is that this Parliament, the parliaments of the past, and mankind throughout history have been so pre-occupied with living with the material <span class="highlight">environment</span> that they have not studied living with themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts seen  a report from the Queensland Department of Primary Industries stating that Queensland’s kangaroo population was healthy and flourishing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As stated in ray reply to Question 1071 (Hansard, 18 August 1971, page 76), ‘mining and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>’ was among the subjects discussed by Ministers at the May 1971 meeting of the Australian Minerals Council, which includes all State Ministers for Mines as well as Commonwealth Ministers concerned with mining, and I would expect that further meetings of the Council this topic will be prominent amongst those discussed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an activity carried out by the Commonwealth that affects very materially the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the people who live under the flight paths and in the vicinity of Mascot and any airport to be constructed in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They all came to the same conclusion, that the only way to avoid aircraft noise, pollution and other effects upon <span class="highlight">environment</span> is not to build airports near major cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the people in the 2 subject sites will be affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the matters of zoning, <span class="highlight">environment</span>, pollution and congestion are so paramount in the minds of people today that this statement needs to be given further consideration in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The May 1971 edition of the ‘Scientific American’ carried an article entitled ‘Mercury in the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">environment</span> is extremely favourable for its operations because the effluent will flow into mangrove country, which is a breeding ground for plankton and for crustaceans, and so will commence the contamination of the food chain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However I have before me the transcript of an interview in which the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply wish to take this opportunit to remind government generally, and the Minister in charge of questions relating to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, that these actions have been taken, that they are regarded by the Senate as urgent and that they are regarded by the people of Australia as urgent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They also recommended a national approach; that some steps should be taken not necessarily exactly along the lines taken by the Senate Committee but necessarily involving consideration of the question of the extent to which action could be taken under the Commonwealth Constitution either by the Commonwealth or by the Commonwealth and the States acting together to create a national water commission or a national <span class="highlight">environment</span> body of some sort with sufficient power, sufficient teeth and sufficient incentive to take some action to overcome the problems which have been referred to and which are set out, in startling form, in the reports of the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The statement by the new Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  quoted by  Senator Georges  a few moments ago is something else that causes me some concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have reached a year when there is a feeling of international environmental concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are sharing with the thinking people of the world a concern for our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are realising that our responsibilities weigh heavily as we protect and conserve our <span class="highlight">environment</span> for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my State of Victoria <span class="highlight">environment</span> has been a matter of immediate concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government’s role in environmental measures perhaps will lie in the creation of a national advisory council which could work in conjunction with the Slates to share research which is undertaken, or to set up a council for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> which would work with the 6 State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When speaking of environmental measures we must speak of individual responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are talking about environmental measures we must accept that just as the first syllable of management is man, so is it man’s individual responsibility to ensure that a personal unselfishness and, perhaps, selflessness is brought to bear in the interests of the preservation of our natural resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assume that the new Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts will also be making further opportunities available for research in matters of an environmental nature which directly concern us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said earlier that we had concern about our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These changes are being brought about by changes in our way of life, in our communications and in our <span class="highlight">environment</span> as a result of the gradual rise in our standard of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it may well be argued that the great changes which have taken place since there have been these amendments to the legislation to which I referred earlier this afternoon have come because of a recognition of changed social and economic <span class="highlight">environment</span>, changed attitudes of people and the changed expectations of citizens as to provisions which may be expected from a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it true, as reported in the last issue of the ‘Sunday Australian’, that, despite the fact that the Commonwealth Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> was created 6 months ago, it has no staff? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the answer to these questions is in the affirmative, are we to assume that the Government has in mind for the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> a purely decorative rather than a practical role? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that, as we discuss it now and in the future and as we play our part in the interstate and international discussions on this subject, the whole question of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, population explosion and matters flowing from it will influence political philosophies and principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another worry is that the number of human beings will increase the elements of pollution and damage the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assuming that there will be food, metals and fuel for an X period of time, say 30 years, and the improvement of research will help in the continuation of these, the implications of the population explosion include the question of whether we can support increased numbers without destroying our <span class="highlight">environment</span> of land, sea, air and water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fitting that we are aware of the international conference on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> which is to be held in Stockholm next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Parliament was represented at a conference held earlier this year in: Bonn in relating to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But all of this relates to environmental studies and the total problems of <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of his publications is entitled ‘Population Resources and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a crisis of population and of resources and certainly the crisis relates to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that Australia has no immediate population or environmental problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be said that the general attitude adopted by Australians to the plight of other nations - every week we hear of some problem relating to famine or some other environmental difficulty associated with an overseas country - is the tendency to say ‘We are fortunate that we are here and that we are not there’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To demonstrate the interest which Australia has shown in the past in this subject, 1 quickly state that the Senate by its Committee Reports has taken great steps to alert the Australian population to the problems of pollution of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labour groups, particularly in Victoria, are forcing their views in relation to those matters which are seen to upset the environmental balance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy mentioned the United Nations meeting on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The politician must carefully assess what has been stated lately by prominent sociologists and scientists and do that which is necessary to prevent the destruction of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> by over-population and by over-production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is salutary and timely that we should debate a matter of this nature tonight, realising that in our own activities in Australia there has been an alerting to and an awareness of the situation in respect of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Among the problems that confront the world today, there is none more pressing than those associated with the preservation of the human <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is good to see that in international conventions these days there is deep and wide discussion of where we are heading in an overall context in respect of maintaining the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the whole world and the atmosphere surrounding it while pursuing the activities that we must pursue in providing for the requirements of our population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is largely a matter of sustaining and improving the overall <span class="highlight">environment</span> so that our capacity to continue in food production, for instance, is unimpaired; indeed, so that we may play an increasingly important role in food production to meet the demands of over-populated countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no time at all for the attitude which we bear expressed in Australia that we should not pursue to the uttermost the development of our resources and a continuing increase in our population, although 1 am aware that we must protect our <span class="highlight">environment</span> as far as we possibly can. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are looking continuously at whether weaknesses could develop in our attitude towards environmental matters, which weaknesses would be detrimental to the well being of our people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 feel that the relevant Senate committees have done a national service in alerting the populace generally to the dangers of pollution which arises from a non-awareness of what could transpire were care and heed not taken of overseas experience in relation to the control of <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 1 6th September  Senator Murphy  asked me a question without notice about a letter from the Australian Mass Communications Council to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts concerning the proposed National Film and Television School. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am concerned about tonight - I think the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  would appreciate this - is that this is one of the many situations we are going to be confronted with in that a department with the primary responsibility of combating the various insects affecting a crop may be obsessed with that and not worried about maladjustment of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> that may occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this is a grand opportunity for the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  to come in with all guns blazing and co-opt the various authorities that arbitrate on this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like everyone else in this chamber I have been inundating the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts with all sorts of matters, ranging from limestone to many other things, in respect of which I wanted him to instigate effective planning, utilising the Bureau of Mineral Resources to assess various alternative deposits - in fact the whole range of variations of environmental control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Greenwood obviously has been instructed by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find that  Mr Howson,  the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is only one claim that will be made tonight but 1 know from correspondence I have received from quite a number of environmental groups that it will continue to go on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts continues to adopt a Pontius Pilate attitude it does not say much for the research that  Senator Davidson, Senator Rae  and other people who served on the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution engaged in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we move into this emerging area concerning effects on the habitat of birds and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> generally, once again we are essentially in a State area of responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth has established a new Department of Thc <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite apart from environmental matters problems are created by the interest of the Department of Primary Industry and the conceivable interest, to which  Senator Mulvihill  referred, of the Department of Education and Science, which is responsible for the administration of CSIRO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also the fairly pervading influence of the Commonwealth Department of Health, and in a position yet to be evolved in these areas there is the responsibility of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the difficulty of the Ministry for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> taking over a problem which is essentially that of Primary Industry - the problem of protecting those people who are likely to be subjected to the ravages of the locusts as is in contemplation at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it more important to protect the hundreds of thousands of farmers who may have their crops destroyed or is it more important to protect that which is constituted by the concept of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and all the matters of which  Senator Mulvihill  spoke? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Committee is requested to recommend, on or before 30th September 1972, what legislative and administrative measures should be taken by the Commonwealth to preserve the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to prevent pollution by the Clutha Project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Committee is of the opinion that the Report of Estimates Committee B relating to the slow progress in the establishment of the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is of grave concern and expresses the view that urgent action should be taken by the Government to establish an effective organisation to deal with the problems of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the functions set out was activity relating to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, including the responsibility for the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is what has come to be called ‘the <span class="highlight">environment</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An office to bring together and generally io superintend the Commonwealth’s work and responsibilities in the environmental field is a new initiative, and an important one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has seemed desirable at the same time to add what will be a rapidly developing role m relation to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth, by establishing an additional portfolio by the Ministers of State Bill, accepted its responsibility in the environmental field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It said that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> was a new initiative on behalf of the Commonwealth, that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> was an important matter for the Commonwealth and that it would take a rapidly developing role in relation to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shortly after that the present Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  was allotted that portfolio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that his portfolio is that of Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts and Minister-in-Charge of Tourist Activities, but there appears to be nothing relating to tourist activities in the heading set out in the Particulars of Proposed Expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the facts about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> within the sphere of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and Ihe Arts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that apart from the all-embracing heading ‘Administrative’ there is not one word mentioned about the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt appears that the total number of officers in the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>want to establish the anatomy of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> section of the Department as distinct from the other sections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many of the 75 people would be engaged exclusively on environmental matters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The approved establishment of the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Division is 7. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 2 senior positions in the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Division - First Assistant Secretary and Assistant Secretary - were created on 20lh May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I think the important point with the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Division is that it is true, as the Minister says, that I have jurisdiction over this area of the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as there is an office of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> which is nol, at least as yet, categorised as a separate division, thai will be directly within the responsibility of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think one must appreciate that this is u new Department, that Commonwealth responsibility with regard to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is a recently accepted responsibility and that the extent of that responsibility is hogtied by constitutional limitations :Ind ‘here is a very real .limit to the effective work which can be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have been told that the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Division has one and a bit officers and apparently no specific policy has been determined or outlined for this Division of a department which is to have a total staff of 75 officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only last week the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> presented to the Senate its report on Canberra sewage effluent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The administrative step of establishing the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> within the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts has been taken by the Commonwealth, but this Office appears at the time of the preparation of this report to have done little more than play the part of a liaison agency without developing the operative co-ordinating role in Federal action that seems desirable to focus the Commonwealth’s multifarious interests in spheres of activity bearing on environmental problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that, if the Senate believes in the committee system, as it does, and especially in the select committee system, and if we want action taken on reports of those committees, we cannot tolerate the present situation where there is such slowness in  bringing up to its full establishment of 7 the staff of the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to speak to the question of the activity or inactivity of the Government in relation to environmental control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate has been very deeply concerned about the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, has created 2 committees and has commended proposals in relation to one aspect for urgent attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bodies which were created, re-created or strengthened under those Acts were the State Pollution Control Commission and the Metropolitan Waste Disposal Authority, and an <span class="highlight">environment</span> improvement committee was to be set up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Victoria has been conscious of the need for environmental projection, which was evident from the many Acts in that State dealing with this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My recollection is that there was such a variety of legislation and authorities with jurisdiction in one area or another of environmental interference, and therefore of control, that it was very difficult for Victoria to operate successfully. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the position in that State now is that the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Protection Act provides for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Authority, the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Council and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Appeal Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bodies that are created are the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Authority and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Council and, at the University of Melbourne, environmental research sponsored by the Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works, the Australian Universities Commission and a consortium of Commonwealth and State governments has been embarked upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that last year an Act called the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Act was introduced and that the Victorian Minister for Public Works,  Mr Byrne  - a man, obviously by his name, of intense and dynamic energy and interest - proposes to introduce 9 anti-pollution Bills in the spring session of the Victorian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What Queensland has done is to set up an <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Control Council and 2 technical advisory committees relating to noise and solid waste disposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland Acts, which are somewhat old now but have operated for some time, are the Clean Air Act 1963, the Clean Air Regulations 1968, the State Development and Public Works Organisation Act Amendment Act 1970 in which provision was made for the establishment of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Control Council, the Litter Act 1971 and proposed legislation on the pollution of waters and the Pollution of Waters by Oil Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In South Australia, the Premiers Department, at the date of the compilation of this information, was awaiting a report from the Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Western Australia, at the time of the preparation of this information a report from the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection was anticipated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Physical <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Act 1970 proposed to set up a Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection which was to be constituted by a Bill to be introduced in 1971 which would constitute also the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Council and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Control Section has been recently established under the portfolio of the Department controlled by the Chief Secretary and a Director of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Control is to be appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Control Bill has been prepared to deal with all the main types of pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is similar to the Victorian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Act, to which I have made reference, and the licensing of scheduled premises, similar to the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could have recommended the use of constitutional power to give ihe Commonwealth an overall disciplinary control of water pollution that would go, perhaps, to pollution of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 do not propose to take the matter beyond that, apart from showing that there is tremendous State activity and it would be a shame if the opportunity were lost by the delay, inattention or disinterest of the Commonwealth Government to co-ordinate all these available activities so that we might get what we call a national approach to the whole question of interference with the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Douglas  McClelland referred to some of the dialogue which ensued between members of Senate Estimates Committee B and the officers of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The witness was referring to retractions on staff recuritment   a decision was made not to formally set tip an Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Division hut when, as it then was, the office of the VicePresident of the Executive Council was formed, it was decided to go ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fortified by that assurance I waited for the honourable Peter Howson, who is Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, to get cracking in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may have been  Senator Greenwood,  deputising for the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, who supplied the answer I have in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that it has overtones for the Western Australian Government, but it is clear that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts has no ammunition to enable him to play a valuable role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I never aim too high and in that way I avoid disappointment, but I suggested to  Mr Howson  that the first thing he could do would be at least to utilise the Bureau of Mineral Resources for a gigantic national mineral survey so that every time there was a controversial mining operation which could be a threat to  the  <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the Minister could say: ‘You cannot operate here, but you can operate there.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that about 95 per cent of the officers of the Department of the Interior support conservation principles, but I had hoped that the appointment of a Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> would give us an edge in making decisions in favour of conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 appreciate that after the conference in Perth it was almost felt that the milennium had arrived, but I do not accept that, lt gets back to my idea of the functions of an Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> should be a sort pf administrative filter who would vet all these ideas and determine what is true and what is false. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the electorate at large 6 months ago when 1 mentioned the name of the honourable Peter Howson in circles interested in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> the light of hope came into people’s eyes, whether on the north coast of New South Wales in a fishing village or out in the central west region of New South Wales where interest was taken in, say, a mining venture or the erection of  pipeline for oil wells. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing was remarkable: Gathered around the table were senators who embrace a variety of political ideologies, but they all accepted that we could learn from countries with federal control of environmental matters and in that way much more effective action in the field of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 hope it will galvanise the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, which is the victim of the big brother attitude of senior Ministers in the Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great deal has been said so far in the course of the discussion of the estimates for the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I propose to have something to say in due course about the basis of the motion which has been proposed by  Senator Douglas  McClelland, but before doing so I would like to refer to the constitutional basis upon which the Commonwealth must determine how it is to act with regard to the broad question of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In starting may I say that, in terms of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as a subject matter of constitutional power, the Commonwealth has no direct legislative powers whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the position is that, under our Constitution, the power to make laws with regard to air pollution, water pollution, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> generally is essentially disposed to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against that background, what has been the development in this area of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate has had 2 committees which have dealt not with the subject of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> but with matters which have come to be part of what is involved in a discussion of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it has been that diligent efforts have been made by the Commonwealth with a view to seeking the co-operation of the Slates with the Commonwealth in various areas relating to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the presentation of the reports of the committees on air pollution and water pollution discussions have taken place with the States in regard to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth has not been slow in setting up Commonwealth-State bodies in other areas and those bodies have some incidental impact on environmental problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, there are 6 existing councils of Commonwealth and State Ministers the activities of which have significant direct environmental consequences and with which any <span class="highlight">environment</span> council necessarily would have to establish a satisfactory liaison. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are all bodies, as I have said, which have as their constitution Commonwealth-State ministerial representation and they all have some responsibilities in the area of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is necessary is for the new State Ministers for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> or the State Ministers with new responsibilities in the field of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> to get together with the new Commonweath Minister for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and try to work out an area of responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, it must be recognised that there is a variety of overlapping authority in the States which does have some impact in the area of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What did  Mr Townsend,  the  Deputy  Secretary of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and ihe Arts, say to Senate Estimates Committee B when he appeared before it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is merely to illustrate the early stages in the formation of the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Division. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But within all this there is continuous consultation with all the executive departments which have some responsibility for the care  of  lbs <span class="highlight">environment</span>, including the Department of National Development, CSIRO and the Department of Health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That meeting last Friday agreed to the establishment of an Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>because 1 know something of the efforts he was under taking, that a very real impetus to the development of that council was given by the present Commonwealth Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  lt is proposed that through this council effective consultation and coordination between the Commonwealth and State Governments will be achieved on appropriate <span class="highlight">environment</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the foremost topics discussed by the Ministers was the need for measures to encourage enterprise and individuals to increase efforts to combat pollution and protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ministers also agreed that there was a need to assess any other possible measures which could encourage the installation of plant, equipment and buildings to yield definite benefits for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> council is to., have prepared a statement of requirements for <span class="highlight">environment</span> research in relation to national and State needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To have this co-operation 1 think that in the first instance we should be matching the diligence of the Slates in respect of their environmental problems through legislative provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we would have a base from which to work to seek this cooperation which I feel is so essential to achieve worthwhile things in Australia in the field of pollution generally and in maintaining our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the report submitted last Thursday by the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, of which I am  Chairman,  we said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such as our Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> -  in the present circumstances  ki  which all the States have embarked on new legislative and administrative initiatives while there has been no specific legislative activity on the Commonwealth’s part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The administrative step of establishing the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> within the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts has been taken by the Commonwealth, but this Office appears at  the  time of the preparation of this report to have done little more than play the part of a liaison agency without developing the operative co-ordinating role in Federal action that seems desirable to focus the Commonwealth’s multifarious interests in spheres of activity bearing on environmental problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my wish and great hope that through this Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> we will achieve those things which will be of permanent benefit to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is impossible to discuss with (he State authorities good ideas for betterment in a general setting, when we have not provided basic foundations to achieve to such betterment, as recommended in reports concerning the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, particularly from the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution and the Senate Select. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More action should be taken which will give us backgrounds which are vitally necessary if we are to give purpose and meaning to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the problems associated with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They obtained and collated a body of evidence never before available in Australia as to the extent and the nature of the problems which confront us in the preservation and protection of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there has been ample opportunity, notwithstanding anything which has been said by the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Greenwood),  as Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  for this Government despite any constitutional problems which may exist to have taken action and to have shown an awareness of the problem and a keenness to take steps to overcome the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far, the steps taken are that last year during the election campaign it was announced by the then Prime Minister that steps would be taken in relation to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>some 14 months after the announcement, all that can be said by the officer who represented the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts before Estimates Committee B is that’one and a bit’ officers have been appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regard the war in relation to the preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as being of significance comparable with that of a war in relation to the preservation of a society from external attack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why I cannot believe that any States would be sufficiently small minded to stand out from a suggestion which was made not in a spirit of taking away from the States their rights but in a spirit of what is the only solution which is available to this country to a problem which is a national problem, if we wish to preserve for those who are to follow us anything like the beauty, the majesty and the integrity of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> which we inherited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose it is fairly easy to become emotional about this question when, like many other honourable senators in this place, I have been involved in a couple of committees relating to specified areas that concern the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and have moved into the area dealt with by the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is probably quite wise to draw attention to the content of the report of the Senate Estimates Committee  B  in which, in referring to the Department  of  the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, there are references to what the Committee called on that occasion it considerable degree of confusion, a lack of information, and slow progress in reaching establishment in certain areas, particularly the section dealing with the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I drew the attention of the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood),  who represented in that Committee the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 asked why there was not an officer concerned particularly with the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I received an answer that indicated that the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> was the central part of the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and I point out again, that in the last three or four years there has been considerable public interest in the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, particularly in the sphere of water management and matters related to air pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reiterated the fact that not only was this of public interest but also there had been a considerable public response both at State level and at local or regional level, and it was a matter of considerable personal disappointment to me that nothing was contained in the estimates and there seemed to be no provision that gave those of us who sat around the table any idea that there had been not only some initiation but also some development within the area of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> within the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts does not go down as the Department that is credited with one and a bit officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the Senate’s attention to the report of the Water Pollution Committee which states that this is only part of a much broader pollution problem which is threatening the whole of our national <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope it will recognise the fact that in this debate on the estimates for this Department, and in the proceedings of the Estimates Committee there has been this expression of strong feeling from senators right around the table, including members of the Government parlies, it should recognise that Australia is in a situation in which, unless there is some form of national leadership, national administration, national co-ordination and national co-operation, it will become the victim of environmental problems in the same way that other countries have become victims of such problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within the next 6 months there will be the great United Nations conference on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I for one am very glad that it took place and that certain things have been laid down, but in his comments this afternoon the Minister referred to the variety of councils involved in the environmental area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that some rights have to be sacrificed so that the freedom of all to enjoy the total <span class="highlight">environment</span> can be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been a study of constitutional, legal, social and all the other environmental problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Matters relating to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> know no Slate boundaries because the coastline goes from Stale to State, rivers flow from Stale to State, the air goes from State to Slate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is extremely important that we recognise it as a matter of grave national importance so that not only in terms of water or air but in the whole concept of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the styles of life which are threatened by reason of our advancing technology the benefit of a good <span class="highlight">environment</span> can be preserved for mankind not only for this generation but also for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In October 1970, the previous Prime Minister,  Mr Gorton,  in his policy speech for the Senate election, announced that the Commonwealth Government would establish an Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make this point: In December, less than 2 months after the Government had been returned at the Senate election, the then Prime Minister wrote to the Premiers of the States inviting their co-operation in coming together to discuss the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It received from 4 of the States an immediate response that they would co-operate, but from 2 States it received the immediate reaction that until those States had set up their own legislative framework with regard to the control of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> they were not prepared to co-operate, lt was not until July of this year that there was a willingness on the part of all States to meet with the Commonwealth to discuss these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the time that the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has been established as part of the central administration of a new department formed in May of this year, there has been achieved, in the face of apparent difficulty and opposition, the agreement to the establishment of Ihe Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe that the fact that an Austraiian Environmental Council has been established is of significance in the Australian approach to these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  2  senior positions in the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Division - First Assistant Secretary  and  Assistant Secretary - were created on 20th May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what bas been done by the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The substantial part of the period from June to November was taken up by the Public Service Board and the Department of the Treasury - not the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts - in dealing with the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Parliament wants to change that system, let it change it; but 1 believe that, on the inadequate information which was available to the Estimates Committee which looked at this matter, there was no warrant for saying that the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts was responsible for slow progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The further point thatI wish to make is this: Accepting as I do the information given by the Attorney-General - for whose information, veracity and opinions I have the greatest of respect - as to the workings of the Public Service in relation to the appointment of officers to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Division of the Department, I can say only that this has demonstrated more vividly than anything else I can imagine in quite some time the need for the Senate to forgo the number of references to Committees which were passed today and to look urgently at the workings of the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only person who has spoken in support of the Government’s contention on this matter throughout the whole of the debate has been the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  who represents the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister seems concerned that as a result of the digging and probing which went on at the Estimates Committee hearing certain facts were elicited.I again remind the Minister that on page 29 of the document entitled ‘Particulars of Proposed Expenditure for the Services of the Year ended 30th June 1972’, under the heading Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts’, we find the following divisions listed: Administrative Assistance for the Arts, Commonwealth Archives Office, Australian Government Publishing Service, Australian War Memorial, Office of Aboriginal Affairs, Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies and National Library of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one finds those divisions listed in the appropriations for the Government for the year, the ministerial portfolio is the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, and no mention is made of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> section of that Department, what does the Government expect? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was when the portfolio of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts was established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although there is an establishment of 75 in the Department - in fact the establishment within the division of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is only 7 - the Australian community would expect in a period of -8 mon:hs more than ‘one-and-a-bit’ officers would have been created to deal with matters relating to the Australian Water Resources Council, the Australian Forestry Council, the Australian Agricultural Council, the Australian Fisheries Council, the Australian Transport Advisory Council and the Australian Minerals Council, just to name those that were mentioned by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the Committee to support this proposition to the hilt and to urge the Government to get on with the job and to tackle the problem of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> because it is much more serious than apparently the Minister seems to think it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst recognising that the Department ot the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>particularly the section dealing with the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>f can only say - and I invite anyone to read this record and to contradict what I say - that I can find no evidence in the Hansard record of a possible concern expressed by any member of the Committee about the progress in reaching the establishment of areas other than the office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  second aspect is that the Govern ment  is concerned  to promote awareness in  the  community in the way that  Senator Rae  expressed  it  of the need to be conscious  of damage to our  inheritance and  our  future  in  what  is  happening to the  <span class="highlight">environment</span> which  we have taken for granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Wales and Victoria..  A  few nights ago honourable senators engaged in a long debate on the shortcomings of the Office of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the debate on the estimates for another department I referred to the rape of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission in the Finniss River region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely there has to come some point in this incessant battle between the conservationists and the mining interests - the people I regard without any qualification as the rapists of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> - when some Minister will say: ‘You can do what you like on 1,000 square mites but the other 800 square miles are off limits’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime any applications for mining leases in the area would be granted on conditions negotiated between the Government and the company concerned, including conditions to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation was that the Leader of the Opposition in this place pleaded with us in that debate  -  I do not have to go to the Hansard record because I think he remembers the occasion well - that we should do something to take this salary out of the public service <span class="highlight">environment</span> where there was a limitation of salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has made some suggestions of which I am sure the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  will take account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the final analysis one would hope that the remedy will be found in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and in the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I assure him that I will have the matter referred to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts and I hope that a speedy response can be given to the honourable senator about the particular matters which are concerning him and members of his union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  said in his second reading speech on the States Grants (Aboriginal Advancement) Bill last October, governments throughout Australia are spending some $44m this year on behalf of 140,000 Aborigines and, in addition, as Australian citizens, they also receive social services and other similar benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should, through its Standing Committee on the Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, examine whether construction of a tower of this nature on Black Mountain is in the public interest, having particular regard to the need to preserve the beauty and environmental quality of the National Capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there is a feature of life in our generation which has come to require our acceptance, it is the conservation of our natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the fauna which inhabit it with us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-62-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to recent statements by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Works that it is the intention of the Government to preserve the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Garden Island and Cockburn Sound, apart from those areas required for the naval facility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister know that the United Nations Conference, and papers recently presented tothe Special Committee  on  Problems on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, specifically refer to the impact  of  man-made lakes on existing eco-systems and the food producing potential of tropical savannah eco-systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister consider that an integrated multi-disciplinary resources study of the entire Ord River Scheme, with regard  to  environmental, economic and sociological aspects, would  be  a worthy contribution by Australia to the United Nations Conference  on  the Human <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As such a programme would  lake  about 5 years,  and  only preliminary work could be done before  June  1972, will the Minister consider presenting such a proposal to the United Nations Conference for endorsement, as an undertaking by Australia on behalf of the global <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United Nations Conference on the Human <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is  not a  scientific conference  at  which technical papers will be presented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, we have sent observers to the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Declaration on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> as well as the Preparatory Committee of the Conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the other, the Australian socio-economic conditions of the Ord area, and hence the impact of environmental changes on the inhabitants, differ vastly from those prevailing elsewhere in the tropics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>More valuable as a model for large-scale irrigation developments in other tropical environments would be the study being made by an international team of experts in the Mekong Valley, with its typical high density development accompanied by social problems of villagers displaced by the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is also relevant to note that the Special Committee on Problems of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> (SCOPE), a high-level international body established in 1968 by the international Council of Scientific Unions, has appointed an ad hoc Committee on Man-made Lakes, so that the subject is by no means being neglected internationally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from current investigations, land surveys by CSlRO’s Division of Land Research in the Old-Victoria region in 1949 and 1952 provided extensive basic information about climate, geology, landforms and soils of the Ord area and examined the relationships between factors of the physical <span class="highlight">environment</span> and growth amd distribution of native vegetation when still little disturbed by human activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>together with South East Asia and the Pacific Ocean, a major segment of our strategic <span class="highlight">environment</span>, its great extent and relative emptiness in the past have of themselves given us security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was suggested that the Commonwealth Government should play its part in financing home care services for the elderly citizens of this community so that, instead of shifting them from their own home <span class="highlight">environment</span> and transplanting them in a home where they were completely strange because the situation was completely foreign to them, the Commonwealth could be engaging in a scheme to keep them in their own homes so that they could live in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> to which they had been accustomed over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do honourable senators opposite believe that public works, agriculture, mining, conservation, lands, decentralisation or the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are important? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a meeting of the chairmen of agencies which advise the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  on support for the arts, it was agreed that our programmes should have the following broad aims: The promotion of a standard of excellence over the whole field of the arts; the widening of access to and understanding and appreciation of the arts in the community generally; the expression of an Australian identity through the arts; and the presentation of Australia’s cultural achievements abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I shall refer what  Senator Keeffe  said to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts so that he can examine the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts aware of the project known as ‘Operation Earth Day 72’  -  an imaginative undertaking launched yesterday by a number of organisations and aimed at concentrating public attention upon the need for balanced development and conservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government commend and study this project with a view to encouraging similar educational promotions towards a continuous and growing public understanding of the vital problems of <span class="highlight">environment</span> and ecology? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether the attention of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not read the letter in the ‘Financial ‘ Review’ but the honourable senator and the person who wrote the letter would be correct in saying that not only the elements of transportation and a new phase of transportation in the air, but also the matter of the environmental impact are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has been kept informed by us of any work which we have done in this regard as, indeed, it has kept us informed of its work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has this disease caused affected trees in streets to lose their leaves and branches to die; if so, does the Minister regard the disease as an immediate threat to Canberra’s <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the sporadic effect of incidence of the disease and its association only with poor drainage it is not regarded as likely to provide a major threat to Canberra’s <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That there bc referred to the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> the following matter: The Petitions presented to the Senate on 21st March 1972 relating to the Postmaster-General’s Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why I do not want to deal with  Senator Cavanagh’s  motion today is that it seeks to refer to the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> certain petitions that have been presented to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I suggest that the question be put on  Senator Cavanagh’s  notice of motion, which is to refer petitions to the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall also direct the attention of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  whom I represent, to the matter to see whether anything can be done on  a  basis which acknowledges the rights of people to move to better jobs and, at the same time, to avail themselves of opportunities to establish businesses in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that great changes are occurring in Australia’s external <span class="highlight">environment</span> which justify a careful and progressive re-evaluation of the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of tonight’s statement then is to define the strategic <span class="highlight">environment</span> which, in the view of the Government, is most likely to exist during this decade and could potentially exist in the 1980s; to describe how in general we believe Australian defence capabilities should be shaped in accordance with the responsibilities of an independent country; to make clear the Government’s policy of strengthening and not withdrawing from our international defence associations; to describe the burdens and the gains and the clear balance of national advantage which we believe flow from these associations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>or seek refuge from contemporary burdens by reducing the country’s defence capabilities and retreating from a military role in helping to maintain the security of the external <span class="highlight">environment</span> in- which Australia is destined for all time to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential to try to foresee the way in which the nations who are great in terms of military and economic power will exercise that power in the area of Australia’s strategic concern - an area which comprehends our northern neighbourhood and the sea and air spaces of the maritime <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is, I believe, an essential ingredient of Australian diplomacy that Australia should be understood to be a country whose security interests are growing; whose population and wealth are growing; and whose determination to take some part in shaping the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which we live is more lively than ever now that the great western powers have served notice that their involvement in lesser situations is not to be taken for granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What can be achieved by a defence programme giving us the ability to project Australian armed strength beyond our continental shores is twofold: It will give future governments options to have some influence on events in our strategic <span class="highlight">environment</span> so that we may contribute to the greater security of all countries in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It believes that only if it preserves these practical options and thus preserves too the evident political option to support its neighbours will its military capabilities support its diplomatic and economic efforts in its <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Senate on 8th March 1972  Senator Kane  asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, the following questions: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts has furnished the following replies: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I present the report from the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> relating to 2 petitions seeking co-operation and financial assistance for crime prevention, together with certain documents and correspondence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In presenting this report, I believe that as  Chairman  of the Committee I should mention some of the important factors that were basic to the Committee’s deliberations on the 2 petitions seeking co-operation and financial assistance for crime prevention which were referred originally to the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare, and were later transferred to the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> considered this to be a proper course to adopt and took note of the comments received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 found, when  Senator Laucke,  the  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, presented to the Senate the report of that Committee on petitions seeking co-operation and financial assistance for crime prevention, that I could not agree with a number of comments which were made in his introductory remarks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> had not been established when the petitions were presented and they were referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare, from which committee they came to the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of what  Senator Keeffe  has said, I think that an adjournment of the debate should be sought and that the resumption of the debate should be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting in order to give those honourable senators who are not members of the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> an opportunity to read this report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not certain of the facts in regard to this matter or of whether the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts is the appropriate Minister to whom the question should be directed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Particular attention is given to these elements as they are considered potentially the most hazardous of the radioactive materials relased into the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from nuclear testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The second Commonwealth committee is the National Radiation Advisory Committee (NRAC) which reports to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts and advises the Commonwealth Government on matters concerning the effects of ionising radiation, whatever its origin, on the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The normal gamma radiation in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is many times these levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These additions to the radioactive contamination of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, however, are being made against a background of the strontium 90 and caesium 137 remaining from the earlier tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In conclusion, I take the opportunity to report to the House the possible effect in Australia from the accidental release of plutonium 238 to the world <span class="highlight">environment</span>, a matter that has received some publicity recently in the Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Newspaper reports have referred to the release of plutonium 238 into the world <span class="highlight">environment</span> in April 1964 as a result of the burn-up of the power generator contained in a United States satellite which disintegrated on entering the upper atmosphere after failing to gain the desired orbit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The International Commission on Radiological Protection has undertaken detailed study and has adopted a level of concentration of plutonium 238 in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> to which the general population could be exposed continuously without significantly endangering its health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The current concentrations of plutonium 238 in the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>, which are generally representative of the southern hemisphere are between one ten thousandth and one thousandth of the International Commission on Radiological Protection levels and can in no way be considered a hazard to health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the Postmaster-General’s Department, Central Administration Board’s Policy of recentralising and concentrating certain staffs, under what is called the Area Management Project, to the great detriment of the economics of the towns and related rural areas, and to the detriment of the overall morale, efficiency and independence of the Australian Post Office is against the public interest and should be made the subject of special investigation by the Senate’s Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Committee and by the Senate’s Finance and Government Operations Standing Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A competitive <span class="highlight">environment</span> keeps businessmen on their toes; encourages innovation and trying to do better than the other fellow, and, it should be emphasised, through making the automatic passing on of increased costs more difficult, discourages soft attitudes towards excessive wage demands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 want to say quite frankly that for some time prior to the hearing of the Committee in Perth I had been assisting the Western Australian organisation known as <span class="highlight">Environment</span> 2,000 in the preparation of the case it would put to the Public Works Committee for extra public access to Garden Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator GREENWOOD- The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Honourable Peter Howson, M.P., Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts (Leader) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts and Minister in Charge of Tourist Activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A portfolio was created to cover conservation and  Mr Howson  is now Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The points made by the previous  speaker  on the preservation of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and related matters are significant when one comes to consider the types of forests to be planted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is an urgent need for resources evaluation to provide for all the future needs of an expanding community in Northern Australia; and (ii) a reservation programme to meet present and future needs of conservation of timber, soil, water, wildlife and <span class="highlight">environment</span> before committal of the land to single purpose exploitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some  2  years old plots of the species are already  in  excess of 20 feet in height and it appears that a thorough testing of this genera in relation  to  species, <span class="highlight">environment</span>, provenance and phenotype  is  warranted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Professional advice made available to the Government, both departmentally and from independent sources, is almost unanimous that elderly people should be encouraged to remain in their domestic <span class="highlight">environment</span>, as long as they are able to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time, the plan is designed to ensure the continuance of nursing homes as a recognised form of institutional care, particularly for chronically ill aged persons who can no longer be adequately cared for in a domestic <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee is responsible to the Minister for Supply for safety aspects of the use of testing of nuclear explosive devices in Australia, for evaluation of proposals by other countries to explode nuclear devices outside Australia which might give rise to increased levels of radioactivity in the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> arising from activities with nuclear explosive devices either in this country or elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of the development of Australia’s natural resources consonant with the protection of the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> is becoming of tremendous significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do not move now to ensure the elevation of environmental concern to a very high national position, the opportunity will inevitably and irrevocably be lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why with a Bill of this nature we are disposed to propound an operative amendment in terms of our concern for the preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since then the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  has made a statement on the subject; but I should like to see a more recent statement showing what steps have been taken to implement or to adopt, or to adopt with qualifications, the recommendations of that Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have taken the lead, particularly in this chamber, for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and the States should be told by this method that we hope that they would be parties to the incorporation within any CommonwealthState agreement on their side of this recognition of the need for environmental reference in any agreements which may he entered into for the provision of finance to supplant indigenous growth by exotic forest planting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the first amendment is to ensure primarily that the principles which were set forward not only in our deliberations and in the decisions taken by our conference, but in the announcement by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, are observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, our amendment emphasises the importance we attach to environmental matters in any question of redevelopment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not think for one moment that consideration for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> should of necessity and inevitably surmount every other consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know there must always be found that reconciliation between the legitimate need to explore natural resources and the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and sometimes one or the other may have to be sacrificed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important thing is that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> shall not be disregarded, that it shall be given its due place and at least shall be a matter of concern when a judgment has to be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a study of the effect the project will have on the local <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the local fauna and the local flora. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So an impact study is not merely a study that looks at whether one will conserve as much water by the growing of pines as by the growing of eucalypts but the whole effect on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the ecology of the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is not too much to say in this new concept of environmental concern that is developing all over the world that this is a matter that should be taken into consideration in any developmental project where there is a danger of disturbance of the ecology or the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by the contemplated commercial venture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that because of the continued lack of planning in this industry on the part of Commonwealth and State governments we have run into problems so far as the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is concerned and so far as the preservation of flora and fauna are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Kane’s amendment, to which I draw  Senator Byrne’s  attention, is directed towards environmental matters which I touched on earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this connection it is relevant that the Australian Forestly Council has discussed at length the necessity to consider the effect on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of forest management practices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one regards oneself as a person concerned with the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, pollution of the air and all the ecological factors one should bear in mind that one of the great things that we want close to great concentrations of people is huge, dense forests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am optimistic enough to believe that in the calm of tomorrow when  Senator Cotton  browses through Hansard and he has to explain to his fellow Ministers what the amendment meant, if this arbitration structure on <span class="highlight">environment</span> or conservation is carried- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as natural forests are concerned, I am afraid that I cannot speak with great knowledge of the situation in New South Wales or Queensland, but certainly in relation to the natural forests which exist in my own State of Victoria and in Tasmania I am aware that there is great environmental interest if <span class="highlight">environment</span>’ covers the regeneration of the type of forest which exists in natural forests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his mind it is the impact that it will have on the whole subject of environmental life and flora and fauna in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he an expert on clearing land, on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> or on wildlife? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, the question is asked: What is an environmental impact study all about? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who have remained in the chamber and who have taken an active interest in this debate - I have paid them proper tribute at an earlier stage - might like to learn some of the factors that are believed to be important in the environmental impact position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general terms the impact on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of afforestation is almost entirely favourable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Forest services are now very conscious of their environmental responsibilities, as well as those of conservation and the wise use of resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both the environmental and productive values are highly significant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An increasing variety of native animals, birds, etc, have adapted or are becoming adapted to the recently established coniferous <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who is interested in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> would be forced to support the amendment because we may do irreparable harm if we simply allow States to go ahead with the destruction of indigenous forests in order to plant softwoods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 2 fields of thought ‘ in Australia and, as  Senator Byrne  said, we are getting more <span class="highlight">environment</span> conscious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see the necessity for the non-destruction of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the high priority that we put on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> today I think that this subject should be given more careful study in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will members of the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> be able to peruse such reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Can a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> attend meetings of the Committee or be provided with a summary of the proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Atomic Energy Commission is a subsidiary of the National Development Ministry why was this ministry given inflated committee membership when the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts was excluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At end of motion add ‘and that the medical, social environmental, and legal aspects of the report and recommendations of the Committee be referred to the Standing Committees on Health and Welfare, Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Constitutional and Legal Affairs, respectively, and that these 3 Committees be authorised to undertake the continuing oversight of those aspects and to recommend from time to time what further measures might be taken to implement the recommendations or to overcome the problems revealed in the report’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They, too, hold in their hands the intelligent handling of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our eighth recommendation, which is perhaps one of the most important to be considered right across the spectrum of human endeavour, referred to the living <span class="highlight">environment</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The priority being placed on growth, development and material wealth should be critically examined so that greater resources may be devoted to improving the living <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we hit the nail on the head - we have not been alone in making this opinion known - when we said that a lot of the problems of drug misuse and drug abuse are the result of our living <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the age in which we live and the manner in which we live in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if we are really to try to beat the drug menace in Australia it is important that we get to people not only through education but also through the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The concept of an impact statement’ designed to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> was first outlined in the Senate by the Attorney-General on behalf of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts on 24th May 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For once it is very good to hear that a programme which, after ali, changes our <span class="highlight">environment</span> has no opponents on the grounds of ecology or anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I, like some of my friends in the Senate and particularly  Senator Cavanagh  who expressed a point of view the other night,, agree that we have to watch this sudden enthusiasm for not changing the ecology and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this country it is  necessary toremember always that it was –the changing of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> as: it was when discovered by people who .came from Europe in the early days which, has made it possible for what was once almost a desert to bloom and blossom in small parts today and give us a satisfactory way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The resolution of the Senate, as set out in that report, was that the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> report on the content, form and presentation of the information section of the telephone directories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senators will be aware that amongst the 7 legislative and general purpose standing committees of the Senate there is one entitled the ‘Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These 2 words ‘Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>’ would seem to indicate that a whole range of matters might be referred to that Committee without very much regard to their relationship to the type of committee that it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The crux of the company’s case was that continuation of the stable economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> created by the competitive 2 airline system was absolutely vital before the ATI board could involve its 50,000 investors in the substantial loan commitments needed for additional aircraft, the repayment of which would extend well past the present agreement expiry date of 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minis ter for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator GREENWOOD- The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, ls it a fact that at 2 recent international conferences Australia managed to record 2 different votes on the same subject of a 10-year moratorium on the commercial killing of whales? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that at the Stockholm Conference on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> the Australian delegation, led by  Mr Howson,  voted for the moratorium and that 3 weeks later at the International Whaling Commission conference in London the Australian delegation, which on that occasion did not include  Mr Howson,  abstained from voting on the same question? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts will be very keen to answer it as soon as he can. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Senate was last discussing the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> on telephone directories, which was last Thursday, I had been indicating the course of action which had been taken by the Postmaster-General  (Sir Alan Hulme)  and the Postmaster-General’s Department in the light of the recommendations which had been made by the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the member of this chamber who was responsible for proposing the referral of an inquiry into telephone directories to the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, I am naturally interested in the activities of the Committee and its deliberations and recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to ask a question which perhaps  Senator Laucke  as  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> may be able to answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> I have listened with great interest to honourable senators who have taken part in the discussion and debate on the reference given to the Committee by the Senate on 13th May last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have been asked: ‘How come a reference such as this was made to the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social <span class="highlight">environment</span> encompasses a tremendous range of interests, which is evident from the wide variety of subjects referred by the Senate to the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The word <span class="highlight">environment</span>’ taken alone immediately conjures up in one’s mind those elements of nature which constitute the immediate surroundings in any given place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">environment</span> as such is in the public mind in this sort of . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when we refer to the social <span class="highlight">environment</span> it opens up a terrific area of interest impinging On the very way of living in almost every facet of the social and economic life in the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has referred to it the matter of telephone directories was in accord with this extremely wide area which the social <span class="highlight">environment</span> encompasses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to take up the discussion on the report on Canberra sewage effluent, which has been tabled in this Senate by the  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another background was the terms of reference of the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That there be referred to the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> the following matter: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the continuing oversight of the problems of pollution, including ways and means of preserving the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from pollution; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the report states, the terms of reference were wide-ranging and gave the Committee a continuing charter - a charter to exercise, on behalf of the Senate, an oversight of the problems of pollution and ways and means of preserving the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee was entrusted with something which was described as the continuing oversight of the problems of pollution including ways and means of preserving the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from pollution, and making recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Water pollution is only part of a much broader pollution problem which’ is threatening our whole national <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, having a particular job to do, was confronted with a situation in which there was a water question which involved a national capital area and State geographical areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the activity of the Senate Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> represents the first step towards taking a responsible decision in relation to its pollution terms of reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department under tha control of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  seems to be an organisation that other departments merely put up with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It never seems to be a matter to be dealt with by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this debate we are dealing with a report of the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, dealing specifically with the problem of Canberra sewage effluent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for the purpose of this debate I do not think it would be appropriate for me on behalf of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  to refer to that aspect in detail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> made inspections of the waterways and treatment facilities and took evidence about the quality of effluent and the treatment operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Davidson  mentioned the overriding reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>; that is, the continuing oversight of the problems of pollution which includes pollution of water and air and noise pollution - whatever type of pollution it may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They concern employment and, as such, are related to both physical and psycho.ogical needs - the need for the material support which flows from regular and satisfactory earning levels and the need for psychological support which flows from the sense of wellbeing and confidence which comes from doing a worthwhile task in the best possible <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a reference already in my name to the Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts to which it is proposed to refer this matter in relation to the education of deprived children, that is, children who come from certain economic and geographic areas and who by virtue of some degree of intellectual starvation or lack of communication within the domestic <span class="highlight">environment</span>, arrive at school somewhat disadvantaged when compared with their contemporaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I preface my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration by referring to a minority report from the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> on crime in which I advocated that passport control place greater emphasis on criminal than on political activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It takes enormous capital resources and enormous know-how by international companies such as Vesteys to sustain the proper breeds of cattle in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they will be grazed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if assistance were poured in and even if Aboriginals were left for a short period on their own in the climatic conditions of that <span class="highlight">environment</span>, one bad season would wipe out the business enterprise and if they were not rescued the whole of the Gurindji tribe would be wiped out as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not criticise the Aboriginal people here, but because they had become accustomed to their <span class="highlight">environment</span> they did not even leave the tin huts in the middle of the night but urinated against the wall until they had rotted the walls away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the circumstances of history and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> that have led to a way of life that was necessary in those circumstances to survive but which is no longer necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will be continuing that line of action and I will be talking again with the Minister for the Interior and, I hope, with the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  about providing in Canberra a permanent building which can be used by Aborigines as a permanent lobby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Did the Australian delegation to the Stockholm Conference on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, led by the Minister, vote for the moratorium and, 3 weeks later, at the International Whaling Conference held in London, did the Australian delegation, which on that occasion did not include the Minister, abstain from voting on an identical question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Were discussions held between officers of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of National Development on the establishment of a Top End National Park in the Northern Territory; if so, when and where were the discussions held and what decisions resulted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator GREENWOOD- The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That statement also goes on to mention that Labor would guard the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-I present an interim report from the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> on the reference relating to the environmental conditions of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the preservation of their sacred sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to emphasise what the  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has said in the presentation of this report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly one can expect that when those amendments are introduced many people who now occupy places in aged persons homes might be able to return to their own home or to some other suitable place and that the procedure involved under that legislation should enable costs to be reduced and ensure that the elderly citizens of this country have the best of care in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> to which they have been accustomed or which is more suitable for their needs and requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an elderly person is taken right away to another part of the State in which he lives, he is right out of his <span class="highlight">environment</span> and his relatives and friends are unable to visit him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We feel that, because of our strange constitutional situation, the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is not a matter that can be handled without the closest co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the conservationists - of whom there are many associated with our Party, as there are associated with all political parties; it is a growing movement with developing enthusiasm - will be gratified to see the national recognition in this form and the fact that the Commonwealth has now insisted that, in an agreement between the Commonwealth and the Slates for the provision of money to the States for afforestation, there be a requirement that the environmental factors shall be taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will be regarded as a very great advance in the field of the conservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have every reason to expect that this form of words will not be regarded merely as such but that there will be due regard for environmental factors in terms of the amendment, under which the Agreement will provide that the States shall ensure that environmental factors relating to the planting have been considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, we can see a new future in the attitude to the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> consonant with national development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 make this final point: We must recognise that there must always be a coinci dence of the demands of national development and of the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  has stated that he personally is most impressed by the work being done by the Aboriginal medical service in South Sydney, and believes that the Aborigines and non-Aborigines involved are providing a referral or treatment service to numbers of Aborigines in the Sydney metropolitan area who would not at this stage have the necessary confidence to seek treatment in the first instance from the normal community services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator GREENWOOD- The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would also observe for myself - this is not a departmental view but a senator’s view which I have expressed before - that I believe that the issues of quality of life, long term interest in the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, conservation of resources and addition to resources are all very good matters to be considered by the Senate, which I regard as the custodian of the long term interests of the Australian people and their general heritage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The absence of reference to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the originally proposed agreement did not mean that this important field bad been ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Environmental aspects of forestry activities are very much in mind within the Australian Forestry Council which recommended the softwood planting programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>practices’ in clause  9  of the original agreement contemplated recognition of the effects of forestry activities on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has no objection to including in the agreement a form of words that recognises the need to protect the quality of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, all States have a Minister with a specific responsibility for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State Ministers meet with appropriate Commonwealth Ministers regularly as the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Forestry Council, which recommended the softwood programme, has demonstrated a responsible attitude to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by endorsing a Forestry and Wood-based Industries Development Conference to be held in  1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conference will recognise the importance not only of economic matters concerning forests and forest industries but also of social and environmental aspects of forestry and forest industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The council has also established liaison with the newly formed Environmental Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Government has no objection to including in the Agreement a form of words that emphasises the need to protect the quality of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, it would not appear to it to be desirable to dictate a precise procedure for the Forestry Council and the forest services to follow in undertaking a task to which they have diligently addressed themselves in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>House of Representatives and to which I have referred will ensure not only that planting each year is carried out efficiently and in conformity with sound forestry and financial practices but also that environmental factors will have to be considered before plantations are established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for National Development also recommended that similar special references to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> should be considered in any future agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are also informed that the Minister for Conservation for New South Wales had ordered a full environmental study of the Boyd Plateau region which was to be considered before further planting was undertaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, the Colong Committee asked the State Pollution Control Commission to require the Forestry Commission to submit an <span class="highlight">environment</span> impact study on Boyd Plateau. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the whole object of the exercise was to indicate the concern of the Federal Government and of the national Parliament on the question of conservation and the preservation of our natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was to be done by an amendment to this Bill, which provided that if the Commonwealth were to provide moneys, it should be a condition precedent to the availability of those moneys that the environmental factors should be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discussions took place between  Senator Cotton  and myself - he representing  Sir Reginald  Swartz - in which it was pointed out, I think in quite compelling and convincing terms, that if we were to insert the requirement as was proposed and was executed in the amendment requiring an environmental study by an independent expert before a reafforestation programme should proceed in terms of the pending agreement, it would involve a number of things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the States expressed perhaps legitimate concern that this was a trespass not only on their sovereignty but also on their real solicitude and concern for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and consideration of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in any reafforestation programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He pointed to what he regards as specific failures by one of the States to have that regard for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the preservation of natural forest which he would always try to engender. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we must accept the fact that the States are as conscious of the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as is this Parliament; and that they already have taken very many steps in their own field on questions relating to water pollution, and conservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in many areas and in many forms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I think it was not inappropriate that, following the presentation of this Bill and the consideration of it, the Senate should express its insistence and its concern to put on record that it should be a condition precedent to the availability of this money, in terms of the agreement, that the environmental factor, as a matter of agreement and of law, should be considered by State governments which plan to proceed with forestry plantings with money made available under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That will impose on the States the obligation, if this money is to be made available and utilised, that in terms of the agreement they shall be able to assure the Commonwealth that in their forward planning they have considered the environmental factor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government, perhaps for the first time, has taken a strong legislative stand in relation to insistence on respect for and observance of the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I pointed out when speaking originally to this Bill, we members of the Democratic Labor Party have been in the very forefront of the programme for environmental concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one in which some of our members are intensely and personally interested because they serve on various national and State committees dealing with environmental protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the long term, if we developed our own softwoods we might further eliminate damage to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is reported to have said, in words of encouragement to people to build industries in that State, that he would protect them from the environmentalists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Besides that, it is in their interests to see that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is encouraged to the utmost by giving the younger trees a chance to perpetuate forests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said earlier that the proposal that we ure considering was a watered down version of the amendment which we carried originally and that I hoped that it would have enough teeth to ensure that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> was properly protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, this is what I want to know from the Minister - and he is aware that I am now speaking on the Boyd Plateau issue: Should there be a stay of proceedings until February as a result of the outcome of the New South Wales State Government’s feasibility study, whatever it may be, am I to understand that when this Bill is passed today the die will be cast and it will not be impossible in February, if the day is lost by the conservationists - and 1 certainly hope it will not be - for those involved to approach the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  or, conversely to come back to the Minister for National Development  (Sir Reginald Swartz)  for Commonwealth intervention? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators have the acceptance of the general proposition contained in this amendment and they have the statement that the Minister for Conservation in New South Wales intends to make a full environmental impact study before proceeding with his plans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, we have the advantage also of having a Commonwealth Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and the report by the Minister for National Development, which I will not refer to in depth but which gives his observations on the environmental importance of this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The States require not only well trained teachers who are able to impart their knowledge to the children but also the establishment in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the schools themselves of the standards which have been set in Canberra and which should be a yardstick for the standards to which the other States should aspire and which they should seek to maintain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister went on to say that the research will be based on the need to achieve breakthroughs to overcome the underlying problems of soil-plant-animal relationships that are presently reflected in practical farming problems in this <span class="highlight">environment</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When they recovered sufficiently to return to their natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> with their parents, very often it was difficult to be satisfied that they could return with a reasonable expectation of maintaining their recovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This problem is aggravated by a lack of an internationally accepted regulatory framework enabling scheduled services and charters to develop as a viable total transport system, provid ing a stable and orderly <span class="highlight">environment</span> to meet the increasing pressures for mass low cost transportation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am quite sure that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> study to which the honourable senator referred will be known to that committee and through that to any officers of the Department of Civil Aviation who arc concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means that we have regard for the planning of new cities and what part in that scheme of things natural gas will play, lt means that surely we will have regard for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everybody seems to pay lip-service to the importance of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the scheme of things today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it comes within the competence of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  as well as the Minister for National Development to act in relation to these matters, and surely these are matters which the Standing Committee on Industry and Trade should examine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe, as do many of the conservation groups, that the environmental factors have to be considered very seriously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In point of fact, I recall that not so long ago  Senator Byrne  and some of his colleagues were quite vocal on the matter of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the natural habitat, and with the assistance of the Australian Labor Party they were successful in carrying a resolution that the Senate request the Government to have another look at its softwoods legislation because the <span class="highlight">environment</span> was very much affected by it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We wil) take into consideration the matters of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, decentralisation, the economy and the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The costs of acquiring the private property and the public property which must be traversed by the pipeline, the economic consequences of natural gas, the effects upon the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the effects upon the future development of new cities and an active policy of decentralisation are surely all matters which come within the province of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want an investigation into that aspect of laying pipelines anywhere in Australia then the reference should go to the Senate Select Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If inquiries are encouraging, will he have discussions with the respective State Ministers for the introduction of this new method of disposal to further reduce the general pollution of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: What has been done to accelerate the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation’s investigations of the apparent disastrous effects of 1080 poison on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably it is unfortunate in some respects that this legislation has come before us before  1  and my colleagues  Senator Laucke, Senator Keeffe, Senator Webster  and others have been able to complete our deliberations as members of the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> which is considering the problems of Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To illustrate the substantial provisions made by the Commonwealth since the 1967 referendum the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  prepared a table which he subsequently had incorporated in Hansard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot be doubted that in a number of cases of the admission of elderly patients to nursing homes it would be of social and medical advantage to *.hem if they could remain in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the private home with relatives able to look after them provided the professional nursing care needed is available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The stresses and strains of growth are having an impact on the living conditions and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the entire Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I explained to the Senate when introducing the Aged Persons Homes Bill recently, one of the most important aspects of this year’s comprehensive programme to improve the health and welfare of aged people is to encourage and assist people who might otherwise be admitted prematurely or unnecessarily to nursing homes or other similar institutions to remain in their domestic <span class="highlight">environment</span> for as long as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we have asked the Commonwealth Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts to initiate a royal commission into the conditions at that reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a while the scheme worked fairly well, but I must say that under the present Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have survived in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which possibly no other people, including ourselves, would have survived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without those things they can never cross the enormous chasm that exists between the type of life their <span class="highlight">environment</span> forced upon them and the type of life that we have been able to develop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, my Party does not think that this is possible and, secondly, we do not think it desirable that they should leave everything behind them that they have learned in order to survive in the type of <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they have survived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>True it is that their <span class="highlight">environment</span> has caused our Aborigines to have a skin pigmentation different from that which some may think is desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that the pigmentation in my skin is quite adequate for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which I live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever they are, they managed to survive, to their great credit, in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which I am certain that our own race of people would not have survived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view, they are repeating jargon and a slogan that has been sold to them by other people who are trying to make political capital out of people who have been handicapped for so many years by their <span class="highlight">environment</span> and who. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody who has fairly considered the history of this country could say that the Australian Aborigines, any more than the animal species of this disappearing continent before the white man came, would have survived through to this generation had it not been for the intervention of the white people, bringing the knowledge and skills of Europe with them which enabled them to tackle the deteriorating <span class="highlight">environment</span> of this country and make it what it is today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> unaltered by the skills of the settlers who had come from Europe, they were to a large extent, over the centuries, deteriorating in numbers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the infusion of farming skills that overcame the drought seasons which periodically blasted this country before there was any control of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That served them well in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they lived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As they develop into a different type of society in a different type of <span class="highlight">environment</span> they do not want to bring with them all the old cultures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal culture gives him rights over a 17-year-old girl who is living in a different <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 would not be as clean as he is and I would not be living at his standard if I had had to live in his <span class="highlight">environment</span> all my life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Boys having to prove themselves before they are men and some of the physical things which girls are forced to go through as part of tribal rites are things which, if we leave the Aborigines alone, they will not try to bring with them across the bridge from the <span class="highlight">environment</span> which they once knew to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which it is inevitable that they must some day live, unless the fools in the Opposition force them to do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were the sort of things which helped to sustain them in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they were forced to extract a living - which they did - and which would have caused many other races and many other nationalities to disappear from the face of the earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great number of social workers are employed helping the Aborigines to understand the difference between living in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> that they are used to and transferring to a certain type of house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the houses themselves have not blended sufficiently the <span class="highlight">environment</span> that the people who are now living in them are used to with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> to which we hope they will aspire - an <span class="highlight">environment</span> which is similar to our own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who makes even a cursory examination of the circumstances in which this problem has emerged will find in the process that the greatest responsibility in relation to this aspect of the problem goes back to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from which these people come, their habits, the requirements of that <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and the circumstances in which they had to learn to survive in that <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those circumstances, that way of life, can be totally destructive if applied to our type of <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that <span class="highlight">environment</span> the children and the infants were regularly breast fed until they were 4 or 5 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we can understand now from our knowledge of nutrition, in the new <span class="highlight">environment</span> the children gradually have been lacking the nourishment that was required to sustain them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now they are in settlements where the mothers have no responsibility in this regard because they too are products of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, habits and circumstances forced upon them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably similar statistics have never been collated before in the history of mankind, namely, statistics relating to people so recently emerged from a primitive <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I concede - this was stated in the second reading speech, and the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  has conceded this - that this is a small number, but it represents a distinct improvement in the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With that background I was very interested to read a Press statement issued last Friday by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  in which he announced that 2 Sydney journalists would receive the first Commonwealth Government awards for critical writing stimulating interest in and knowledge of the arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Council for the Arts, I am informed, made the recommendation some months ago but the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts sat on the recommendation for months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A group comprising representatives of Primary Industry, Fisheries Division, CSIRO Applied Chemistry, CSIRO Fisheries and Oceanography, Departments of National Development, Navy, and <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, as well as a representative of the oil industry has been established to advise on materials and equipment to be stockpiled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the second occasion on which the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has reported on a matter originally brought to the Senate by way of petition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole question raised in this petition is naturally of interest to a Committee with environmental responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all the circumstances, the judgment of the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is that duplication of the inquiry already held would be a superfluous and unproductive exercise and that the matter is best left to the determination of the Parliament in accordance with its view of the report of the joint Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite untrue, as some people claim, that the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> would have been duplicating the functions of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While I do not think that in Australia we have reached this degree of application of nitrogenous fertiliser - I trust that we will not -I hope that every user of this fertiliser will have some concern for the ecology and <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they live and try to balance out the capacity of the good earth to absorb these residues of nitrogenous fertiliser and not continue with their application for application’s sake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the  Chairman  of Senate Estimates Committee B, I want to make a further reference for the sake of the Hansard record, as I did during the hearings of the Committee, to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> section of the estimates which we are discussing at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister  representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts whether his attention has been drawn to statements by the DirectorGeneral of the Port of London Authority,  Mr John  Lunch, referring to the factual and quite magnificent results of that Authority in cleaning up the pollution of the River Thames. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have indicated to  Mr O’Donnell  that the matter is under my consideration and it is also under the consideration of my colleague, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts,  Mr Howson,  because he administers, for example, the Commonwealth Literary Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So many words have ‘been written about a Jack of co-ordination, a lack of foresight, hindsight and planning that I am sure many people have come to recognise that our <span class="highlight">environment</span> is not planned despite the efforts of many wellmeaning public officials in the State and local spheres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our social services, our living standards and our <span class="highlight">environment</span> have all been pushed aside by this Government and by its predecessors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true, having regard to the state of health of the mother or the state of home and tensions, that some children would benefit from the tensionfree <span class="highlight">environment</span> which they would probably find in a child care centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The consequence of the present proposals will be to further strengthen those existing centres which at present have a very strong ‘ghetto’ <span class="highlight">environment</span> in them, to encourage the establishment of new centres of a similar kind, and to maintain this ghetto’ approach at least until the Commonwealthassisted centres have taken over virtually the whole child care field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As you know,  Mr President,  the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is currently investigating the social problems of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the preservation of their sacred sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not many weeks ago the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> was investigating the housing conditions of people of the Northern Territory and a senior social worker who had his heart in the right place decided that there were a couple of people who needed to be returned to a reserve so that they would be able to talk to members of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the environmental impact statement on the proposal to build on Black Mountain, Canberra, a tower for the Postmaster-General’s Department contains expenditure figures which do not coincide with those given when the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> visited the site with PMG officers, can we have an early breakdown of the figures which appear to indicate a considerable difference in the attitudes adopted by the 2 departments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer particularly to the reported statement of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation that he is powerless to act in any matters of conservation and that the Federal Government had no constitutional power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister examine this aspect of the report in the light of the reported statement of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation and advise the Senate whether he agrees with this conclusion reached by an allParty committee of the Senate and, if not, will he give the Senate the reasons for the decision? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, as chemical processes can create environmental problems, what steps are being taken to make sure that there will be minimal pollution of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has reached the point where it understands that it cannot go on indefinitely expanding its industry and trade at the price of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, its people, pollution, urban overcrowding and urban under-development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some aspects of the operations of those stations will not be revealed to members of the Parliament - there are some things which cannot be told to members of the Parliament - but at least members of the Parliament will be able to visit the areas, will know the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and will be better equipped to debate matters concerning them in the Parliament and to say whether in their opinion co-operation between Australia and the United States in those areas is a good idea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A large number of persons in the community are unable to work, owing to some physical or mental disability in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> which our society has built, and we shall have to overcome this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If not, will the Department seek to do so to ensure that matters impinging on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are not disregarded? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask finally: Can the Senate have an assurance from the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation that he will strenuously oppose any move to place an airport in the national park south of Sydney, or at Duffy’s Forest, which would encroach upon Kuring-Gat Park? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation has been established, all Federal projects will be subjected to an environmental impact study prior to Cabinet’s approval for the work to be undertaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I assure the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate that an environmental investigation will be made of any site recommended and that the report of the investigation will have a big influence on whether the site is accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-97-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator CAVANAGH - The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-97-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had a conversation with the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation about the financing of water supplies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does his Department make a study of environmental matters when considering a Commonwealth project? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the establishment of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation and its proper interest in the environmental impact of Commonwealth public works, which possibly could cause some delay in future Commonwealth projects, what is the Government or the Minister doing to ensure that the future program of works is not delayed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From time to time the Department of Works has had interdepartmental committees do environmental studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On occasions it has been concerned with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> when the erection of buildings or the building of roads, etc., was under examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the present Government there is a Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation which makes environmental impact studies on all proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The occasion to which the honourable senator referred was one when an environmental study was made after the Department had proceeded with plans and the calling of tenders in relation to the communications tower on Black Mountain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Environmental studies will be made before there is any definite move in relation to any project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Identification and acceptance of an airport site as part of a regional plan for that area is at least 2 years away, partly because of completing of <span class="highlight">environment</span>, conservation and regional planning aspects and partly because of a need to test in depth the air safety acceptability and airport engineering feasibility of the ultimately agreed short list of possible airport sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator CAVANAGH- The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation aware that the Minister for Country Water Supplies in Western Australia has stated that he has not received from the Commonwealth Government a reply to his request for further Commonwealth finance in extending the comprehensive water supply scheme in that State? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-82-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I undertook to take up with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation whether such a letter had been received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-82-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation replied to the letter on 3rd April. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-82-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concerning the Black Mountain Telecommunications Tower, which was the subject of a minority report by  Senator Mulvihill  and  Senator Keeffe,  a paper has been presented to the Cabinet by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation and also by the PostmasterGeneral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation answered a question I had asked him on 29th March concerning extra Commonwealth funds for extending the Comprehensive Water Supply Scheme in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was brought home very strongly and deeply to me and my fellow honourable senators who were members of the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> before the Committee’s reconstitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It inquired into the environmental conditions of Aborigines and Torres Strait islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our Aborigines have been forced to live in a primitive <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To survive in that <span class="highlight">environment</span> they must condition themselves Jo their circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To try to make Aborigines move from that way of life and live in our present day <span class="highlight">environment</span> would be to court disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one area in which Aborigines have not been able to keep pace with us, not because they could not do so but because the circumstances of their <span class="highlight">environment</span> made it imprudent that they should even try. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These problems stem not from the <span class="highlight">environment</span> to which they have become accustomed but from association with the ideas and standards by which the present society has learned to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A close study of Aborigines in their simple <span class="highlight">environment</span> reveals that they had excellent methods, for example, of maintaining family levels at a standard which was commensurate with their <span class="highlight">environment</span> and which enabled them to survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am mentioning now only one of the problems with which these people, in such a primitive <span class="highlight">environment</span>, must learn to live as they feel the impact of modern society on their lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we have a new department - the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation - which is working actively in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accidents often have multiple causes including the humans involved, the vehicles they drive or rode, the roadway systems and the overall <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which the other three elements interact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation say whether it is still proposed to carry on with the abortive inquiry into the Gordon River power scheme in Tasmania, which is almost completed, when  Mr Reece  says that the inquiry is humiliating to him and in fact has demanded curbs on the inquiry, which has been refused by  Dr Cass? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">environment</span> study that is under way is a new proposal, but it will have very little effect upon schemes which have been commenced and are at an advanced stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been discussions between the Premier of Tasmania, the Prime Minister and the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation on the question of studies in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main thing that the Commonwealth wants to do - realising that it cannot stop schemes that have been commenced - is to see that developments which have taken place to the detriment of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> will not occur again without firstly an <span class="highlight">environment</span> impact study being undertaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For that purpose an Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> committee has been established comprising representatives from the State and Federal spheres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In February 1973, the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  requested the Australian Academy of Science to report to him on the actual or potential harm to Australia, including its human and animal population, its resources and <span class="highlight">environment</span>, from the explosion of nuclear devices in the atmosphere, under water, or on or near the surface of the earth, with particular regard to the past and prospective explosions by France in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Postmaster-Genera) supply  to the Senate the  reasons  why  telephone installationsin the PrestonReservoir areas  of  Melbourne  are  being changed from underground lead-ins toprivate property to the overhead wiring variety, in view ofthe modern practice of preserving our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the ghastly distortion of our surroundings occasioned by overhead electric and telephone poles and wiring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If not, beyond the consideration of rotational and atmospheric movement influences to which the AttorneyGeneral has already referred, on what grounds does he claim that the Chinese explosions are not as detrimental to the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> as the French explosions are? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular, we will regulate exploration, development, transportation, marketing and use of oil, natural gas and all related hydrocarbons We will also prevent the pollution of the ecology and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by fuel extraction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In conjunction with this we have in the world today a situation in which great numbers of people are growing up in areas of combat and areas in which physical conflict involving life or death has been part of the normal social <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst the Department is appreciative of the desirability, of preserving the living environments from unsightly aerial construction,the erection of comparatively light unobtrusive telephone leads on existing power routes does littleto add to the disfigurement of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation noticed a statement attributed to the New South Wales Minister for Environmental Control,  Mr Beale,  calling for a national pollution monitoring network? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If not, will the Minister arrange with his colleague in another place to call a meeting of State ministers concerned with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> with the object of discussing ways and means by which such a network could be established? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation has received any correspondence from the New South Wales Government on this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe that a conference is to be held which will be attended by representatives from the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and representatives of the States, lt will deal with the whole question of pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government cease the practice of transferring government departments to this hostile <span class="highlight">environment</span> or at least pay danger money if it does not? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a greater awareness these days of the need for conservation of our resources and preservation of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and there is much more urgency to find and adopt suitable methods to prevent or control pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Particular attention will be directed towards ensuring the conservation and preservation of our natural resources and of the marine and associated environments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need for such a title is particularly important in the search for minerals in a relatively new and unknown <span class="highlight">environment</span>, lt will enable operators to carry  out  the necessary preliminary surveys and testing of techniques before deciding whether an area is worth an application for an exclusive exploration title - a permit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our main aim will continue to be that this legislation shall encourage efficient and adequate exploration and exploitation of our offshore resources and at the same time control operations in such a way as to ensure the conservation of our natural resources and the preservation of our marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> to the common good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that we regret that the Australian Labor Party has created in this country an <span class="highlight">environment</span> and a climate of opinion in which a need is felt to repeal this provision in order to allay apprehension and fears. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Postmaster-General, in view of the modern trendto preserve all aspects of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, inform the Senate as to why underground connecting wires for telephone installations in homes in some northern suburbs of Melbourne are being replaced with unsightly overhead connections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Department is appreciative  of  the desirability  of  preserving the living environments from unsightly aerial construction, the erection  of  comparatively light unobtrusive telephone leads  on  existing power routes does little to add  to  the disfigurement  of  the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation has officially advised me that no decision has yet been made as to the fees to be paid to the members of the committee of inquiry into Lake Pedder, whose report is expected to be available at the end of July, can the Minister advise me on what principles this open-ended contract for services will be decided? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator next referred to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to the damage that was likely to be caused to it by a public authority such as the one suggested in the legislation when constructing pipelines from point A to point B. I would invite the honourable senator to visit Queensland at any time he likes to see what has happened there under private enterprise so far as damage to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can go a little further up the north coast and see the same type of operators similarly damaging the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the possibility of damage being caused to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by a public authority is much less than it would be if the same project was undertaken by private enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A difference of opinion has arisen as to whether such action would be a threat to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need for us to watch the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of this country is great. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once all knowledge on a proposal has been examined, a determination must be made on whether to proceed with the project and whether to cross the fine line beyond which that project may become a threat to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That should be the case whether those who wish to interfere with a project are private individuals, people who have banded together to form a society to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> or people who have banded together to protect the wages and influence of those who work in a specific industry - and I refer there to a trade union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such people may obtain information from another source that the Parliament has not examined a proposition and that a project still is a threat to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be under supervision to ensure the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> to the fullest possible extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that because [ know that the people of New South Wales irrespective of party labels have been concerned about pipelines and their effect on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the vision splendid that I can see appearing if we achieve a meshing of all the hopes and aspirations of  Mr Connor  aided and abetted by  Dr Moss  Cass, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sincerely believe that whether it be a State enterprise or a private business enterprise a levy must be imposed to protect not so much natural resources as the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> so that people can at least experience the good aspects of the Australian continent and sec that they are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make a comparison of the minimum damage done to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in a project of the magnitude of that undertaken by the Snowy Mountains Authority and consider also the sick and sorry record of some of the beach mining undertaken in Queensland and New South Wales, we can see that, with some notable exceptions, unfettered private enterprise operations are a pretty poor show. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only by having a Government authority such as the Pipeline Authority will we find that big establishments, such as the oil companies or the Australian Gaslight Co., which create inroads into the <span class="highlight">environment</span> will look to their laurels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Representatives of departments concerned with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> throughout Australia have met and tried to get Australia-wide agreement on proposals for controlling the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council, which again meets in July, has an extensive program for consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are the environmental factors which are so dear to the hearts of many senators, particularly some senators opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is likely to be affected, we all know that governments, whatever political complexion they may be, have the idea of getting a job done, and they disregard or ride roughshod over the complaints, the views and the statements of people who are interested in the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not suggesting that the complaints or the arguments of those who have even an obsessed view in relation to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> should be paramount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the natural history of public authorities which have no responsibility to the people is to ignore or to ride roughshod over the views of those who seek to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, whereas Parliament, which is more subject to pressures and more subject to the views of the people, would be inclined to listen to these complaints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same remarks apply to the comments regarding the environmental matter which was referred to earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Government’s position on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and environmental aspects is quite clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is our intention to ensure that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in all these measures which are taken by the Government is properly protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Works in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Urban and Regional Development or Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do know that it has been examined and in fact is still under examination by the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the continuing introduction of sophisticated highperformance jet aircraft into service with the domestic airlines and Qantas Airways Ltd and the far-reaching consequences that the introduction of such aircraft will have on safety, the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and unemployment, and in the interests of open government, will the Minister take steps to have this important report released for public examination or at least made available for perusal by members of the Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>environmental aspects of legislative and administrative measures which ought to be taken in order to ensure the wise and effective management of the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> and of Australia’s natural resources and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>such other matters relating to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation and the management of Australia’s natural resources as are referred to it by- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, or <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But with deference to  Senator Withers  and his colleagues, they should be appreciative of the fact that we have a Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> with my colleague,  Senator Keeffe,  as  Chairman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I strongly argue that no matter what Party one represents here, conservationists in the Senate have a place on this committee on <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent years there has been a growing awareness of the need for careful planning of centres of population and for real consideration to be given to the protection of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But how wrong this proved to be when inquiries into our <span class="highlight">environment</span> were really made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the new awareness of the need for a better <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which to live and for an avoidance of overconcentrations of population will continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we set out through this legislation to develop more cities of the Melbourne or Sydney type and have no concern for the effect that such cities may have on surrounding areas and their <span class="highlight">environment</span>, we may only compound the problems that we face already rather than achieve what I believe the Government is honestly setting out to achieve by the introduction of this measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is to the inhuman <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the cities around which this Bill develops and to which attention is now being given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But one of the matters to which  His Excellency  referred was the matter of environmental research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the new Commission will undertake environmental research, and I hope that it will draw upon the results of research which is being undertaken by a large number of commissions and committees related to other departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the inexpert committee which the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  has started travelling to inquire into the Lake Pedder project in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Criticism of this matter has been voiced because of its impact upon the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have brought into the Senate 6 photographs which will illustrate the reflections of the new lake and which, I hope, will attract the interest of honourable senators and others to what is called now the destruction of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the hydro-electric development there is a magnificent project showing how, by prudent management, man can improve the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, greatly enhance the human enjoyment of the area and contribute to the quality of life in an unsurpassed manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then I come to the king hit by which I am greatly convinced that  Dr Cass  is displaying the responsibility of a prudent Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation when he is asking us to spend money on an inquiry into a project on which $43m has been committed out of a total, I believe, of nearly $107m, and tries to criticise a scheme that has been so adequately canvassed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But before doing that, I think that I would be singularly remiss in my duties if I did not reply to the scornful attack which  Senator Wright  made on the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One classic illustration of the utilisation of the mobile work force came to light when I was in northern Australia last year with my colleague,  Senator Keeffe,  on the Senate Select Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope the Qantas management is not gulled by cries about the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to balance our environmental factors and our utility factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that Qantas is not pressured by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Dr Cass)  into not accepting the Concorde, because I think it is needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another matter I wish to mention concerns the ridicule of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  whom I represent in this chamber, in the most offensive terms that the abundant vocabulary of the eloquent senator from Tasmania could supply, by expressing his fascination for 2 little worms in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of our citizens throughout Australia prefer the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the little lake with the animal life that assembles there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not saying that this is right but there is a growing section of the community - it is now a large section - which is for preserving the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and not sacrificing it, as  Senator Mulvihill  has said, for commercial achievements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the environmental consciousness of the people today we must get a system for justifying our advances on every occasion when man destroys the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> of some description. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been to Black Mountain and I do not think that the preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is a consideration which should stop the building of the tower. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The agitation now is not about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> but about my Department forgetting to put an extra staircase into the tower to meet fire prevention requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have to convince them that we are taking action not to destroy their <span class="highlight">environment</span> but for the, advancement of our way of life in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the initial agreement the Commonwealth wished to impose certain restrictions in relation to environmental matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the new Commonwealth Government is not particularly concerned about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and because the regard which it has for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is only a matter of window dressing and flag waving, the Minister gave way in relation to that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason the then Prime Minister made that statement on behalf of the Government was that the Government believed that the stresses and strains of growth were having an impact on the living conditions and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the entire Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The French Government, in seeking to find reassurance for its radio-active contamination of man and his <span class="highlight">environment</span>, in the dose limits for critical groups of the public recommended by ICRP, might also have noted the following comment in the same publication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The elements in question are peculiarly the result of nuclear testing and it seems that more and more is becoming known about the dangers of these and their effect upon the <span class="highlight">environment</span> generally and the human body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So traditionally the social worker is committed to helping people adapt to their particular problems and to the social <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they find themselves and generally to understand the norms and the quality of life of individuals, families and groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there can be a temptation for people such as these to be more concerned about other matters in the social <span class="highlight">environment</span> than involving themselves in providing a helpful service for the needy and for those socially disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In recent times metropolitan councils on the northern side of Sydney have taken the extraordinary but desirable step of stopping the movement of traffic along certain streets to try to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the local residents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a number of local authorities were seeking finance for the conservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> or the elimination of pollution related to a stream running through their areas they might well be considered as a regional organisation much more efficiently equipped to handle that situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the public interest is the justification for the growing concern and Government action which are designed to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from pollution and to maintain and preserve the desirable features of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer in the first instance to the statement made by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation in connection with World <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Day and I note particularly his mention of a national water policy in co-operation with the States, which would deal with water resources, water quality and water pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen the reference to World <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> I went into this question extensively by speaking to people in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that, in the light of the fact that the Australian Labor Party is introducing great changes, is introducing new departments to deal with the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, tourism and other matters, and is extending the area of government operations a great deal, the increases she mentioned were quite moderate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the change of government, on 31 October 1972 the Departments of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Treasury, Works and <span class="highlight">Environment</span> were asked to seek the concurrence of the then Prime Minister and their respective Ministers to the acquisition of the 32 square miles of freehold land concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They represent failures in a complex transport system involving the vehicle, the road, the driver and his social <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My first question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister inform the Senate how sincere the Government is in its determination to preserve the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> in areas under its control? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been advised by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation in the following terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consideration of these matters is also  a  function of the Australian Water Resources Council, through its Technical Committee on Water Quality and also of the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council through its Monitoring Sub-Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that, by arrangement with  Mr President,  it has been agreed that daily Hansards will be provided for, I think, the Joint Committee on Prices  and  the House  of  Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has as part of its charter a continuing oversight of the problems of pollution and the preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We and our advisers do not at present foresee any deterioration in our strategic <span class="highlight">environment</span> that would involve consideration of the commitment of our defence force to military operations to protect Australia’s security or strategic interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The favourable developments in the strategic <span class="highlight">environment</span> that I have outlined strongly support our view that Australia is unlikely to come under strategic pressure or military threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The naval component has the type of units which contribute - especially in conjunction with maritime patrol aircraft and aircraft providing strike attack and defence - to meeting the appropriate fundamental requirements for the protection of Australia and its immediate <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could, in the present strategic <span class="highlight">environment</span>, deter to a great extent any minor harassment and interference with Australian sovereign control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In actual fact that money is for grubbing orchards out and destroying in a day when the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is supposed to be one factor considered as well as economics the lovely orchard country that has been built up by hard work for 50 years in many cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Committee recognises that capital assets such as good grounds and buildings provide an enriching <span class="highlight">environment</span> for education, it is obvious that it is becoming increasingly difficult even for the most affluent schools to service such debts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that is because we pay more regard now to the impact on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of many projects contemplated by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also have the situation that as from 1 July environmental impact studies have to be presented in relation to all projects, which means that a closer examination has to be undertaken by the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was at one stage suggested that the Committee should also carry out the actual environmental impact studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the environmental impact studies should be taken up at a different level from that of the inspection and examination of projects by the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that many projects have to be examined in depth because of the new factor of their impact on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After hearing evidence from various departments and the representatives of various organisations in Western Australia - yacht clubs, <span class="highlight">environment</span> organisations, bush walkers and others - the Committee was able to reach a decision, with the co-operation of the Department of the Navy, whereby three-quarters of that lovely Island would still remain available for public use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to set up a body at high level of professional people and include in it, as  Senator Poyser  suggested, people expert in relation to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be persons with some knowledge of and ability in regard to environmental factors, for instance engineers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Poyser  mentioned, when a large public work is undertaken or a public building is erected in any city, or in any area for that matter, studies of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and many other aspects have to be coordinated with the proposed construction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Works costing less than $lm are considered by the Minister for Works  (Senator Cavanagh)  and the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  and, there again, either one of those Ministers could call in - and undoubtedly would call in - the Minister representing the <span class="highlight">environment</span> portfolio which has been set up or the Minister representing the urban development portfolio which has been set up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So although technically, if a small amount of money is involved, it will be a matter for the Minister for Works and the Treasurer, the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  and the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  are increasingly being brought into these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It immediately moved up departments, as we han seen, such as the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say that this matter falls within the responsibility of my colleague,  Senator Cavanagh,  in his capacity as the Minister representing the Minister responsible for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and water resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have established a new Department of Conservation and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a Department of Urban and Regional Development where all the decisions which have been taken for transport and other matters have been considered, and where even  this very matter of the airport has been very carefully considered in conjunction with the requirements of wise conservation and environmental approaches as developed by  Mr Uren,  the Minister in charge of that Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On every hand the Government has been trying to overcome neglect and, incidentally, to pay attention to the reports of this Senate on environmental matters such as water and air pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are subjected to added burdens of work due to environmental matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find that more and more people come before us to put their points of view on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as it relates to certain projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation be drawn to an article written by Owen McKenna and published in last week’s Melbourne ‘Truth’ in which it is claimed that the $64m Dartmouth Dam project has become a ‘circus of bungling and money wastage’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Yes, I have seen the article and I have discussed it with the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation has every confidence that the constructing authority is a capable department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Australian Labor Party Government established the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation did it give the people of Australia an assurance that each of the major capital works would be preceded by an environmental impact study? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will the Minister lay on the table of the Senate a study by the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation relating to the development of the Galston airport? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that aspect would probably come more within the scope of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Budget $3m is set aside so that people like the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation,  Dr Cass,  and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development, Tom Uren, can collaborate with people who want to preserve the best of the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The actions of Australian citizens or organisations in protesting against the carrying out by the French Government of atmospheric nuclear tests in the Pacific have to be understood in the light of the open disregard by France of the ruling of the International Court of Justice and the relative effects on the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> of fall-out from French and Chinese tests (see the answer given in the Senate on IS May 1973 to Question No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government had announced that such projects are subject to feasibility studies and environmental impact studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He also will find it in statements made repeatedly by the Prime Minister and by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I answer this question in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, who is responsible for water resources in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Works who represents the Minister for Transport in this chamber whether he noticed an article in this morning’s Press which stated that  Dr Cass,  the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, had said that all international air travellers should use the Tullamarine Airport at Melbourne and domestic travellers should use the Sydney Airport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel too that the Senate should give some consideration to referring the matter for investigation to the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, under the chairmanship of  Senator Keeffe  who is a Queenslander and who knows what is going on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These two substances remain radioactive and remain in the immediate human <span class="highlight">environment</span> for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The French nuclear explosions to date have added comparatively little carbon-14 to the human <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1972 the Second International Parliamentary Conference on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> was held in Vienna, in Austria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basis of our claim is that the French are committing a nuisance in our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and we are hoping that the International Court of Justice will take steps to restrain that nuisance; to enjoin the French from committing it- the same way as can happen between neighbours - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">environment</span> applies only to Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, refers to page 257 of the Hawkesbury River Valley environmental study background report which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Galston-Dural area is within the catchment area mentioned, can the Senate be assured that the report is brought to the attention of the Commonwealth Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation so that he might give full consideration to the matters dealt with as they affect his portfolio? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable senators I present a copy of the Interim Report of the Lake Pedder Committee of Inquiry together with an engineering review which was prepared at the request of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation by the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is something which I know the people of Australia will not deny, because so many people can point to their own increase in standards and prosperity which could have come about only in the type of <span class="highlight">environment</span> which the previous Government created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is part of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which some action has to be taken and in which, as I stress because it is the purpose of debating this matter of urgency, the Government has shown that it is quite reluctant to do anything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have achieved what we set out to do in that we have created an <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which over-award payments are depressed’, he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My question to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs concerns the matter which was raised by  Senator McManus,  that is, the enforced displacement of a 7-year-old Aboriginal girl from the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which she was raised by foster parents in Darwin to a life completely foreign to her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a question of the girl being taken into a strange <span class="highlight">environment</span> for some ulterior motive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, why does not the Minister await the outcome of this hearing and avoid the possibility of unnecessarily damaging the <span class="highlight">environment</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of the environmental impact or consequences of the Concorde is now occupying the attention of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that before any final commitment is made we will have that report before us in order to see whether there are any environmental dangers in connection with these flights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We and our advisers do not at present foresee any deterioration in our strategic <span class="highlight">environment</span> that would involve consideration of the commitment of our defence force to military operations to protect Australia’s security or strategic interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first of the 3 main provisions of the Bill relates to the financial assistance provided by the Australian Government for home care service scheme- in other words, housekeeper and other domestic assistance which helps to keep aged people in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of their own homes for as long as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the matter is really one which concerns the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next, he expressed doubts about the ecological aspects of the scheme and referred the matter to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  and to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That action subsequently was supported by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation which referred the matter to the AuditorGeneral who is at present carrying out an investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the Minister took the necessary steps to refer these matters to the various people to whom they should have been referred- to the Attorney-General and subsequently to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation and to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation- a campaign was started against him which I regret was responsible in a great part for his transfer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that the whole of this project was referred for scrutiny to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a private letter from  Mr Dexter  to members of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs as to the evidence that they would be giving before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The control of the use of insecticides and the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from the over-use of such chemicals are really the responsibility of the State governments, not the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The experience of the New South Wales authorities is that the use of these chemicals in the past has not created any environmental problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Can the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation confirm the announcement appearing in today’s Press that the Federal Government has approved a new national water resources policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the report of the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution has been under continuous consideration by the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation,  Dr Cass,  will be making a statement on the water policy of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third aspect was the control of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> against pollution and to ensure development is in keeping with modern urban standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as providing handicapped people with the opportunity to augment their pension income, sheltered workshops provide a social <span class="highlight">environment</span>; a place away from the home or hostel with which they can identify; where they can make friends and feel that they have a purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Tonight I request  Senator Cavanagh,  as Minister representing the Minister for Conservation and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Dr Cass,  to ask  Dr Cass  to confer with the Queensland Premier on a very important conservation matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  in the Senate, I will see that the matter is referred to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation whether I am correct in recollecting that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation constituted a committee to examine the question of draining Lake Pedder and removing construction work there? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that there is an honourable senator in this chamber who would not acknowledge that  Senator Mulvihill  has acquired or made for himself a reputation in areas of conservation and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, basically because he has used the adjourment debate as a forum in which to express his views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This new lake provides a beautiful <span class="highlight">environment</span> that far surpasses anything that was in the old lake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time that especially the mainland Press of Australia knew a few of the basic facts with regard to this insane delusion that by draining the new Lake Pedder the <span class="highlight">environment</span> will be improved while a lake of infinite beauty and with a terrific expanse of 93 square miles- as against 10 square miles of the old lake- will be destroyed, and the economic development of hydro-electric power in Tasmania will be impeded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say a few words on both of the matters that have been raised because one comes under my portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs and the other comes under the portfolio of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  whom I represent in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, before the last election the honourable member for Reid  (Mr Uren)  who was speaking in Tasmania with the authority of the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said that if a Labor government gained office it was his view that he would be the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, and he gave an assurance to the people of Tasmania that a feasibility study would be carried out on the restoration of Lake Pedder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an acknowledgement of responsibility to the wave of environmentalists who are so very concerned about the question of Lake Pedder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Transport has this matter continually under review, as has the Department for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is already conducting an intensive inquiry into the environmental conditions of Aborigines and that the reference to that Committee includes the matters to which he has referred? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He gave evidence in camera before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be fallacious to think that the attempts to establish for these people- for themselves and in their own right- business ventures which would provide an opportunity to enter into the type of <span class="highlight">environment</span> which we have would be successful from the beginning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, will the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation preserve his usual masterly neutrality on this supremely important environmental matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, he pointed out that because of what was happening and because no one else was taking action he considered- and I am speaking in regard to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>- that there ought to be bodies with appropriate functions which could give proper advice and which would have authority to stop the erection of buildings which would destroy the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and stop the destruction of those buildings which were part of our history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What has been done by  Mr Mundey  and by the trade union has occurred because of the default of the New South Wales Government to attend properly to matters of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps what Israel has done, as  Senator Wheeldon  rightly said, was not done with complete justice to everybody concerned, but it is an established fact today that Israel has created a miracle in an area of the world where people had to grub from the hostile <span class="highlight">environment</span> only the barest necessities of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-The Australian Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation has not done any work in the area of pollution caused by petro-chemical industries but is aware of this danger and is seeking a report from the Director of the South Australian Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation who recently has been overseas studying this question, particularly the pollution control methods of such plants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The test is whether we have achieved in this world an atmosphere or an <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which by our actions our own country is more secure and more free and we are living in an atmosphere in our region in which there is stability and freedom and we are respected for the views we hold and because we are willing to stand up for the other fellow and his right to be different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-I .fer the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation to a report which appeared in a recent edition of the Melbourne ‘Age’ which claims that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation and the Minister for Minerals and Energy are on a collision course over the proposal to establish a uranium enrichment plant in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the rest of the question referred to an environmental impact study I suggest that I am the appropriate Minister to answer it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Government’s environmental impact policy an environmental impact statement must be made on all occasions when it is necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The impact statement is made by the sponsoring department and not of necessity by the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sponsoring department must proceed with an impact statement for any project which may have a detrimental effect upon the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Persons suffering from psychiatric and similar problems return to coping normally much more quickly when treated in their usual community <span class="highlight">environment</span>, with their families and friends around them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general purpose of social policy- which encompasses such areas as education, housing, health services, employment policies and other matters, as well as the more specific issues of income-security payments and personal welfare services- is to provide an <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which the individual is given the opportunity to develop his or her personal abilities to thenmaximum potential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Special provisions must often be developed for particular individuals or groups of people who are in need of particular assistance to enable them to cope with inherited or environmentally induced disadvantages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Involved in the whole <span class="highlight">environment</span> of our senior people is the matter of their retirement and what they do on their retirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the social problems with which all of us have had some association is the situation whereby senior citizens have to be moved from their own <span class="highlight">environment</span> with which they have become familiar for a long time into another <span class="highlight">environment</span> which might provide security and a whole lot of other social advantages but which is not the area in which these people have grown up and with which they have been long associated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that there are people who are prepared to put up with discomforts and disadvantages so that they can stay in this <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But a judgment has to be made in regard to whether or not a person should be moved into an <span class="highlight">environment</span> which is more secure but which does not have the same kind of relationship to which I have just referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interestingly enough, a significant number of people concerned in this study were described as those who used immigration to Australia to try to escape personal and <span class="highlight">environment</span> problems at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether the remedy in the Australian Capital Territory falls within the responsibility of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we have to give serious consideration to whether penalising people is the solution to this problem or whether the solution lies in educating people to take a pride in their <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the increasing amount of unbiodegradable insecticides, weedicides and other offensive effluents that are finding their way into the rivers and the seas throughout and around the nation would the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation introduce a system of periodic warnings through the Australian Broadcasting Commission of pollution levels as a service to the public similar to weather reports? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation will make money available to the States on any occasion where it can assist by such a grant in stopping the pollution which is taking place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should there be legislative enactment of this Parliament to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> in particular, and, as  Senator Lawrie  said, the air above the sea and the soil below the seabed, it will mean that there will be resistance, Queensland leading the way, from those areas in which there is a vested interest in what might be extracted from the sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are other aspects, particularly in relation to the preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quote paragraph 13.2 of the introduction dealing with conservation and the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was emphasised by the Premier and others on his behalf that no damage had been done to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>) the present form of the scheme would permit and ensure sufficiently concerted Commonwealth and State action to have blowouts stopped; to contain effectively and subsequently to clean up any spillage, which did occur, with the least possible damage to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and with the greatest expedition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that, when the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, the honourable Moss Cass, recently announced that the Australian Government had decided to sign the Convention, he foreshadowed amendments to Customs legislation to prohibit international trade in those species covered by the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation the increase is only in salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sum of $318,000 is sought for the United Nations <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to make it quite clear that I visited Lockhart recently for the first time for a number of years in company with other members of the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> visited all these places in one week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I denounce as completely untrue any suggestion that  Senator Keeffe  acted in any way without complete propriety and decorum when I was with him on Tuesday 30 October when we visited Lockhart River, on any occasion at any of the areas that we visited during that week or on any other occasion when the Senate Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has conducted its investigations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise only to associate myself with the sentiments that have been expounded by  Senator Little  on the conduct of the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and its investigation into the conditions of Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that mercury has been detected in fish in the vicinity of the Derwent River and other Australian waters, can the Minister say what the Australian Council of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is doing with respect to industrial effluent control? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to the first part of the honourable senator’s questionanother environmental question- let me say that the Australian Environmental Council has established a sub-committee on marine pollution which is examining the whole range of issues relating to the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A standing committee of the Australian Environmental Council is meeting in Canberra today and the Ministers are to meet in Hobart on 30 November and the work of the sub-committee will be discussed at these meetings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Premier of Tasmania now has turned down the offer of $8m for expenditure on a moratorium on the flooding of Lake Pedder, and as the Minister has displayed such keen interest in the conservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Australia’s most beautiful State- Tasmania- and further, as it is increasingly and tragically clear that the destruction by pollution of the Derwent and Tamar Rivers and possibly parts of the north-west coast of Tasmania is taking place, will the Minister reconsider the offer and give the Tasmanian Government an opportunity to accept the money to meet the cost of steps necessary to save those rivers and that coastline? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All new proposals must be the subject of an environmental impact study. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Urban and Regional Development has agreed with the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation that there shall be an inquiry as to whether any adverse effect will result from the road being so close to the Lake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-My question, which I address to the Minister for Customs and Excise, refers to a statement on the export of kangaroo products which was made by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation yesterday in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has that Department submitted a management program which the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation considers does not meet the requirements laid down by the working party set up by the Commonwealth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My question is directed to either the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation or the Minister for Customs and Excise and concerns the report prepared by the working party which studied kangaroo conservation methods and harvesting programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have an opportunity to help this industry, which is one of the most wonderful industries in Australia, in this age of regard for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, in which  Senator Mulvihill  should rejoice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so will he advise the extent to which the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation has investigated the economics and environmental advisability of adopting the use of solar energy in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am fortified in my remarks by some of the statements that were made in 1972 at the United Nations Conference on the Human <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and also at a parliamentary conference that took place a few weeks later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At a meeting in Stockholm from 6 to 15 June 1972 the United Nations Conference on the Human <span class="highlight">Environment</span> carried the following resolutions: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having considered the need for a common outlook and for common principles to inspire and guide the peoples of the world in the preservation and enhancement of the human <span class="highlight">environment</span>, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Man is both creature and moulder of his <span class="highlight">environment</span> which gives him physical sustenance and affords him the opportunity for intellectual, moral, social and spiritual growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the long and tortuous evolution of the human race on this planet a stage has been reached when through the rapid acceleration of science and technology, man has acquired the power to transform his <span class="highlight">environment</span> in countless ways and on an unprecedented scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both aspects of man’s <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the natural and the man-made, are essential to the well-being and to the enjoyment of basic human rights- even the right to life itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The protection and improvement of the human <span class="highlight">environment</span> is a major issue which affects the well-being of peoples and economic development throughout the world; it is the urgent desire of the peoples of the whole world and the duty of all governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The third proclamation of the United Nations Conference on the Human <span class="highlight">Environment</span> states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Wrongly or heedlessly applied, the same power can do incalculable harm to human beings and the human <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We see around us growing evidence of man-made harm in many regions of the earth: dangerous levels of pollution in water, air, earth and living beings; major and undesirable disturbances to the ecological balance of the biosphere; destruction and depletion of irreplaceable resources; and gross deficiencies harmful to the physical, mental and social health of man, in the man-made <span class="highlight">environment</span>; particularly in the living and working <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Largely this is a State responsibility, but unfortunately not all States are mindful of the great moral and legal responsibility placed upon them to protect this part of man’s <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In order to safeguard the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> and its resources through the development of effective and workable principles and laws, the information and insight of international and regional fishery bodies, as well as the national fishery agencies are essential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both aspects of man’s <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the natural and the man-made, are essential to his well-being and to the enjoyment of basic human rights- even the right to life itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The protection and improvement of the human <span class="highlight">environment</span> is a major issue which affects the well-being of peoples and economic development throughout the world; it is the urgent desire of the peoples of the whole world and the duty of all governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We see around us growing evidence of man-made harm in many regions of the earth: dangerous levels of pollution in water, air, earth and living beings; major and undesirable disturbances to the ecological balance of the biosphere; destruction and depletion of irreplaceable resources; and gross deficiences harmful to the physical, mental and social health of man, in the man-made <span class="highlight">environment</span>; particularly in the living and working <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the developing countries most of the environmental problems are caused by under-development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The natural growth of population continuously presents problems on the preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, but with the adoption of appropriate policies and measures these problems can be solved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To defend and improve the human <span class="highlight">environment</span> for present and future generations has become an imperative goal for mankind- a goal to be pursued together with, and in harmony with, the established and fundamental goals of peace and of world-wide economic and social development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation produced a report recommending that turtle farming should be run as as conservation project on a cottage farm concept in which turtles would be farmed and then released into the sea as a means of maintaining and ensuring turtle stocks which are being depleted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government acted on the report of the House of Representatives Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, chaired by  Dr Jenkins,  the project would become a conservation project and would become the responsibility of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass),  and I would not be responsible for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the young of my race mean the kind of black power which says that I am proud of my race and I am as good as the next person, and if they get out and help themselves in the white man’s <span class="highlight">environment</span> and beat him at his own game, I say that is good black power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have discussed this question with the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation and I can only say that the response to the lead given by this Government for an enlightened national kangaroo conservation program has been disappointing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am having discussions with the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation,  Dr Cass,  with a view to deciding whether those exports which are approved under the circumstances I have already outlined should be terminated except where the products have been derived from kangaroos taken in accordance with a national conservation program which is satisfactory to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we to believe that the meeting in Western Australia between the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation,  Dr Cass,  and the Western Australian Minister for Fisheries and Fauna in regard to the lifting of the ban on the export of kangaroo products was a lot of ballyhoo for local consumption, because in interviews with both Ministers it was stated on the media that this would lead to the lifting of the ban on the export of kangaroo products? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What action has the Minister taken to ban the chemical Weedazol which had disastrous effects on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> when used recently in a weed killing test in South Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only today the ‘Canberra Times’ published the report of the Australian Advisory Committee on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> which was set up to consider the effects of exposure to supersonic aircraftand the falsifying of the Government was revealed again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been no attempt to understate the difficulties or uncertainties in Australia’s strategic <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 12 March 1974,  Senator Laucke  asked the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation the following question, without notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I have been informed by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation that there have been some additional developments since that time and you may find the following information helpful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator McLAREN- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That conference was attended by  Dr Cass,  the Australian Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, the Honourable G. F. Freudenstein, M.L.A., Minister for Conservation in New South Wales, the Honourable Robert Dunstan, M.L.A., Minister for Water Supply in Victoria, and the Honourable J. D.

    <p>Further, research programs in agricultural and biological sciences often have broad implications for the quality of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> generally, and for the maintenance of the productive capacity of renewable resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I had a look at this matter previously in regard to the reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> in connection with a previous proposal on the South Coast of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In presenting this second progress report, I wish to refer only briefly to the activities of the Senate Standing Committees on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> in its examination of the environmental conditions of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the preservation of their sacred sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second progress report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> relating to its reference to investigate the environmental conditions of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islands and the preservation of their sacred sites has been brought forward by its  Chairman,  Senate Keeffe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report has been tabled in the Senate today against a wide variety of activities and an <span class="highlight">environment</span> of changing events. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like so many matters relating to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Aborigines the processes tend to be slower than some would like to see them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 would like to enumerate for the benefit of honourable senators these other inquiries: Firstly, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation into the question of farming turtles in the Torres Strait Islands; secondly, the Special Minister of State’s inquiries comprising a report by a Melbourne accountant,  Mr L.  P. Smart, into the organisation and management of the turtle farming project and a joint report by 2 scientists,  Dr A.  F. Carr and Professor A. E. Main, into the ecological implications of a turtle farming project; thirdly, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts investigation into Aboriginal housing in the Northern Territory; fourthly, the Auditor-General ‘s inquiry into the financial and managerial aspects of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs; fifthly, the Public Service Board inquiry into administrative procedures of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the nature of this core force, our geographical position as an island continent, with a vast oceanic and archipelagic <span class="highlight">environment</span>, suggests some fundamental defence requirements and skills to be developed and preserved in all 3 Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However I do not share the attitude, apparent in some public comment on our defence posture, that change in our strategic <span class="highlight">environment</span> means that we shall necessarily be less secure, and that we must now act on the assumption that, when uncertainties resolve, things will be worse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given Australia’s ocean-archipelago <span class="highlight">environment</span>, long range maritime patrol aircraft are a necessary part of Australia’s force structure at all times for both military and civil purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s proposals recognise that the Australian people have a right to enjoy this country’s historical heritage and its unique <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and that that right should not be limited by the interests of particular groups in our community who are concerned, for private gain, to take those rights away from the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To take up the assertions made by  Senator Webster,  I remember that in the last Parliament there was an idea- it was actually implementedto have a joint committee on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The project has been developed with careful consideration for the protection and enhancement of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measures designed to protect the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> will include a soil conservation program to reduce erosion in the catchment area and sediment deposit in Lake Burley Griffin; the preservation of permanent geological features including the London Bridge; a natural limestone bridge over Burra Creek which is a geological feature with tourist potential; and the undergrounding of pipelines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But I wish to quote the remarks of another Minister,  Dr Cass,  the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I believe what I read in that newspaper because it substantiates the views that have been put to me by doctors who have come to Australia to escape this public service <span class="highlight">environment</span> and it has also been put in letters which I have received over the years from hundreds of patients who believe that the system in Australia is far from preferable to the one that they experienced for many years in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He comes down solidly in support of the concept of fee for service medical treatment in the community centre <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Treaty deals with a matter of environmental importance to both countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation currently is looking into this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These professional skills should blend with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Glebe both in its landscape and its community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, I believe that the lessons that will be learnt from the Glebe project, the detailed understanding of the problems of low income earners living in the inner city, and the solutions which emerge towards providing an effective way for the community to participate in shaping their <span class="highlight">environment</span> will be of immense benefit to governments, professional people and to all those concerned with improving the quality of life in our cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 24 May 1972 the Minister for bits and pieces, as we used to call him, the Minister for  the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts, the Honourable Peter Howson, apparently expressed a certain belief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National Health and Medical Research Council, the Australian Fisheries Council and the Australian Agricultural Council are also concerned with aspects of water quality, whilst the recently formed Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council, in its wider role, has decided to set up a specialist committee to investigate and, where appropriate, to make recommendations for national emission standards and guides to environmental quality criteria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council at its meeting on 7 April recognised the need for a greater public awareness of matters concerning the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and agreed that each Minister will take immediately appropriate steps to promote this awareness in his own sphere, lt also instructed its Standing Committee to propose for its consideration at its next meeting ways and means of improving public knowledge of the needs of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conjunction with my Department, the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation has established a working group for the purposes of making a comprehensive report on the economic and environmental factors associated with the wood chip industry in Australia and also with the softwood planting program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation able to say whether the Australian Environmental Council has laid down any guidelines with respect to environmental studies associated with projects such as the Redcliffs petrochemical works in South Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to a statement made by  Dr John  Coulter, the Vice-President of the Conservation Council of South Australia, which described the South Australian Government’s document planned for the environmental study of the Redcliffs project as ‘pathetic’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the national importance of protecting Australian waters against industrial pollution, will the Federal Government seek the cooperation of the South Australian Government to comply with the request of the Conservation Council of South Australia that a 3-month public review period be allowed to consider an environmental impact study associated with the Redcliffs project? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the question the honourable senator asked, seeking details of the Redcliffs project and the problems in relation to it, is a matter for the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been considered by all the departments responsible- the Postmaster-General’s Department, the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation and the Department of Housing and Construction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The AIDC must take into account monetary policy and policies in relation to trade practices, the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, industrial relations, the efficiency of industry and regional development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the mining company has appealed directly to the Privy Council, thereby giving British judges the right to determine this important <span class="highlight">environment</span> issue, will the Attorney-General give urgent consideration to offering financial help to the Wyong Council in its endeavours to retain this valuable natural area for the people of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He knows that  Dr McMichael  of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation is a member of the River Murray Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All honourable senators know the environmental difficulties involved in this project and these have been thoroughly canvassed in some detail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An environmental impact statement was prepared in conjunction with the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation and it has been circulated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Screen planting will be provided for the pumping station and the water treatment plant to reduce the impact of those structures on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note with appreciation that the Minister in his second reading speech has given expression to this very fact and has gone as far as to acknowledge that the non-bank institutions when operating in a competitive <span class="highlight">environment</span> certainly increase the efficiency of our financial sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no denying that these non-bank financial institutions operating in a competitive <span class="highlight">environment</span> can increase the efficiency, of the financial sector attracting funds and channelling them into the areas they are needed most. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition agrees with the general principle that we should preserve and furbish an inner city area, that we should as far as possible avoid displacement of people in the community; that we should help people on low incomes to live close to the city; and that we should improve the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A test of the bona fides of this Government will be whether or not it is willing to provide more money for the development in Waterloo which is an area in which we could go far more extensively into providing the kind of <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the inner city area that we need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is the State Planning Authority in New South Wales which soon is to be replaced by the Department of Planning and <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We, as an Opposition, have spelt out our desire that the quality of life and the essential <span class="highlight">environment</span> and ecology should be predominant at all times and that within the inner city areas we should do all that we can to revive the city, to look after the precious heritage of the Rocks, Glebe and elsewhere and to aim at giving decent housing to people on low incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Government has acted correctly in setting up virtually in the heart of Sydney a social laboratory capable of being interpreted in consultation with the local people to work out what are the best ways in which low income groups, as well as those in the middle groups, may be acclimatised and established in a local <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We will seek to retain something of the human <span class="highlight">environment</span> which has made this an attractive area for those people who live within it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is what the Labor Government is all about: It wants to establish a co-operative movement between the 3 arms of government and the local residents, to establish an infrastructure of some sort which will enable us to see how people want to live, where people want to live, what <span class="highlight">environment</span> they want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would have provided a little longer time in office for this poor Prime Minister who, in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the country, is putting forward such peevish propositions as this and who is for all the world like the chicken that has come out of the coop, pecked and worried and bleeding from the hawks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In July 1972 the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be required to interfere as little as possible with navigation, to have regard to the conservation of the reserves of the sea and the sea bed, to have regard to operations being carried on by other persons engaged in similar activities and to consider, in the exercise of its functions, factors connected with the ecology and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The use of this term first arose in 1969 when, following the most profitable decade in the history of the oil industry, that industry faced problems in relation to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, import quotas and the oil depletion allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A very important development is the fact that the AIDC will be required to invest according to certain guidelines relating to Government policy in relation to trade practices legislation, <span class="highlight">environment</span>, industrial relations and efficiency in industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If nothing else, those guidelines provide a significant new factor in Australian business which has not been present before and which hopefully might set an example to great Australian private industries which have not concerned themselves with guidelines such as environmental protection, the efficiency of industry generally and industrial relations policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The increase in charges foreshadowed by the Government is not much of an anti-inflationary measure, but it is essential if any kind of brake is to be put on a form of social investment which is heavily capital-consuming and, henceforth, in a capital-scarce <span class="highlight">environment</span> like ours, inflationary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Redcliffs Project: Environmental Consequences  Senator Wheeldon-On  30 July 1974,  Senator Jessop  asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, the following question without notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation: Is the Government aware that a group of unions in Victoria is standing over the Victorian Government by simply telling it that the power station, essential for Victoria’s future power needs, is not to be built at Newport? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As this area has already attracted the attention of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and ConservationI understand he is absent from Australia at present- and as he has inspected the place and said that it should be preserved as a priceless historic feature for South Australia, will the Minister take urgent steps to see that this area is declared part of the National Estate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I personally and many of my Aboriginal fellows find nothing wrong with money being allocated for Aboriginal advancement as the advancement must be taking place in a new <span class="highlight">environment</span> that is different from what was the Aboriginal way of life before the 1788 invasion of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr President, I think it was Galbraith who once drew attention to the nexus between ideas and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of people who conceive those ideas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These courts, while they continue to operate in often overcrowded conditions, in antiquated buildings and in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> not always conducive to the careful consideration of important decisions affecting the intimate lives of citizens must remain as the Commonwealth finds them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that it was obviously desirable that the courts should be operating in the same <span class="highlight">environment</span> and working together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Subsequent to the establishing of the Act and the commencement of the construction an Act was passed by the Parliament of Victoria providing for an <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Authority, an independent body over which the Minister had no power of direction and which had the obligation to pass judgment upon whether government decisions and government proposals were consistent with environmental protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the Government of Victoria which requested the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Authority to conduct an inquiry into whether the Newport power station should be built. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result was that in 1973 the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Authority reported that under certain conditions, which the Authority said it could enforce and would enforce, the power station could proceed, be licensed and, as the report of the Authority said, be a compatible neighbour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An appeal was taken by third parties- by interested conservationists- to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Authority, and from that Authority an appeal went to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Appeal Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is relevant to refer to the decision of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Appeal Board because this proposal, costing $145m in 1971 and now costing a sum vastly in excess of that, has gone through the parliamentary procedures and through all the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection procedures which a Parliament has laid down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Appeal Board said in its judgment: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the present appeals, the third parties have focused public attention on the proposed power station in a manner which has called upon the Commission to justify to the fullest extent its proposed activity and to demonstrate that such activity will present no threat to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> or to public health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Board is satisfied that the proposed amendments are reasonable and that adherence to the revised conditions will not have any adverse effect on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Board is satisfied that adherence to these amended standards will meet the requirements of the Authority in having no adverse effects on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could read- I have it here if anyone wants to see it- the full judgment of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Appeal Board and see from it that there is absolutely no risk either to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> or to public health in Victoria, in the Board’s judgment, if the conditions are observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These questions, which in this case were decided by the Parliament and then through the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection procedures, are questions which ultimately are Parliament’s responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I indicated that the decision of the Parliament has been vindicated by the procedures of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Poyser is a member of the Victorian Labor Party which had the opportunity to go before these various bodies to express its protest and to ask the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Authority and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Appeals Board to consider the various matters upon which it is now relying but no attempt was made to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it was on 23 November 1972 that the Premier of Victoria indicated that the matter would be referred by the Government to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was after the decision of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Appeal Board some 2 or 3 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would have to be new hearings by the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Doubtless, there would be appeals to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Appeal Board and the question of land acquisition might well be involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is relevant to recall that  Dr Cass  as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation had originally said that he felt the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Appeal Board had reached a decision which it was difficult to understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The joint operations with the State fauna authorities were very good and demonstrated how mutual co-operation between these groups can provide a more effective control of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> to reduce the incidence of unlawful movement and trafficking of fauna both within and without Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the question of referring the report to the appropriate committee, I suppose the Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> would cover matters such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will the Attorney-General reject the request and inform the Foundation that it should accept the decisions of the Victorian Government <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Authority and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Appeals Board before which its representatives appeared? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember clearly how I questioned  Mr Dunstan  during the election campaign as to what protection there would be of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Spencer Gulf, especially in relation to the prawn industry, which is based on a very delicate environmental factor in those waters, and of course other factors of general pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I leave the environmental factor I wish to remind the House that the Premier said in April before the 1973 election that the environmental question had been cleared; yet in May 1974, over one year later, a report of his own Government- of course, a report obtained under the pressure of politics in my State- under the heading of Effluents’, in part of a very large report of the South Australian Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, said that little information is yet available on the nature and quantities of plant effluents and noise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>respective Federal Minister had to bring discipline to the question of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in this matter because the State Government was incapable, following the first standard that the Premier set, of looking after environmental questions of the Spencer Gulf in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not need it at the destruction of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Spencer Gulf; we do not need it at the destruction of the operation of free competitive trade in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Federal Government to take the same disciplines in regard to other parts of the indenture as it has taken in relation to the part which has included the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ad hoc programs based on limited funds will never achieve the wishes of this Government and the States to give a reasonable standard of urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> to all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To do this we must provide an urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> which includes all of the facilities and life style demanded by the Australian people and provide them at a reasonable cost The third part of our program is designed to arrest and to reverse the decline in the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> of our great cities, and to improve the services within them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second reading speech of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  representing the Minister for the Media, stated that the amendments gave 2 new powers to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board which the general public had always thought the Board had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: Is it not a fact that whilst the trade unions have played an important role in their quest to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and general quality of life in the working class area of Newport in Victoria, these same unions are simply spearheading a campaign on behalf of numerous environmental groups and people living in the immediate and surrounding area of the district in which the Victorian Government is insisting that a new power station be built? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Curiously, the trade union movement has been in the forefront of the campaign in various cities to save the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, especially in relation to projects like the Clutha project in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think it is reasonable to expect that those governments- I am speaking particularly of the governments of the political colour of the Opposition- ought to be catching up with the world-wide movement directed towards preserving and improving our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is partly a constructional one and partly an environmental one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite satisfied now that that was a mistake and the concentration of so many personnel in a place which is not at all natural in terms of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is one of the hazards facing this industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In future any Postmaster-General or relevant commission ought to consider the separation of the types of employment in such an organisation, and more consideration should be given to the working situations from an environmental point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I start on the basis that all governments and indeed all sections of the community are as one in desiring to improve the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to improve what is now known as the quality of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The debates in the Parliament at that time indicate the warnings of Labor speakers that unless Commonwealth responsibility for finance, planning and other aspects was accepted in this area we would finally reach a point where we would suffer in our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and in our quality of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The development of Monarto, the development of Albury-Wodonga, the appropriation of the Glebe lands for redevelopment in an imaginative way, the proposed appropriation of 90 acres of land at Woolloomooloo for new development in an imaginative way, the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate, which for the first time has established criteria about the essential heritage of this nation and the sort of things of which, when the petty issues of today are gone, Australian children of the future can be proud, including the vital heritage of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the landscape and the buildings which are so important in the building of a national tradition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This program will be determined in consultation with the States and the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  has already written to each State Minister responsible for wildlife and national parks asking for proposals of acquisition to be submitted for consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The environmental impact statement procedure introduced through this Bill represents a development and improvement of policies adopted by the previous Government in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Government had required impact statements to be prepared on environmentally important proposals being considered by Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In considering requests by State Governments for financial assistance for major development projects, the previous Government merely required assurance that associated environmental factors had been suitably investigated and taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this legislation, the Australian Government will extend the impact statement requirement to cover any proposal in which it is involved and which is likely to have a significant effect on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, irrespective of whether or not it is a matter to be decided by Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, it will be used to ensure that the environmental effects of mining and woodchip proposals are thoroughly evaluated before any decision is taken on export licences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These extensions merely use Australian Government constitutional powers which, because of the indifference of earlier government to environmental issues, were never applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council there has been basic agreement on what statements should cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government will have to rely to a large extent on State Government advice in assessing the environmental consequences of proposals in which it is involved and which are being developed in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extent to which it will rely on State <span class="highlight">environment</span> authorities will depend on the confidence it has in those authorities, on its judgment of their independence and on the significance of the proposals from the national viewpoint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, where the environmental consequences of a proposal are considered to be particularly significant, or where there is considerable public controversy over these consequences, a public inquiry will be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following public scrutiny the impact statement will be finalised and submitted, together with the report from any public inquiry, to the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation for assessment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The assessment of the environmental consequences will be conveyed to Cabinet at the same time as the proposal itself is put to Cabinet for consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus we will ensure Cabinet considers the economic, technological and environmental consequences of proposals at the same time, before any decision is taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The procedure will not give to environmental considerations a veto-power in decision-making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Environmental considerations will become an integral part of the information upon which a decision is taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It represents a very significant step forward in contributing to the adequate protection of our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and should be of real benefit to all Australians, irrespective of their occupation, their political outlook or their place of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation,  Dr Moss  Cass, was allocated a government flat in Canberra in 1974? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister and some other Ministers in addition to the Minister for Science have earlier expressed strong misgivings about proposals to dump nuclear waste in the Antarctic, especially in the absence of scientific data concerning the likely effect of such dumping on the Antarctic <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">environment</span> produced by the billions of years of evolution which has resulted in man in his present state, is being drastically altered in a few decades by man himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  will also soon be introducing a Bill to make finance available to the States for nature conservation purposes and a Bill creating a Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will deal with important aspects of environmental concern, in addition to nature conservation, aimed at halting man’s unthinking degradation of the total <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the genesis of life on this planet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill has been amended in the House of Representatives to clarify its objectives and, to this end, during the debate the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  quoted from a letter from the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to the Premiers which elaborated the conditions of the grants as mentioned in Clause 4 (5) of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wish to acknowledge, if I may, the co-operation given in the other place by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation,  Dr Cass,  to my colleague  Mr Hunt  and in this place by the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation in an attempt to remove the areas of disputation in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation in another place has said repeatedly that it is not the intention of the Commonwealth Government to seek to override or to supplant the States in their role in connection with national parks, wildlife and nature conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can test this- indeed the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  has said in another place that he recognises this- by introducing a motion which incorporates the wording that the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  has used in another device. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Together with the senior adviser of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass), Dr McMichael,  who in a State capacity, accepted, as do all major Parties now, the responsibility that the Australian Government has in this particular field, together with the redoubtable New South Wales conservationist Milo Dunphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that that is what is in the mind of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation,  Dr Cass. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report deals with the vexed question of the jurisdiction of the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation as distinct from that of the Minister for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fate of these, and the manner and extent to which man and other biota in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> may be subjected to them are important matters on which some information has been sought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In setting effective anti-pollution safeguards not only is the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protected but mining companies immediately know the standards which they must maintain and will know if and when they can operate so removing speculation from their activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential that mining companies can move in a predictable <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which to make decisions and that governments do not leave them (up in the air) as to their rights and obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to be sure, if it is to be under the control of  Dr Cass  and future Ministers for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, that there are adequate powers to ensure that the Minister will not be subservient to perhaps some Minister for Minerals and Energy who might encourage a mineral survey in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have had lengthy correspondence with  Mr Broomhill,  the Minister of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only thing I would like to add at this stage is some reference to the amendment which has been moved by  Senator Carrick  to the effect that the Australian Government has in some way bypassed the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory and that the statutory authorities and voluntary environmental and conservation groups in the Territory should be involved in these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The material which has been given to me by the Secretary of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation reads as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also an officer of the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation -  attended a public seminar on National Parks held in Darwin and answered questions in relation to the proposed legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A telegram was sent by  Dr Goff  Letts, the majority leader in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  to which the Minister has replied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>National Parks and Wildlife Bill due further consideration this week will have greatest impact Northern Territory stop There have been no public hearing or proper consultations as suggested in first principle of stated functions of Dept <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation stop I have prepared statement for first meeting Legislative Assembly this week stop Not opposed certain concepts in Bill e.g. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>tables report (b) Government considers executive role newly elected Assembly after studying above report (c) Ministers for Northern Territory and <span class="highlight">Environment</span> have discussions Assembly representatives (d) Northern Territory public properly consulted stop Further passage Bill this week would show contempt Territory people and new Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a very strong telegram from  Dr Letts  particularly in view of the circumstances which were outlined in the memorandum from the Secretary of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government’s legislative program must proceed stop Please be assured of Northern Territory interests being considered at all times in matters of <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill brings into focus an important tendency in the modern community to assert that when government is making policies of any kind it should take into account the effect, if any, upon the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of those policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore over recent years the States have passed legislation insisting that where some action is to be taken by a private or other authority there be prepared a document, an environmental impact study, and that that document be used by governments in determining whether the particular proposal should go on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that governments at all levels should look to the impact on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> before they take action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It supports the Council of Environmental Ministers which, when considering procedural matters, agreed on what should be the nature of an environmental impact study and decided that all statements should assert the need for the particular undertaking, its objective, what alternative means there are to achieve the same ends or goals and what the environmental impact might be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the other place a number of questions of this type were raised with the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I write concerning several matters which you raised in the debate last Wednesday night on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the latter respect, it is my understanding, from discussions that have occurred within the Standing Committee of the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council, that the States would not be prepared to enter into any such agreement or arrangement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for this reason that I am encouraged by agreement that has so far been reached in the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say, that in respect of Victoria, my departmental officers advise me that already they are relying very considerably on advice received from the Victorian Ministry of Conservation in assessing the environmental effects of proposals being developed in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 4 Bills to which I refer represent the culmination of 2 years of extremely hard work and enlightened dedication by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation  (Dr Cass),  and their significance should not be overlooked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, this is the first time in Australia that there has been any statutory attempt to go nearly so far in relation to environmental impact statements as this Bill seeks to go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The measure deals not just with pollution, not just with aesthetics, not just with environmental matters in any narrow sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order that the true effect of the Bills can be understood I invite the attention of the Senate to the extremely embracing definition of the word <span class="highlight">environment</span>’ appearing in clause 3. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does seem to me that too many persons at least up to date, have taken the view that environmental matters are narrow in their concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite the attention of the Senate to the first proclamation of the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human <span class="highlight">Environment</span> as to the scope of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as that proclamation saw it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Man is both creature and moulder of his <span class="highlight">environment</span>, which gives him physical sustenance and affords him the opportunity for intellectual, moral, social and spiritual growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the long and tortuous evolution of the human race on this planet a stage has been reached when, through the rapid acceleration of science and technology, man has acquired the power to transform his <span class="highlight">environment</span> in countless ways and on an unprecedented scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both aspects of man’s <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the natural and the man-made, are essential to his well-being and to the enjoyment of basic human rightseven the right to life itself. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would for myself add the further point that I do not think that in the ultimate any question of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the true sense can be considered in isolation from the question of planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, environmental issues do not exist in a vacuum; they are related to the planned development of this earth and everything about it for the benefit of man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to pay a very brief tribute to the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation,  Dr Cass,  because I know from extremely bitter personal experience how difficult it is at times for a Minister charged with this type of portfolio to be able to achieve ministerial co-operation, at least completely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe it correct to say that anyone has ever made a proper assessment of the effect of the wood chip industry in relation to the whole ecology of Australia and to the general question of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could debate this matter at length but all I want to say is that if this Bill is passed the first thing I propose to do is to request the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation to direct an inquiry on a national basis under clause 1 1 into all aspects of the wood chip industry so far as it affects Australia and our future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Government and the Minister,  Dr Cass,  in particular, have grasped the nettle with this Bill and they have given the nation of Australia a basis for hoping that man will intelligently mould to his total <span class="highlight">environment</span>, including his social groupings, to his advancement and happiness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion this is a day for which responsible environmentalists have hoped but their hopes, I suggest, would never have materialised without the enlightened policies of the Australian Government which now are in statutory form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think everybody acknowledges that in the late twentieth century the twin questions of how man controls his <span class="highlight">environment</span> and how man respects his privacy are the most vital questions for the development and future of mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see, as we did not see earlier, despoliation of our natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> inways which were quite perceptibly occurring but the import of which was never sufficiently appreciated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that just in the expression of some views we can resolve these problems in the future and at least make the community aware that desirable and commendable as the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is, it ought not to be done at the cost of the preservation of individual privacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the subject of impact statements the statement made on behalf of the then Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts read:   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to announce that the Government has decided to introduce a system of ‘impact statements’ designed to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is to say that when a Commonwealth Minister prepares a submission to the Cabinet on any proposal that has some relevance to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> that submission must be accompanied by a statement setting out the impact the proposal is likely to make on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might add that State projects for which Commonwealth financial assistance is sought will also need to be supported by assurances that all environmental factors have been considered and evaluated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, one difference is to be noted, and that is that under the proposals which the Government is implementing, it seeks to have its own impact statement procedures apply to Commonwealth financed State projects, whereas the view of the previous Governmentand it would be the view which the present Opposition parties would preferably follow- was that the State procedures ought to be sufficient for an effective evaluation of impact on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of various types of proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Before the sitting of the Senate was suspended I was indicating that the power which the Commonwealth Government was asserting in respect of this <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection legislation was immensely wide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">environment</span> is defined as including all aspects of the surroundings of man, whether affecting him as an individual or in his social groupings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘Environmental’ has a corresponding meaning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is immensely important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I go further: On 3 1 October I asked the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation who represents the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation in this place a question about the Newport power station project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also asked the Minister whether he was aware that this attitude was being taken against a background of exhaustive inquiries into the environmental impact of such a power station and the fact that those inquiries had been held and that all of them had been resolved in favour of the power station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked the Minister whether he was prepared, in the interests of balanced and sensible environmental policies and with a view to upholding the authority of the State of Victoria, to express his strong support for the Victorian Government’s position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wheeldon,  the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, stated quite categorically in simple words ‘no’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Victorian legislation which will be to a large extent duplicated by this legislation- indeed, it may even be superseded, but ultimately that is for the High Court to decide- indicates that there is an <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Authority and an <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Appeals Board which can examine whether projects in Victoria are consistent with what is required for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a challenge to the authority of the Government and it is being conducted in the name of <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-And <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection, to answer the Minister, is the name of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe we ought to have an attitude expressed by the Government which clearly discloses where it stands on this matter with regard to State <span class="highlight">environment</span> projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said earlier that the need to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is quite clear and unchallengeable, but this Bill imposes upon individuals the right to submit to the requests of persons appointed by the Minister- who are not judicial officers but who may be anybody in the community whom the Minister appoints- to attend before them, to answer questions, to produce documents, and indeed to allow their properties and premises to be entered without any warrant whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I suggest that you cannot resolve satisfactorily these environmental protection questions by simply saying that individuals can be subjected to all sorts of impositions, to coercive powers, because the <span class="highlight">environment</span> requires that individuals must submit to those powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation whether the Minister has recommended the relaxation in New South Wales and South Australia of the export ban on kangaroo skins and products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable senator probably would be aware, I do not have the information relating to this matter at my fingertips but I will obtain it from the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation as soon as possible and let him have the answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the last few months the State Planning Authority, which was the successor to the Cumberland County Council, has been abolished and we have a Planning and <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Commission under the direct control of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If people are to be resettled in a better <span class="highlight">environment</span> in Darwin and if they are to suffer no monetary loss, who is to say that that is not right? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that based on the evolutionary experience of planning in Australia members of the Opposition will not turn the clock back; that they will learn from the experiences of people even within their own Party and within their own State governments; that they will even at this late hour discuss the matter with  Mr Fuller,  the Minister for Planning and <span class="highlight">Environment</span> in New South Wales, and with  Mr Hamer  in Victoria and those other enlightened Ministers who, based on their experiences, have seen the need to change the emphasis from the bureaucracy back to the Parliament; that the Senate will not be stampeded, on the basis of a false, incorrect and inadequate understanding of what is involved in this important Darwin Reconstruction Bill, into amending the Bill, emasculating it and rendering it sterile when the important job is to pass the Bill to enable the Australian Government properly to carry out its responsibilities to the people in Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators opposite have any doubts about it then I suggest they should look at the manner in which the Ministers have operated and at the way in which I have operated in local governmentinvolving people at all stages in their immediate affairs and not relying upon bureaucratic processes to create the better <span class="highlight">environment</span> that we all want to see. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For instance, the Australian Government Printing Office, which is responsible for the printing of millions of dollars worth of government publications, was an adjunct of the old Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Aborigines and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendment seeks to leave open to any person in Australia the right to object to a determination, whether they have a vested interest or a peculiar interest such as conservation or <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Putting aside such gratuitous comments as the last statement, the fact of the matter is that  Senator Gietzelt  is saying quite clearly- I fully agree with him- that if in its wisdom the Commission decides that it will resettle people in a better <span class="highlight">environment</span> in Darwin, that is its prerogative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It could never get anywhere unless it recognised, as a national party, the need for national involvement- by the national Government through the national Parliament -in the concerns of the people over the whole range of policy- their schools, their cities, their hospitals, their culture, their recreation, their immediate <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and providing access to jobs, shops and recreations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As has been reported previously to the Senate, there has been a thorough inquiry by the Water Resources Branch of the Department of Urban and Regional Development, by the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, by the River Murray Commission and, I believe, by the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation to see that there is no deterioration in the water supply as a result of the development of AlburyWodonga. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>During the debate on the report the Senate resolved that the Standing Committees on Health and Welfare, Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Constitutional and Legal Affairs should continually oversight the report and recommend from time to time the further measures which might be taken to implement the recommendation or overcome the problems revealed in the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they did not they would not be able to pay for the plush surgeries, the cars, <span class="highlight">environment</span> and rentals, or whatever, in which they live, with the rather small turnover they have and giving very lengthy, friendly consultations to the rich people of that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To the extent that the Australian Government is initiating supplementary economic measures and has appointed a Committee of  Inquiry  into Taxation Indexation, we welcome the emergence of an <span class="highlight">environment</span> within which wage indexation has the best chance of effective operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The change in name resulted from a suggestion from  Dr Cass,  the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He consideredand what he put forward was agreed to- that the title ‘<span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation’ was unnecessarily cumbersome, that the conservation referred to in the title ‘<span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation’ was intended to mean conservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and that it was a rather long winded title which caused some confusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remember that one day one honourable senator in this chamber, without attempting in any way to be satirical, referred to the Department as the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conversation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, in 1973, when the Australian Labor Party amended its platform, it amended the section which previously had been entitled ‘<span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation’ to ‘The <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It singles out 3 Ministers of the Crown, namely, the  Deputy  Leader of the Australian Labor Party,  Dr J.  F. Cairns, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Dr Cass,  and the present AttorneyGeneral,  Mr Enderby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to satisfy the people there is no substitute for natural growth development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his absence, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Dr Cass,  will act as Minister for Health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to  Senator Wheeldon  as Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, relates to a situation in Tasmania somewhat akin to the Fraser Island mining venture and raises the question of the necessity for an environmental impact study to be undertaken on any project on which work has already begun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Director of Environmental Control in Tasmania,  Mr Pottinger,  is now saying that before this work can be finished a study will be needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will realise that the text covers a pretty broad base and includes such things as the establishment of an economic zone, the breadth of territorial sea, the right of passage through international straits, rights over the resources of the continental shelf, archipelagos, fisheries, marine pollution, scientific research of the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and the pressing question of the rights to the resources of the deep sea bed beyond the national jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government give consideration to the proposal that from June 1975 the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and not the Department of Agriculture represent Australia at future International Whaling Commission meetings? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly would not agree to the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> providing the representative on the International Whaling Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are many children- I think it applies to most children- who for reasons of intellect, <span class="highlight">environment</span> and psychological and other reasons do not proceed to matriculation, colleges of advanced education or to university level, are left doing courses which in some States and in some schools are merely watered down versions of the academic level courses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already spoken of the importance of ethnic identification for many children caught in the no man’s land of ambivalence between their home <span class="highlight">environment</span> and that of their school still geared to the  assimilationists  ‘ goal of Angloconformity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In just the same way, if we have a legislative framework which declares that racial discrimination is illegal, that legislative framework in itself has some educative effect and it is part of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the context in which people grow up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They deal with the question of inheritability of IQ, the measure of intelligence generally and the whole question of the extent to which one’s intelligence is determined by <span class="highlight">environment</span> as against being determined by inheritance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for the Media: In view of the announced intention of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> to proceed with 2-minute radio commercials to inform the public about environmental issues, and the subsequent statement by a representative of private industry that it is a most unusual length of advertisement which apparently has not been available previously to private advertisers, is the Australian Broadcasting Control Board giving special consideration to the Government to enable it to broadcast radio advertisements of a most unusual length which is not available to private industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am told that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation advertising campaign is conducted on radio only and is sponsored by the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently the advertising is arranged through my Department and my Department is the servicing department but the actual preparation of the advertisements is the responsibility of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The campaign, which deals with the problems of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> generally, pollution, conservation and so on, is designed to make the community aware of the tremendous problems that exist in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Mr President, on behalf of the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> I present a general report on 4 references. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate will know that I, with others, am a member of one of the Senate Standing Committees, the Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I feel, looking at clause 31 again, that systematic and extensive programs of community education may in the long run very well be the most effective way of creating and maintaining a harmonious social <span class="highlight">environment</span> that is free from discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would it not be more sensible to look for species which are uniquely suitable to the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Can we assume that the inference is that animal breeding and husbandry in Australia are second class and unsuitable to our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and other research institutes are unaware of the constant need to fit species to the Australian circumstance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and climate are major contributors to the excellent standards of Australian meat, grain and fibre production? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that the Committee detected early that some reasonable employers wanted to do something about the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, but their competitors were not compelled to observe a certain code and could undercut on costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Admittedly the trade union movement believes that it has a responsibility to its membership beyond its industrial provisions, that it has a moral responsibility to its membership, to society and to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which the trade union movement works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one should impose upon an association of people the demand that they should in some way destroy the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they live and in which their children shall live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That organisation- that union- has a right to deny the use of its members, efforts and skills in protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trade union interest in environmental issues has arisen because of the growing concern about the effects of capitalism ‘s notions of perpetual economic growth and profit making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also concern at the devastation caused by capitalism’s regard for the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> as its sole preserve for the production of profits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer again to my previous question concerning the intention of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> to place advertisments of up to 2 minutes duration with commercial radio stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a power of enormous import- the power to compel people to present themselves and answer questions- and in that <span class="highlight">environment</span> the Commissioner may endeavour to reach a settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is scanned and, in addition, the inquiry is automatically routed to the other 3 sets of library information stored on the computers of CSIRO and the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these preliminary remarks I want to stress that the Department of Urban and Regional Development and the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> will jointly administer the great task of preserving and enhancing the National Estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also included programs to ensure that <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection was the key part of the decisions of the Government, and it started a wide range of programs for the rational management of Australian land, air, water, and biological resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediately the draft recommendations were known, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Dr Cass)  and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  set out to give life to the Government’s plans to protect and enhance the National Estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee has also advised the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> on the implementation of the States Grants (Nature Conservation) Act under which $9m was allocated this financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National Estate program must be seen in the whole context of Government policies for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and urban and regional development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also supplements several other Acts of Parliament including the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, the States Grants (Nature Conservation) Act and proposed legislation to create a Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They feel in much stronger measure the withering away of the physical <span class="highlight">environment</span> into ugly and barren patterns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also want to stress that we will seek the support of people of goodwill whatever their background to protect the National Estate and beat the bulldozer mentality that had disfigured our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relating its findings to the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the study group should focus particular attention and make recommendations on the functions and location of any institute and how it would relate to a national system of coaching and training; the types of courses and programs to be offered at such an institute and the facilities and staffing required to implement them; the development priorities and funding of any institute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-66-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has any interdepartmental committee visited Norfolk Island recently to examine the environmental impact of a proposal to upgrade the existing wartime airstrip for jet aircraft? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, who were the members of the committee, which departments did each represent and which of those officers is considered to have expertise in environmental matters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-An interdepartmental committee did not visit Norfolk Island to study this matter, but some officers of the Department of the Capital Territory visited the Island and have produced a draft environmental impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that meeting there will be representatives of the Department of the Capital Territory, the Department of Transport, the Department of Housing and Construction and the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The changes proposed are designed to achieve a balanced membership which will enhance the Corporation’s ability to perform its functions in a modern marketing <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In brief, these are to build a new and permanent Parliament House and to ensure parliamentary control of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> surrounding it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>those places, being components of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Australia or the cultural <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Australia, that have aesthetic, historic, scientific or social significance or other special value for future generations as well as for the present community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the essential principles are set out in clause 4 of the Bill where the National Estate is defined as follows:   the national estate consists of those places, being components of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Australia or the cultural <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Australia, that have aesthetic, historic, scientific or social significance or other special value for future generations as well as for the present community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of us have various views about the significance of our relationship, as members of the human species, with our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From now on, with this legislation and the other legislation to which I have referred as a basis, we can proceed in this country with guidelines which will provide perhaps a better <span class="highlight">environment</span> for future generations of Australians than that which has existed in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The three components of the cultural and natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> forming the National Estate are those which are: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that definition the Committee also pointed out that these things fall into many categories, some of them matters of natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>, some of them man-made and part of our cultural <span class="highlight">environment</span>, others archeological and others cultural. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They include land use, wildlife, parks, coastlines, built <span class="highlight">environment</span>, Aboriginal sites and special areas, historic sites, geological sites, caves, museums, historic shipwrecks, archives, export of cultural property and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were the first positive steps in the national sphere to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had a plan for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Ayers Rock and we were the government that established a royal commission on a national basis for an examination of all the superlative values of the Great Barrier Reef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Department of Works over which I presided in the latter years there was a standing instruction that no work was to be submitted to Cabinet unless an environmental impact study was undertaken on an interdepartmental basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:  (1)1 am not aware of any large scale surveys into the natural levels of mercury and mercurials in the total Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No figures are available on the losses of mercury and mercurials to the local <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to determine mercury accumulation in the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>, a continuous monitoring program would be required to examine mercury levels in sediment and in organisms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, a continuous monitoring program for the total <span class="highlight">environment</span> is not being carried out at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I moved for that disallowance so that representatives of the Academy of Science would be able further to put forward the point that the traffic which would flow from the arterial road from the off-take point would affect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Academy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Academy representatives told me that until the day before I moved for the disallowance they had been under the impression that the western distributor which would subsequently be built from the off-take point would go underground and therefore there would be minimal disturbance to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the vicinity of the Academy of Science. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were disturbed to find that no such final plan had been made and there was every possibility that the distributor might be above the ground, in which case the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Academy would be very seriously disturbed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reiterate my private hope that the matter can be adjusted to suit the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Dr Cass,  when Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, was ultra scrupulous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He wrote to the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Dr Cass)  on 27 April stating that he believed an expressway was to be built across the island and requesting the Minister’s support in reclaiming the island to be used for a recreational complex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The then Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> referred the matter to myself as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs saying that he doubted that he could interfere in this matter since his financial support is confined to areas of national park significance, which usually means a considerably larger area than that concerned in this matter’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The New South Wales Planning and <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Commission has apparently recommended to the Minister for Lands and Forests that the island remain in its natural state, with the small north-eastern tip of the island to be developed as a fishing port. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Planning and <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Commission recommended that the north-east tip of the island be linked to the mainland by an access road. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the present plan is regarded by the Tweed Shire Council as a satisfactory compromise between the wishes of the Council and the recommendations of the Planning and <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of representations which were made by the Opposition and by  Mr Hunt,  the shadow Minister responsible for these matters- and I must admit with the co-operation of the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Dr Cassrecognition  has been given to this problem and to the necessity to co-operate with the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Queensland senators on this side of the chamber, particularly  Senator Wood  who will be speaking later, will have a good deal of knowledge of what steps have been taken in the past to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in this region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I commend the shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Mr Hunt,  for his cooperation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As honourable senators know, the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Dr Cass)  in the other place was helpfulthe Opposition was helpful also- when a number of the clauses were considered in accepting a number of amendments to satisfy the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is understood that this was because the question of <span class="highlight">environment</span> was raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise this to draw the contrast between my decision to transfer the honourable member for Lalor from Treasury to <span class="highlight">Environment</span> on 6 June and my decision to advise the Governor-General to terminate his commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The answer to  Senator Keeffe  ‘s question is as follows: Yesterday the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> announced the purchase of 1000 hectares of land at Elanda Plains adjacent to the proposed Cooloola National Park in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present the effect of the activities of the equipment on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is under expert investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To intervene to ensure effective national development, to preserve and conserve’ the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and its resources, to stimulate competition arid to achieve equity . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the proposed takeover is judged not to be against the national interest on this basis, the following additional criteria will also be taken into account: Whether, after the takeover, the business concerned could be expected to follow practices consistent with Australia’s interest in matters such as exports, imports, local processing of materials produced, research and development and industrial relations; and whether the takeover would be consistent with the Government’s objectives in relation to such matters as defence, the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation, urban and regional development and the preservation of Aboriginal land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> wrote to the responsible State Ministers on 18 September 1974 inviting applications for financial assistance under the States Grants (Nature Conservation) Act for the acquisition of lands for nature conservation purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has not directed the preparation of environmental impact statements under the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 for any of the four projects identified above for the following reasons: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interests of clarifying the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1 would like to point out that the publication of an order required in Section 7 ( 1 ) of that Act refers to an order made under Section 6 of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 6 is concerned with Administrative Procedures which will provide general rules for the application of the environmental impact statement technique. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Act does not require the making or publication of orders relating to the preparation of environmental impact statements for specific proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently the Committee was concerned to preserve as much of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the proposed takeover is judged not to be against the national interest on this basis, the following additional criteria will also be taken into account: Whether, after the takeover, the business concerned could be expected to follow practices consistent with Australia’s interest in matters such as exports, imports, local processing of materials produced, research and development and industrial relations; and whether the takeover would be consistent with the Government’s objectives in relation to such matters as defence, the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation, urban and regional development and the preservation of Aboriginal land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And I emphasise this point-  reflects within the overall budgetary restraints the continuation of programs designed to improve the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the quality of life of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It requires time to work in a politically stable <span class="highlight">environment</span>; it probably does not have that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  question included a reference to the statement published in the Press today by  Mr Dick  Wordley, of the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Foundation, who was a witness yesterday before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In all defence facilities programs very close attention is now paid to <span class="highlight">environment</span> considerations to ensure as far as possible that solutions found are acceptable to all parties with genuine concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister states that the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is maintaining a close watch on the results of overseas studies as the theory, in his opinion, is not yet proven. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequent upon the Government’s decision to disapprove the determinations passing on the 3.6 per cent wage adjustment and in order to treat office holders within the jurisdiction of the Remuneration Tribunal consistently, I also have moved to disapprove the determinations of the Tribunal in respect of the Secretary to the PostmasterGeneral’s Department, Australian National Railways Commission, Commissioner for Community Relations, Commissioners under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, Road Safety and Standards Authority, Director of National Parks and Wildlife, Aboriginal Hostels Ltd, Schools Commission and Health Insurance Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the National Plan dispersants will only be used when their effect on the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> will be less than that of the oil if it were allowed to come ashore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-53-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand a committee is studying the desirability of increasing the authority of the River Murray Commission, or of establishing some other body to cover flood mitigation, erosion, pollution, <span class="highlight">environment</span> and navigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Concerning the honourable senator’s question about the River Murray, I can inform him that a working party was set up some time ago to report on a whole range of problems- pollution, erosion, flooding and environmental aspects- of the River Murray. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission’s decision that more of its work should be concerned with identifying, researching and providing well-documented advice on likely changes in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> for industry development should help to ensure that the social and economic effects of changes in assistance to industries are fully researched before Government decisions are taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recognising the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development as the virtual custodian of all national parks and fauna reserves in Australian Territories, I ask what guarantee he can give the Senate on the sanctity of the boundaries of the Kakadu National Park in the Top End of the Northern Territory in the face of utterances made by his colleague the Minister for National Resources contending that uranium extraction has first priority in the Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Northern Territory, with its unique <span class="highlight">environment</span>, has the potential to be one of the nation’s leading tourist destination areas both nationally and internationally, but cooperation between the Government and the tourist authorities in the Northern Territory is needed to bring this about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 13 December 1974 the Honourable Edward Gough Whitlam QC, then Prime Minister and Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, the Honourable Reginald Francis Xavier Connor, the then Minister for Minerals and Energy, The Honourable James Ford Cairns, the then Treasurer, and the Honourable Lionel Keith Murphy Q.C., then  Senator and  Attorney-General of this Commonwealth, purporting to act as and in a meeting of the Commonwealth Executive Council signed and/or caused to be signed a certain Minute Paper headed ‘Department of Minerals and Energy’ recommending for the approval of  His Excellency  the GovernorGeneral, inter aiia, that in pursuance of Section 61 of the Constitution the Minister for Minerals and Energy be authorised to borrow for temporary purposes a sum in the currency of the United States of America not exceeding the equivalent of $4000m and to determine on behalf of Australia the terms and conditions of the borrowing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That statement indicates his naivete and his failure to comprehend the struggle for the conservation and preservation of the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We now have a Federal Government which talks about returning issues of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who lives near Port Phillip Bay, anybody who has to travel by Melbourne transport, anybody who lives in the Dandenongs or anybody who lives in the Westernport region knows, if he thinks about it, that the idea of there being no Federal influence in what takes place in his area environmentally and the matter being left to the State Government is absolute rubbish as a political proposition <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past 20 years of Liberal Government many changes have taken place; but in the area of public expenditure, in the area of public responsibility accepted by both the Liberal Party and the Labor Partymatters such as transport, education, health, care of old persons, the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and so on- there has been really nothing which anybody, I believe, could report with pride as a matter of political management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While such fields as defence, foreign affairs and some areas of national resources and trade are logically handled nationally, I feel that the Commonwealth should reduce its interest in such fields as health, housing, education and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development whether he recalls answering a question from  Senator Mulvihill  concerning assistance to conservation bodies seeking to place evidence before environmental inquiries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister indicate whether the Friends of the Earth organisation is receiving sufficient assistance to allow it to present a full submission to the Ranger environmental inquiry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Affairs acknowledge that the establishment of a new university in the Albury-Wodonga decentralisation project is regarded by the AlburyWodonga Development Corporation and by the local community as vital to the success of the scheme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development: As there is a continual need for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in this country, will the Minister state what is the policy in relation to federal funding of both the national park lands acquisition program and the Australian Heritage Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Government’s policy for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is quite clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As I am sure  Senator Mulvihill  has ascertained, it refers to land use planning, to adequate research, to the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to the promotion of Australia’s heritage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A program of financial assistance was instituted by the previous Government for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and for the promotion of Australia’s heritage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 understand that when the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Senator Greenwood)  delivered the second reading speech on these Bills he moved that so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as to permit the Bills to go through all their stages without delay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If any honourable senator or any citizen believes that the Commonwealth police have acted unlawfully or improperly, the courts are open to them- as my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development said yesterday- and I think he also said that legal aid is also available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I note that the Government is proposing to consult with the States to work out an appropriate basis of co-operation not only for particular industries but also for protection of the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that for the reasons I have given the problem is much greater than one simply concerning particular industries or the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those of us who have regard for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> were encouraged by the assurance given in the other place that mining would not proceed until after  Mr Justice  Fox had completed his investigations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development will recall saying yesterday that continuing financial assistance for growth centres was now under review despite the Government’s assurance during the election campaign that, if elected, it would continue commitments entered into by the Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Senator Greenwood),  who is also a member of this chamber, is not uttering one word of opposition to the Minister in another place who is selling the minerals of this country wholesale in the nearest auction room and wrecking the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: Is it not surprising that the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Authority of Victoria, which some years ago was charged with the function of preventing marine pollution, did not make this discovery? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that Mordialloc Creek flows into Port Phillip Bay which is, of course, connected with Bass Strait and in view of the High Court decision in the Seas and Submerged Lands Act case, I ask the Minister whether in his capacity as Federal Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> he would be prepared to assist the Hamer Government to deal with the problem of pollution in Mordialloc Creek? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, will the 1 7.5 million constitute the ideal population base for Australia in terms of resource utilisation, exploitation and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will involve consideration of immigration, decentralisation and environmental policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The second consideration involves a discussion of the ideal population figure for Australiaideal both in relation to resource utilisation and economic growth and in terms of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The conference declared as its first principle that man had the fundamental right to freedom, equality and adequate conditions of life in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> of quality, permitting a life of dignity and wellbeing with a solemn responsibility to protect and improve the <span class="highlight">environment</span> for present and future generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I gave the general assurance that, overall, the Government has a keen interest in all the environmental impacts on the question of uranium but that we would wait for the Ranger report as the Australian Council of Trade Unions will do in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development has provided the following answer to the honourable senators question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-48-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were cuts in expenditure on construction, the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, housing, education and many other areas about which we all know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find that almost all government interest in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is gone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the care of children; transport needs, perhaps above all needs in the country; the development of reasonable urban facilities and the preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are appropriate matters for discussion, decision and initiative by the national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The areas in which these cuts of $ 1,300m will fallwhatever else there is to come- were outlined by  Mr Lynch  and include <span class="highlight">environment</span>, housing, community development, transport, construction, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be reined in on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and on regional development, on those things which the Labor Government tried to do to ensure that no longer would there be vast agglomerations of people in this huge continent living in a few square miles, with all of the problems that come from a large urban area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the specific assurance given by both  Senator Carrick  and the Minister he represents that there would be a very close examination of all environmental hazards associated with the impact of the Concorde aircraft on Australian skies before a decision was made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fair to say that no greater environmental impact study could have been made than that which was carried out in the United States where in recent years an immense study has been done into the whole technical and technological factors involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is significant to note that as a result of that study no environmental factors of any imperative nature had been raised in America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am unaware of any adverse <span class="highlight">environment</span> factors at all arising out of that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On behalf of the Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development and for the information of honourable senators, I present an urban paper entitled  A Report on the Information and Library Needs of the Citizens of the Western Region of Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The water functions of the former Departments of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and the Northern Territory were transferred to the Department of National Resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Senator Greenwood)  explained in his second reading speech that the Bill replaced the existing provisions with a new system of valuation based on the internationally recognised Brussels definition of value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also inform the Senate that the Minister for Repatriation,  Mr Newman,  is acting as Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mindful of the unfortunate illness of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, I ask: Did either  Mr MacKellar  or  Mr Newman  jointly evaluate those reports with  Mr Nixon  or was it entirely, as I suspect,  Mr Nixon’s  show? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to respond, wearing 2 representative cloaks- transport and <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that the environmental impact statement was made by the British Government itself, that in its preparation and in the whole of its journey up to the drafting stage, which we understand is its final stage, there was continuous association between this Government and the British Government, and that that knowledge was available to both departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the impact study itself can be taken as having been done on the broad lines that are now accepted internationally- thank goodness- as standard by governments in preparing these kinds of statements; and that the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development can be taken to have been associated with that investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that both departments received submissions from the public and from environmentalists, and evaluated them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Essentially the report rests on the British environmental impact statement, together with the 2 streams of testing that have been done in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will allow existing organisations to adapt to the new <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they will be in competition with Medibank and to develop their own arrangements to monitor usage in cooperation with the medical profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provisions will assist in creating an <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which health maintenance organisations might successfully operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Australia in common with other medium and smaller countries is now facing a more difficult task in developing foreign policy in a deeply disturbing world <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From our own point of view the primary concern is an international <span class="highlight">environment</span> which could progressively limit the capacities of Australia, her friends, and allies, to advance their interests and ideals, which reduce options, which almost imperceptibly weakens the capacity to pursue our interests and advance the cause of human dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although our capacities to advance our interests are limited we should be active and constructive in pursuit of a peaceful and favourable international <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister agree with the main thrust of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> tabled yesterday that the Australian Government should maintain a continuing attack on air pollution in Australia and that it should co-operate with other countries in order to keep a close watch on upper atmosphere pollution on a global basis? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On behalf of the people of Sydney and all the sporting writers who have plugged this theme, I hope we will get some tangible evidence that the Minister for Administrative Services has got in touch with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  and said: ‘Eastern Command has to find another area for the Engineers depot at Moore Park’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development see a report in  The Australian  on Wednesday, 21 July 1976, headed  Boycott Team has Eyes on Brisbane Games,  in which  Mr Ram  Samy VicePresident of the South African Non-racial Olympic Committee, stated that a group of Londoners, most of them exiles from South Africa, organised the Montreal Olympic Games walkout by representatives of some African countries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another problem that I believe the Commission had is that the welfare field in general and the social security field in general does not only involve the Department of Social Security but also involves departments dealing with education, housing, the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, urban and regional development and in particular the Attorney-General’s Department in respect of legal aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In very simple language I raised with the then Australian Government Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, the Prime Minister and the appropriate State Ministers what this migratory bird treaty meant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also ascertained from other circles that before he left Australia he asked the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development what he could say to the Japanese since Japan and Australia were co-signatories to the migratory bird treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is of no little significance, I believe, that this examination was undertaken by one of the Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committees of the Senate, namely, the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose, too, that one of the harmonious ways I can recall in which the Committee worked was when the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> ceased to exist and reappeared in the form of a new committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development give assurances that the fear of subsidy strangulation that is held by major conservation groups is unfounded and that such groups who operate as environmental vigilantes will not have their operations curbed in the face of mounting mining industry pressures? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Radio station 2KA which is a component of the Federation of Commercial Broadcasters- I think the station is called ‘The Voice of the Mountains’could look a little beyond the blinkers which seem to encompass it and say: ‘We recognise that there is a case for protecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and we will find other land’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will direct the attention of my colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development in another place, to the question asked by the honourable senator and, specifically, to the final part of his question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, follows an earlier question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Has the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development noted recent reports that air pollution levels in Sydney and Adelaide have exceeded safety levels recommended by the World Health Organisation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister ask his colleague in the other place to list this subject on the agenda for discussion with State <span class="highlight">environment</span> Ministers at the next meeting of the Australian Environmental Council, if that is the appropriate forum, with the object of introducing appropriate legislation in the States and the Commonwealth to deal with this important matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the Labor Government’s administration the IAC was obliged to have regard to the desire of the Government- a Labor Government was in power when this legislation was pursued in Parliament in 1973- in pursuing the general objectives of national economic and social policy and urban and regional development, to improve and promote the well-being of the people of Australia, with full employment, stability in the general level of prices, viability in external economic relations, conservation of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> and rising living standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How many journalists were employed in the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, and in commissions and statutory bodies under the Minister’s control, at 1 September 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-14">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question in relation to Fraser Island to either the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development or the Minister responsible for export licences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of those comments, 1 ask the Minister to refer the matter to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development or to the Minister for Primary Industry for examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The implementation of legislation relating to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is not one for my Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a matter for the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, which is under the supervision of another Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is quite a part of the research into environmental matters and indeed it is part of the world investigation into this problem of air pollution and pollution of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think that a question relating to the implementation of legislation concerning the <span class="highlight">environment</span> should be addressed to another Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After the Liberal Party returned to government he became Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  mastery of detail and his allround competence were clearly displayed in the important and onerous portfolios that he administered- Health, Attorney-General and, in the brief period before his illness, <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was followed by his assumption of the most difficult portfolio of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, to which he was completely unaccustomed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to  Senator Carrick  as Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and refer to the action I took last Thursday in furnishing him with a telegram from the Fraser Island Defence Organisation which implied that the existing mining agreement was being breached and which the Minister undertook to check with both the Minister for National Resources and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter is being examined by the Department of National Resources in consultation with the Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government will be concerned, pending its consideration of the final report of the Fraser Island environmental inquiry, to ensure the maintenance of the environmental safeguards previously adopted in relation to exports of D.M. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also it would not wish to pre-empt the final report of the environmental inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development indicate whether any, and if so what, inquiry or investigation into the Australian Government’s role in and support for sport is proceeding? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has a proper <span class="highlight">environment</span> impact inquiry been held into the major woodchip industry at Coffs Harbour? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Federal Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development been involved in any environmental impact assessment of this proposal to date? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, has the Minister’s attention been drawn to a report on page 3 of today’s  Sydney Morning Herald  in an article entitled Woodchips Showdown Today’ that the Federal Government is withdrawing from the field of environmental impact inquiries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The desire to come to Australia is based on economic return rather than a desire to transfer themselves from the Christmas Island <span class="highlight">environment</span> to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this sort of situation, when the economic difference is so great, these people would prefer to come to Australia rather than to return to their own community <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are generally happier there and would prefer that situation to a situation of considerable difficulty in an Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Australia accepted this territory, or bought this territory in order to exploit it, perhaps we might think of the booby birds alone and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the island alone and accept our responsibility to that part of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever we may do in Canberra- irrespective of which government is in power either in Canberra or in the States- when it finally comes down to the local <span class="highlight">environment</span>, it is the local council that makes or breaks the area which it represents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then as a fourth interest we have the representatives of the community who are basically the recipients or the clients and who themselves have a vested interest in creating a society or an <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 2 1 September in answer to  Senator Walters  I stated that the Government had given block grants to the States, announcing that it placed emphasis on the development of community based health services and, at the same time, the Commonwealth Government expressed its concern to promote its policies in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> where it wants Commonwealth involvement in the supervision of the expenditure of money by the States kept to a minimum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the first report made public by the Fox Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry it was indicated that, while the green light was given for the mining and milling of uranium in Australia under certain conditions, the mining of uranium in the Northern Territory could not be commenced until the second part of the report was made public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mindful of the caution shown by  Mr Justice  Fox in his interim report about any uranium extraction in the Northern Territory, will the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development and the Minister for the Northern Territory exercise the power mentioned by  Senator Carrick  during Estimates Committee discussion to declare the boundaries of the Kakadu National Park before- I emphasise before’- any future uranium extraction is attempted in the Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that the Minister for the Northern Territory and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development have agreed that Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory is of national significance and at the appropriate time should be declared under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that although the commissioners were not required to do so by their terms of reference they pointed out in the first report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry that they had been asked to suggest where the boundaries of the National Park should be, having in mind proposed and possible mining operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development will have regard to the suggestions of the commissioners and will have further discussions with the Minister for the Northern Territory before defining the boundaries and declaring Kakadu National Park under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no doubt that eventually, if the Department of Science gears itself correctly and the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development supports it, our experts will become the leading experts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What he found by looking at the reproductive organs of male grey teal in the MurrayDarling area revealed evidence of remarkable adaptation to its <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the first understanding of the species’ eccentric life cycle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the following two years he was blessed with good luck; floods in 1956 and then drought in 1957 pro.vided him with further evidence of how duck had adapted to their unpredictable <span class="highlight">environment</span> to ensure the continuation of their species. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are we to accept this incredible statement by  Mr Newman,  the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, in a newspaper which I do not think anybody in his wildest imagination would accuse of having any slight leaning to the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has appointed a Minister for Housing who has other responsibilities, particularly for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and community development, which at the moment are very onerous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The housing allowance voucher experiment was announced by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  soon after he’ took over the portfolio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development has talked about the housing allowance voucher scheme as being the brave new world, the great new initiative in housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The allowance is described as a series of regular, periodic payments made directly to a family or eligible individual unable to afford a decent home in a suitable living <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am mindful that Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation forestry experts have given evidence before the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister would know that one of the most trusted officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development,  Dr McMichael,  at various times has been under attack from misguided people even when the Government was trying to control grazing in the Mount Kosciusko State Park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Stringent conditions should be imposed upon the lending of Federal money to ensure that forestry management procedures designed to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are strictly observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development has provided the following information that is relevant to this question and also to questions 1062 and 1063 asked by the honourable senator, answers to which I have already provided: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-64-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth and the States have been concerned at possible effects of certain chemicals on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and, through the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council (AEC), joint action is being taken to develop recommendations on appropriate control measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-64-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition the AEC has recently decided to develop recommendations on comprehensive policy measures for the assessment and control of environmentally hazardous chemicals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-64-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This decision is strongly supported by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development Consultations are being initiated between Commonwealth departments covering environmental, health, agricultural and other relevant interests to develop a co-ordinated input to this activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-64-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of further claims that these dumps present a health hazard, will the Minister ask his colleague in the other place, either the Minister for Defence or the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, to make a public statement on the matter in order to dispel the concern that has been expressed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that he was referring to this project in particular but he made the general comment, and I think that there would be general agreement with the comment, that in the past many water conservation projects have been spawned in haste without any real investigation as to results which might flow- not just the economic results but especially the environmental ones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate would be well aware that the creation of a fresh water inland sea such as the one on the Ord in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> which has a 6-month dry season naturally will change the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On occasions people interested in the medical side have raised questions as to how the change in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> might affect the health of the people in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The special techniques appropriate to a tropical <span class="highlight">environment</span> need to be used before the full benefits of that scheme will come into being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, these matters have destroyed the sort of consensus which was being worked for and they have destroyed it in a totally different and worse economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> from the one which prevailed at the beginning of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many countries have hydroelectricity, but they are fortunate countries which have the <span class="highlight">environment</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look around the world and see how many countries have such an <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well to look at the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>, but in the European <span class="highlight">environment</span> some countries have only three or four hours of sunshine on the days when they really require energy- when it is cold, when homes need heating, when industry needs to be kept going and when more lighting is required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any doubt that anybody still has about that attitude should be dispelled by the comments made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development,  Mr Newman,  in the third paragraph of his statement when he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fate of these, and the manner and extent to which man and other biota in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> may be subjected to them are important matters on which some information has been sought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In setting effective anti-pollution safeguards not only is the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protected but mining companies immediately know the standards which they must maintain and will know if and when they can operate so removing speculation from their activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential that mining companies can move in a predictable <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which to make decisions and that governments do not leave them (up in the air) as to their rights and obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development,  Mr Newman,  and to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations,  Mr Street:  ‘Well, now, how do we know that with radon everything will be all right? ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This flies directly in the face of the major Fox recommendation and refutes the claims of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  who stated that he agreed with all the Fox recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate, on 28 November 1974, resolved that there be referred to the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> the following matter: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Impact on the Austraiian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> of the current Woodchip Industry Program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> embarked upon an investigation of this reference during the Autumn Session of Parliament 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 25 March 1976, in terms identical to the original resolution, the Senate resolved that the matter of the environmental impact of the woodchip industry be referred to the Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> created on 2 March this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total environmental impact of woodchip operations cannot be fully assessed at this time because of the large number of inadequately researched factors to be taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Empirical observations, coupled with experience and some research, tend to indicate that in the sort term, present operations in relatively restricted areas are acceptable provided environmental prescriptions are observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee accordingly considers that no new projects involving the clear felling of forests specifically for woodchips should be started until such time as the doubts concerning long term effects on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> can be resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Australian Atomic Energy Commission plan to prepare an evironmental impact statement under the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protections (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, relating to its intention to build a new reactor at  Lucas  Heights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-61">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act would apply to any proposal by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission to build a new reactor at Lucas Heights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-61">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I further ask: If the letter indicates that the Minister is advocating that the Federal Government break its election promises on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and on Aboriginal affairs in order to push ahead with uranium mining in the Northern Territory, does not this pre-empt any recommendations which may be made by the second report of the Fox inquiry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770426_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development: In view of the apparent lack of housing for rehabilitation purposes through the women’s refuges, can the Minister say whether pressure can be put on the States to give priority in allocation of welfare housing to the clients of the refuges? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because all relevant environmental matters have been dealt with in the working group and steering committee reports previously undertaken, these will constitute the environmental impact statement which is required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770428_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On 25 February 1977  (Hansard,  page 445)  Senator Colston  asked me a question without notice concerning a report in the  Australian Financial Review  of 6 December 1976 that  Dr George  Heinsohn, a Senior Lecturer in Zoology at James Cook University, had called for a study of the effects upon the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> of shark meshing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-39-17">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the current report of that Department features the role of the present Government on air quality and general air monitoring, I ask: Was the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development consulted by the Minister for Transport on the decision to reduce car and truck exhaust emission standards? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that in a week or two when we are perhaps discussing the energy crisis or the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> it will be brought to our attention by contributors to those debates that the motor car is not necessarily the greatest benefaction that has been inflicted on Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that we have to look at it not only in relation to roads but also we have to consider that commerce, industry, housing, <span class="highlight">environment</span> and, most of all, people, are all part of the problem of the car. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The comment was made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman),  who has the responsibility for this legislation, that this debate reveals in this House, as it did in the House of Representatives, that the Government and the Opposition are united in one resolve, and that is that aged people must be helped to the greatest extent possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is characteristic of Australia that introduced pests, vermin and plants have a tremendous capacity to flourish here when in their own <span class="highlight">environment</span> they tend not to flourish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I present the final report and the transcript of evidence from the Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> on its inquiry into the impact on the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the current woodchip industry program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate, on 28 November 1974, resolved that the matter of the impact on the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the current woodchip industry program be referred to the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 2 March 1976 the Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> was created and on 25 March the Senate resolved that the matter of the environmental impact of the woodchip industry be referred to the new Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Chairman  of the new Committee I was fortunate in having as fellow committee members, 3 senators who had served on the former Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Committee and who accordingly brought a large measure of continuity to the ongoing inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conformity with its terms of reference, the Committee concentrated its attention on the immediate environmental impact of woodchip programs, that is to say, the impact on soil, air and water and on forest fauna and flora. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The impact on the social <span class="highlight">environment</span> has received consideration also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To recapitulate, the Committee concludes that whilst a number of environmental problems exist, curtailment of the woodchip industry program is not warranted on environmental grounds at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearfelling for woodchips poses a number of threats to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other environmental threats, notably those relating to soil nutrients, wildlife preservation, and conservation of genetic characteristics, are less well understood and require further research to identify their true nature and magnitude and to determine ways to counter them effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the abovementioned environmental threats, any indiscriminate extension of clearfelling for woodchips outside the boundaries of present concession and licence areas would be viewed with concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee is not satisfied the forestry authorities are doing all that could reasonably be expected in the way of ensuring that management prescriptions for protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are being correctly implemented in the forest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Schemes to make economic use of sawmill waste and silvicultural residues including thinnings from existing sawlog operations have environmental as well as economic benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee is concerned at the potential for environmental damage represented by the present absence of control over felling operations in private forests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total environmental impact of woodchip operations cannot be fully assessed at this time because of the large number of inadequately researched factors to be taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Empirical observations coupled with experience and some research tend to indicate that, in the short term, present operations in relatively restricted areas are acceptable provided environmental prescriptions are observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee accordingly considers that no new projects involving the clearfelling of forests specifically for woodchips should be started until such time as the doubts concerning long term effects on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> can be resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It gives me a good deal of pleasure to endorse the remarks of the  Chairman  of the Senate Select Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we can get unanimity of purpose we will save much of our present <span class="highlight">environment</span> and avoid mistakes that were made notably at Eden in the early years of the woodchip industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It related to the present policy of this Government to more or less wind up the vision of former Ministers for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Dr Moss  Cass and  Mr Berinson,  about the Australian Government having its own national parks and wildlife service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The changing <span class="highlight">environment</span> for manufacturing in Australia is in part an aspect of the world-wide process of change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A major part of the White Paper is devoted to ways of generating a wider and fuller understanding in the community of the significance of the changing <span class="highlight">environment</span> for Australian manufacturing industry and to means of establishing through consultation a general acceptance of how to respond to these changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In today’s circumstances and in the changing <span class="highlight">environment</span> now being encountered, Australian manufacturing industry, over a reasonable period of time, needs to adjust towards a greater degree of specialisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be preferable for them to be resettled in another country or to be sustained in a more suitable <span class="highlight">environment</span>, through the UNHCR. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the interests of those refugees who, it is assessed, would have extreme difficulty in adjusting to the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> may not be best served by migration to Australia but be better served by action by the UNHCR or other agencies to resettle them in a more compatible <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for National Resources or, alternatively, the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development aware that, as reported in the  Herald  of 2 1 March 1977, Australia recycles only a small fraction of used automotive and other lubricating oils and that most of the used oil is either dumped or burned, often with adverse environmental effects? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-76-63">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Although the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act was assented to on 17 December 1974, the Administrative Procedures under this Act were not notified in the  Gazette  until 24 June 197S. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-41-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:  () To 16 June 1977, 10 194 applications were received under the Homes Savings Grant Act 1976 since its commencement on 1 January. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recognising that the provision of Australian uranium to the world nuclear fuel cycle creates problems relevant to Australian sovereignty, the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the economic welfare of our people, and the rights and well being of the Aboriginal people: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Believing that (having regard to the present unresolved economic, social, biological, genetic, environmental, and technical problems associated with the mining of uranium and the development of nuclear power, and in particular to the proven contribution of the nuclear power industry to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased risk of nuclear war; and the absence of procedures for the storage and disposal of radioactive wastes to ensure that any danger posed by such wastes to human life and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is eliminated), <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To sum up, considerably more detailed ecological studies are required to determine the pathways -followed by radionuclides once they are released to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The second report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry which deals with environmental aspects states that under certain conditions of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> we can export uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No decision will be made on mining until we are absolutely satisfied that the needs and interests of the Aboriginal people are safeguarded and that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is also fully protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I support the mining of uranium I also support the need for a thorough inquiry and discussion by the Government and those concerned to make sure that the socioeconomic well-being of the Aboriginals as well as the <span class="highlight">environment</span> will be given serious consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On top of this, all rehabilitative work with regard to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> would be done by the operators at their expense and also under certain standards which could be upgraded and subject to review the whole time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fox report said that there must be assured protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> at the expense of the person who was mining, and that the obligation on the operator to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> must be legally enforceable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was said that the performance of the obligation must be fully secured before any mine was opened; that a trust fund or bond must be provided for anybody or anything that may be damaged by the mining; that there must be firm and legally binding undertakings to replace the tailings in the pits and that no relaxation of those bindings must be allowed under any circumstances; that the tailing dams must be sealed by an impervious membrane; that steps must be taken to reduce the loss of yellowcake dust; that the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> must be assured if mines were to go into liquidation or for any reason were to terminate their operation; that the Government should immediately explore what steps it can take to assist in reducing the hazards, the dangers and the problems associated with the production of nuclear energy; and that a national energy policy should be developed and reviewed regularly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second report takes up all the aspects of the mining operations as it relates to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the tribal Aborigines in the area in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Furthermore, they can provide a repetitive or seasonal view thereby making it possible to detect slow changes to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> not readily visible by other means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s recent decision- upon which I will be putting down a statement at the end of Question Time- is to increase Australia’s activity in Antarctica and is prompted by two factors- the need to ensure the continuation of expeditions by replacing equipment, buildings and transport facilities as existing facilities deteriorate and in view of the increasing interest in exploiting the resources of Antarctica; to ensure that Australia is in a position to participate in the formulation of adequate guidelines for protecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> if and when exploitation occurs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In reply to  Senator Thomas,  the extensions to the scientific program are directed at increasing our understanding of the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> off the AAT. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential that if those resources are to be exploited it should be under conditions which will not adversely affect the unique Antarctic <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During this stage all the environmental aspects of the proposed development will be taken fully into account through the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection administrative procedures to ensure that the Commonwealth environmental legislation is complied with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An environmental impact statement will be required in time to enable it to be adequately examined prior to the granting of any production licence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concern is expressed sometimes about the establishment of such a petrochemical industry but many environmental impact statements have been carried out in relation to this complex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But all of the studies done with regard to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> have come out with a very clean bill of health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer that I received- this is the point I would like to raise with the relevant Minister- is quite at variance with the contents of a brief that I have been privileged to look at, a brief that was developed by the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the brief from the Depanment of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development set out the extent of the backlog, namely $4,000m throughout Australia and $850m in Perth alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, that answer is at variance with the information given in the brief by the Department for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Minister represents the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  I would not expect that he would be able to provide answers to the discrepancies that I have outlined this evening, but I do think they are important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation which assessed this statement noted the amount of technical detail supplied and advised that it was satisfied that the environmental issues of the proposal had been adequately covered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will operate as a series of integrated engineering systems, which provide isolation from the external <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Operation  or  the complex will have no detrimental effects on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has flowed from four fundamental considerations: the need to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation; the need to supply essential sources of energy to an energy deficient world; the need to protect effectively the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which mining development will take place; the need to ensure that proper provision is made for the welfare and interests of the Aboriginal people in the Alligator Rivers Region and of all other people living in the Region and working on the development projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In accepting the responsibility of further uranium development we will ensure that that development will be very strictly controlled, with the fullest and most effective protection for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the welfare of the Aboriginal people as recommended by the Ranger Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That mining operation was carried out with inadequate concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was an operation which reflected environmental attitudes of 25 years ago which Australians would not tolerate today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will be allowing further uranium development only where it is satisfied that strict regulation and control can properly protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the case of Koongarra, it was made clear by the Ranger Inquiry that there would be a considerable amount of planning and investigation to be completed particularly having in mind the fragility of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> which could be affected by development at Koongarra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that area to be declared in the subsequent stage of the National Park, exploration will be permitted in the meantime under strictly controlled conditions to be supervised by the Departments of National Resources, Aboriginal Affairs, Northern Territory and <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government is satisfied that the recommendations of this far-reaching and comprehensive public inquiry set out a basis on which mining and export can proceed in harmony with, and with full protection for, the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, national park and Aboriginal values. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I now want to announce the decisions which the Government has taken to ensure protection of the Australian public, preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and establishment of a major National Park in the Alligator Rivers region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In taking its decision on uranium mining, the National Park, and Aboriginal land rights, the Government has been guided by the two reports of the Ranger Environmental Inquiry commissioned under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly I have granted an exemption under the procedures of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To appoint a Supervising Scientist to coordinate <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection in the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In so doing I will show our commitment to the use of the best pollution control technology available in the world and to the adoption of stringent standards to protect people and their <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first finding of the Ranger Inquiry the Commissioners took the view that the environmental effects of uranium mining could be adequately regulated and controlled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is confident that decisions it has taken will provide the level of control necessary to ensure protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and I will return to this aspect later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If properly buried deep underground in geologically stable formations, there is little chance that these materials will re-enter the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in dangerous quantities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has taken a number of decisions to ensure nationwide protection of Australians and their <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim of this Code will be to protect the health and safety of citizens of this country by ensuring protection of their <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Inquiry has noted the environmental problems that resulted from uranium mining at Rum Jungle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognise that <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection measures at Rum Jungle could not be considered adequate by today’s standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is confident that the measures which I have announced today will ensure that current and future uranium mining undertaken anywhere in Australia will be subject to adequate <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection controls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As recommended, legislative action will be taken to enable the Director to enforce <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection provisions, particularly by way of injunction to restrain or compel action, and to give the Supreme Court a wide discretion as to the exercise of its jurisdiction in such cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will proceed to develop the rest of the park as quickly as possible; in the meantime its protection will be ensured through special control exercised jointly by the Departments of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, National Resources, Northern Territory and Aboriginal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Second Report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry recommended that <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection of the Alligator Rivers Region could be accomplished in two ways, of which the establishment of a major national park was the first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second element recommended by the Ranger Inquiry was the development of specific arrangements to protect the natural and historic features of the Alligator Rivers <span class="highlight">environment</span>, to protect the Aboriginal people who have lived there for centuries and to protect the mine workers and their families who will take up residence there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Inquiry recommended that the total level of activity in the region should be limited to minimise the impact on both the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> and on the lifestyle of the Aboriginal residents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has decided to appoint an officer, to be known as the Supervising Scientist, to exercise a supervisory and integrating role over all research and monitoring programs associated with environmental protection from the hazards of uranium development in the Alligator Rivers Region and to advise on the specific environmental requirements for the Ranger project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As recommended by the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry the Supervising Scientist will be responsible to myself as Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development and I hope to announce an appointment in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has confirmed that any proposals to develop further mines in the Region should be subject to the requirements of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act before any government decisions on these mines are taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before such decisions are taken the Government will need to be satisfied about the acceptability of the environmental impact on the Region of the development of the mine concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The application of the Act to other mining proposals in the Region will ensure that the Government will have all the facts on the environmental implications of these proposals when decisions on them are required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the national Minister concerned with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> I believe the thrust of the many recommendations of the Inquiry to be entirely consonant with proper environmental protection, and it will be clear from my statement today that the Government takes a similar view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will thereby ensure the protection of the Australian public including the Aboriginal people and our <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and will in so doing protect the Alligator Rivers Region with its rich archaeological sites, abundant wildlife, diverse and interesting vegetation, and exciting and beautiful scenery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman),  has in addition outlined the environmental controls to be adopted by the Government and he briefly referred to some of the health aspects of these. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Code deals with radiation protection aspects only and is not concerned with the other potential hazards or with the broader environmental issues already elaborated on by my colleage, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Code was accepted by both this and the previous Government and was submitted in the evidence my Department gave to the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has accepted and indeed gone further than this recommendation of the Ranger Inquiry and, as already indicated by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, the Code will be included in the Uniform National Code of Practice which will be established by the Commonwealth, with the States, by appropriate legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate will know that one of the responsibilities of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is to exert a continuing oversight of the problems of pollution in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Mulvihill, who is  Deputy Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, will be interested in the question of noise pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ordinance resulted from recommendations made by a sub-committee of an interdepartmental committee established to examine ways of protecting the quality of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second, the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council, was established in 1971 with the aim of promoting common standards on environmental matters throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Council is composed of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> Ministers from the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Existing divisions of the CSIRO, such as the Division of Atmospheric Physics or the Division of Environmental Mechanics, are active in the study of the influence of air pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, on behalf of the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council, instituted a national air monitoring program early in 1976 to develop a uniform air pollution monitoring program in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development purchased three mobile air pollution monitoring caravans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, the hazard from particulate lead has caused the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council to call for controls on the lead content of petrol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Close co-ordination by State bodies associated with urban development, <span class="highlight">environment</span> planning and pollution control is also vital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A notable and encouraging move in this direction was the recent creation of the New South Wales Planning and Environmental Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The foregoing discussion highlights some of the environmental effects that can accompany technological change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A multitude of new chemical substances is created each year for use in industry, agriculture and the home, with little thought or testing applied to any possible deleterious effects on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The passing into law of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974-75 has helped greatly in providing a basis for formalising environmental assessment requirements into statutory power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section 3 of this Act defines ‘<span class="highlight">environment</span>’ to include ‘all aspects of the surroundings of man, whether affecting him as an individual or in his social groupings’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a letter dated 14 September 1976 to the Senate Select Committee on Air Pollution from the Victorian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Authority the Acting Chairman stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is understood by the authority that the national air monitoring program is not on behalf of the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council as yet and the national air monitoring program has only been concerned with funding State programs to this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Page 9, (c)- The first paragraph is confusing and we are not aware of any work by the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council towards this end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that that is worthy of some comment but 1 believe that it is important to register and record the comments that have been brought forward by the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Authority of Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An examination of the potential threat to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by emissions from conventional power stations is rather interesting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said, the Leroc Company had trouble with the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is greatly deteriorating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet not a single prosecution has been brought against any major oil company for a breach of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Act because lead is emitted from chimney stacks as a result of the burning of fuel oil without a licence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further to that, in regard to the actions taken by the oil companies in blending the oil, the views of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development are worth recording. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Trade Practices Commission in its decision of 22 October 1976 quoted from a submission from the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development dated 20 February 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The submission stated:   as the most environmentally desirable method of disposing of used oil is by re-refining, it is essential for the interests of the independent oil re-refiners to be protected in any arrangement to co-ordinate the recovery of waste lubricating oil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the view of our own Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, and I think it adds to the point that we ought to have a policy from the Department of National Resources on what we are going to do to achieve the results mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interests of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>, we must ensure that it is done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The concern of the Australian forces has been to conduct a demanding technical operation in the physically, and meteorologically hazardous <span class="highlight">environment</span> which eventually claimed the RAAF helicopter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague in the other place,  Mr Killen,  further adds that the Australian Government has most warmly appreciated the unstinted co-operation of the Indonesian authorities in the search and rescue operation following the helicopter crash and generally in assisting Australian survey personnel in carrying out their task in an extremely difficult physical <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is about a subject that would also encompass the responsibilities of the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can the Prime Minister and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development claim that safe methods of disposal and storage of nuclear waste materials are available in the light of that congressional report? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This is not just a matter for my colleague, the Minister for National Resources; it also impinges upon the jurisdiction of my colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now ask: Are there any powers in the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act under which the Ranger mining company directors could be gaoled if there is any defilement of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the park? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has also announced its intention to amend the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act to enable the Director of National Parks and Wildlife to enforce <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection provisions by way of injunction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, upon notice, on 16 August 1977: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The seasonally adjusted figures just released by the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development of the number of housing loan approvals for the period June 1976 to June 1977 demonstrate a strong growth in the number of loans transacted by permanent building societies whilst concurrently the trading and savings banks have experienced zero or negative rates of growth in loan approvals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was euphoric, of course, in that <span class="highlight">environment</span> but he should recognise within himself that this was the least that he could expect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Am I correct in saying that in the proceedings of Estimates Committee C the Minister and his officers asserted that the present environmental impact statement code is the same as under Ministers Cass and Berinson? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the answer is in the affirmative, can the Minister assure me that the residual powers of the Government in relation to the banning of exports where environmental procedures are not followed have been retained? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is one bipartisan understanding in this Senate and in Australia it is that the Commonwealth has power over exports and can use it if it wishes to enforce its policies, whether on <span class="highlight">environment</span> or on other matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It now needs only the approval ofthe Federal Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as the strategic matters I have referred to, we also take into consideration factors of our physical <span class="highlight">environment</span>, technological developments and developments in methods of waging war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular another confidential document published in the  Australian Financial Review  a couple of weeks ago showed that the Liberal Party in fact has decided not to mention the alleged economic benefits of uranium mining at all because it is terrified of a public backlash against the implication that the Liberal Party is prepared to jeopardise the entire global <span class="highlight">environment</span> for a grubby dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To maximise the contribution of an expanded and socially acceptable nuclear program which is consistent with the maintenance of a safe <span class="highlight">environment</span> in terms of solving problems of health and security which may arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any views I have on this question were reinforced last week during the sitting of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> when we heard evidence from people in the coal industry who are regarded as being responsible in the area of research as well as other facets of the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether Clutha and Utah came along and bleated, but I am going to insist that some of those rajahs of the American capitalist system from Clutha and Utah be asked to testify before the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again refer to the evidence taken by the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather ironic that in this sort of economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> the Government has the audacity to be talking about, contemplating, suggesting or floating the rumour that a Federal election will be held in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government cannot stop the business sector of the community speculating and expressing concern at the present economic <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will have consequences for the whole financial <span class="highlight">environment</span> and is directly contrary to the Government’s promise of lower interest rates- an undertaking that was made or implied earlier this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the opening of a fund raising function to send our team to the Moscow Olympics- I think it was in Melbourne- the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This organisation is well worthy of the support of the Government, and I trust that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman),  under whose ministry it operates, having seen the wonderful work which the League does and the problems which confront the organisations and persons in areas bordering the river, will recommend the reintroduction of the grant which was taken away in the previous Budget and has not been restored in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The broad thrust of the report that the  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> brought down can be compared with studying from a Mount Olympus type vantage point what has happened in regard to water pollution and air pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact, each time that the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has dealt with the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development generally there has been some reference to the funding by the Australian Government of certain pollution monitoring appliances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the main purpose of the observations made by the  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> was that we must have constantly a greater degree of co-ordination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The plain fact of the matter is that the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> was hampered in the taking of evidence because a regular controversy was going on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be in a much better position to answer the honourable senator’s interjection if I could get better answers to my questions on this matter from the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a long time there was inactivity between the States and the Minister responsible for <span class="highlight">environment</span> in a host of fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Often in the process, a State Minister moves from the <span class="highlight">environment</span> portfolio or a State government changes its political complexion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to  Senator Carrick  as Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The problem of unemployment is not overlooked, but it is felt that any significant and lasting improvement in this area can best be achieved through the restoration of a stable economic <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I supose what’s really necessary is that we all take two years without a wage increase, but I can’t see that happening within the present Australian political <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the moment I wish to refer to the management of the Ayers Rock-Mount Olga National Park and to the fourth report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether it was the change in <span class="highlight">environment</span> but there was an alteration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The apportionment of each State’s allocation between the State housing authority and the Home Builders’ Account of the State is determined by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community after consultation with the House Minister of the State concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is of tremendous importance, especially in an area which concerns our <span class="highlight">environment</span>- in this case the area of air pollution- that we monitor the situation year by year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a great need to adjust the community’s thinking, so that people will consider reducing the impact of pollution upon the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and upon our quality of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that sort of <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the question of solar energy ought to be considered but I become very concerned when I read certain predictions as to what is going to happen by the year 1990. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> does not go far enough in emphasising the need for more intensified research in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The development of agricultural waste and forest production to provide raw materials for processing complexes producing liquid fuel is a prospect which suits Australia’s climate and its industrial research and development <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps one could say that the report and the Senate’s having the Science and <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Committee look at this particular issue, was prompted by the concern expressed by many conservationists, environmentalists and others on this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They included environmentalists, conservationists and people in and outside the industry itself; there were foresters and many others, and after spending much time in the field, and hearing evidence, the report was brought in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can make available to people, whether Aborigines or not, opportunities for better education and health facilities, but unless their children can come home to a decent home with an <span class="highlight">environment</span> where they can sit down and do their homework, it is all to no avail;  so housing is  a very important factor for consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I agreed with a large portion of it, especially when he put a case for the use of alternative forms of energy, a reduction of impact upon the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, and the improvement of the quality of our life, with less dependence upon fuels which damage and pollute the atmosphere upon which we depend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I found this material of interest to me because, as honourable senators are aware, I have just completed an inquiry into the woodchip industry and the effects of woodchip and forestry generally on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This aspect was highlighted during the examination made by the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> ofthe woodchip industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government would be very well served in the current political <span class="highlight">environment</span> if the responsible Minister did as he can do; that is, inquire of the Australian Broadcasting Commissioners, none of whom has considered this matter of the removal of this program, whether they might review the decision which has been made by the Victorian management eschelon presumably with the approval of  Mr Keith  Mackriell, the Director of Radio Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been advised by my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development in another place, that his Department has taken this problem very seriously; that it is in communication with the Norwegian <span class="highlight">environment</span> ministry and other sources of information in relation to the Ekofisk oil spill in the North Sea; and that his Department is being kept progressively informed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By way of preface I refer to evidence given before the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> inquiry into the woodchip industry that the main threat to forestry was die back, a fungus emanating from Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Faced with the prospect of exploitation, the nations with an active interest in the Antarctic, including Australia, will have added responsibilities to ensure that the Antarctic <span class="highlight">environment</span> is protected as activity there increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that the statement attempts in rather muted terms to marry <span class="highlight">environment</span> with development, and in that area I think the report might have been a little more specific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He referred to the marriage between science and industry but I hope that when the report of the Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is finalised we will not have a shot gun marriage between some of the elements involved in the industrial scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The continuation of the scheme in 1978 at the 1977 levels of support will allow the export industry further time to adjust to the very difficult economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which circumstances have placed it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the first function should be to inform new settlers from ethnic communities, which have no organisations or only very small organisations, about their new <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the Australian way of life, the availability of services and to teach them English, which I feel is very important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will be aware that the Commonwealth’s role in respect to protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation is essentially concerned with national policies, and that the States have the authority and the responsibility for the development and implementation of programs that deal with environmental issues at the grass roots level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In most cases it is the States that have the legislative powers to monitor and enforce environmental standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The role of the Commonwealth is to assist the States as far as possible and as far as is desirable in providing the means for co-ordination of policies for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will know that there are councils comprised of Commonwealth and State Ministers through which common standards and common policies in respect to issues relating to conservation and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are debated and decided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A recent initiative pursued by the Government through the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council is the decision to move towards comprehensive and co-ordinated regulation for the export and import of environmentally hazardous chemicals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The responsible State and Commonwealth Ministers have agreed to the establishment of a national body to assess the environmental effects of potentially hazardous chemicals and to recommend the appropriate controls to Federal and State authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some years now the Commonwealth has also taken the lead in providing special purpose grants to the States to assist them in undertaking activities within a variety of <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it is a standing piece of legislation that will be available to provide a proper and convenient means for the Commonwealth to assist the States financially in respect to matters relating to the’ <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for the Minister to agree with a State upon financial assistance and, acting jointly with the appropriate State Minister, to approve projects relating to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in essence a simple Bill, but it is, nevertheless, a significant policy decision which emphasises again the Government’s concern to work co-operatively with the States, through well established means in the interests of responsible and rational management of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development is based on a Press release of 5 February by the new Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development pledging total <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection for the Alligator Rivers region in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can we avoid the vision splendid of the Kakadu Park being involved with a series of mining enclaves which will destroy the whole concept, quite apart from increasing the environmental difficulties? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps I can help the honourable senator in this way: As he will know the Government has decided to allow the Ranger project to proceed on the basis of the environmental controls recommended by the Ranger Inquiry, that is the Fox report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has also decided that development of other new mines in the Alligator Rivers region should take place only when the requirements of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 have been complied with in each case and the Government is fully satisfied as to the acceptability of the impact of the development on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the Aboriginal people, having regard for the region as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the stage 2 area the Government has decided to bring the area under special control exercised by the Departments of Aboriginal Affairs; <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development; Trade and Resources, and the Northern Territory and that there will be no exploration, development or mining within the area without the authority of the Commonwealth and that all measures will be taken for the advancement of Aboriginal welfare within that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps this is because there is a greater awareness in the community of the trade offs that are made in a Budget contextmore assistance can only be accorded at the expense of expenditure on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, health, social welfare, defence … or through higher taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-In view of the lengthy discussions with British and Australian scientists about nuclear waste in the Maralinga region of South Australia, I ask the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development whether the British Government has indicated that it is prepared to accept responsibility for the disposal of that waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Governor-General’s Speech contained many features relating to priorities, economic policies, rural communities, social policies, civil rights, <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the sciences and all these matters will find expression in the various legislative measures that will be brought forward in this session and discussed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>policies which are followed almost ipso facto in Australia, will fail to be relevant to the economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the 1970s and 1980s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since, for various technical, strategic and political reasons, pre-emption is not a viable policy for Australia, the <span class="highlight">environment</span> for future Australian military operations becomes the Australian continent, its off-shore island territories, and its air and maritime approaches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These would include the selection of new personnel, promotion, training, organisation, the allocation of tasks within branches and departments, the attendance time policy, the administration of safety, health and welfare policies, and the development of the work <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because I mentioned the basis upon which exchange programs will be developed in Australia, I should say that in the coming year Australian science will direct much of its efforts into the fields of energy and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, areas which have dominated the headlines of this decade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We apparently live in a time of increasing awareness in the community of the fact that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is not indefinitely resilient in the face of abuse and that the well being of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is inextricably linked with our own future good health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, they might have much wider implications than just the effect of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My friend  Senator Bonnor  probably would agree with me that they had a rather idyllic civilisation in those days, but nobody seriously contends that we shoud go back to those times and that sort of <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will be relying heavily upon a document entitled ‘Furnishing Industry Workforce: Its Future in a Changing Economic <span class="highlight">Environment</span> ‘, which is a submission made to the Australian Government and the Industries Assistance Commission in March this year by  Mr K.

    <p>When that task is inadequately defined, a high probability of preventing a failure in the given operational <span class="highlight">environment</span> is the only basis of analysis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The continuing oversight of the problems of pollution, including ways and means of preserving the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from pollution; and the recommending, as soon as possible, of what further measures might be taken to overcome the problems revealed by the reports of the Senate Select Committees on Air Pollution and Water Pollution, and which measures, if any, should be taken urgently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last year the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> visited the Lower Molonglo water quality control plant in Canberra, and I think that all honourable senators should take time to inspect that facility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to be confident that when we arrive at one of these highfalutin agreements between a State and the Commonwealth we will be considering not merely what is involved in satisfying water needs but also the attendant need to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fourth subject on which I wish to speak relates to environmental matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not wish to deal at great length with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> because  Senator Davidson  and  Senator Jessop,  who are far more experienced and knowledgeable in this area than I, have made fine contributions in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that I do not spend a great deal of time discussing environmental matters does not lessen in my mind the importance of that subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and industries which are very much dependent upon water and in the protection of the conditions under which livestock exist, it is necessary to give a very high priority to these water resources projects, even if we have to limit expenditure in other directions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to take up time by reading the definition in detail, but it refers to the conservation of water resources or the water <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the management of water quality, the distribution or reticulation of water, the drainage and desalinisation of agricultural land, or the mitigation of flooding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The building of dams in the south-west of Western Australia could have a disastrous effect on the already fragile <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implications of all this cannot be stressed enough when we consider a statement printed on page 23 of a document emanating from the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, entitled  An Evaluation of The Dartmouth Project, April 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It also suggested that existing examination and quarantine measures for imported live fish and their containers are insufficient to give reasonable assurance of exclusion from Australia of exotic plants and animals which could have an adverse impact upon the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The nature of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> at Woomera is such that it is expected that it will be some time before the full environmental implications of military use of Woomera will be known and final decision made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is necessary for people to be identified to come into the building, if it is necessary for people to be identified as they move from point to point, is it further necessary that in the place in which they work whether it be the refreshment rooms, an office or the Senate itself, they should display their identification as though they were inmates in a prison or a similar <span class="highlight">environment</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Government has committed itself to protecting the health and safety of the people and <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Australia from possible harmful effects associated with nuclear activities in Australia and as the description ‘nuclear activity’ figures in government statements on these matters, can the Minister advise the Senate of the way in which the term ‘nuclear activity’ is defined by the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-As Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, I seek leave to make a statement on behalf of the Committee concerning its recent visit to the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Five members of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> visited the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern Territory between 20 and 22 March 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The visit was undertaken in pursuance of the Committee ‘s reference relating to the continuing scrutiny of problems of pollution, including ways and means of preserving the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Motivation for the visit at this time sprang from a reply on 22 February 1978 by  Senator Carrick,  in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman),  to a question by  Senator Mulvihill  about the Kakadu National Park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major topic of discussion was the scope and content of the management plan for the proposed Kakadu National Park and the way in which that would make provision to meet various potential environmental hazards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee stresses that firm dedicated and unambiguous management of the park is essential for successful protection of the Region’s <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-by leave- Members of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> who went on the field expedition endorse the sentiments expressed by the  Chairman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Carrick will recall that during an Estimates committee hearing about two years ago it was stated that, broadly, the final arbiters in a dispute between mining companies and conservationalists were the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and the Minister for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My understanding is that if money is required to make the area more secure or to provide a better <span class="highlight">environment</span> now that the ore has been removed from its rightful place, money would be forthcoming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A whole host of other things, including the preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, were to be looked after. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that last August the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development stated that strict environmental controls and standards in relation to uranium mining would be adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard the Government is presently examining the nature of environmental requirements, consistent with the environmental controls agreed on by the Government last August, that would be included in the grant of a mining authority to the Ranger consortium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will carry legal force and will, of course, be subject to supervision by the supervising authorities in the region and subject also to the oversight and co-ordination processes established in the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill 1 978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As indicated by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, provision is being made in the Bill to amend the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act to protect wildlife and natural features in the Stage 2 area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to meeting Aboriginal interest in the area and the necessary environmental controls, the Government will be proceeding with a tightly-controlled exploration programme so that the resources of the Stage 2 area can be identified and appropriate action taken as quickly as possible to enable the proclamation of the area as a national park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first committee of which I was a member was the Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare, and the next was the Senate Standing Committee on the Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, which looked into the environmental conditions of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and into the protection of their sacred sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are the urban fire brigades in the major cities and ports in Tasmania sufficiently equipped to deal with outbreaks of fire on vessels which not only could affect the lives and the cargoes on the vessels concerned but also could affect drastically the port facilities, lives and the general <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ex gratia payments to the mining companies are conditional upon rehabilitation of mined areas to the satisfaction of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes; the responsibility for rehabilitation aspects rests with my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This matter mainly falls within the responsibility of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Extensive scientific investigations by overseas authorities have been evaluated by appropriate expert committees in Australia and is has been judged that the currently approved uses of phenoxy-acid herbicides including 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, do not represent a hazard to health or the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Furthermore, it is well recognised that the merino sheep is the product of and is particularly adapted to the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> and it has reached that stage through many generations of selection for the particular circumstances to which stud masters adapt their sheep. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I could go on to refer to some of the more outrageous treatment given migant groups in the Press, let me say that the Government is not entirely innocent of creating the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which the Press can write that sort of story. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> when investigating the woodchip problem and its effects on forest products found it necessary to probe so many of the assertions that are made and the views that are held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I earlier used the word ‘incentives’ and it is worth noting that the Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, in its report on the woodchip industry, advocated the use of a carrot to promote the expansion of private forests of different timbers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is significant that former  Senator Everett  has played a role on Tasmanian committees in taking on board some of the findings of our own Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and translating those findings to State level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The State of Michigan at the turn of the last century had a number of areas that had been overcut but with skilful government management and with the co-operation of private forestry operators it was able to reverse some of the ill-fated attempts to create farmland where it should never have been attemped From evidence given to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, which delved into the woodchip industry, I am aware of some of the ill-fated attempts in Victoria to create farmland, of the way in which the <span class="highlight">environment</span> was raped, of the way in which forests were pillaged and of what followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the Tasmanian Minister for Mines, Forests and <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, also the Hydro Electric Commission,  Mr Andrew  Lowrey, is considering, is in effect tearing up the existing Acts and starting again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 1975 House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation reported on the softwood forest agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the appropriate committee to make a reasonably expeditious inquiry into this subject would be a committee of this chamber which already has looked at matters associated with softwood plantings in Australia, that is, the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, which last year produced a report dealing particularly with the woodchip industry in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, after the Opposition’s amendment has been dealt with- I indicate now that for the reasons I have mentioned I will not be supporting the Opposition’s amendmentI propose to move that this Bill be referred to the Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> for a report as soon as possible but not later than 25 August 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will close on that note and make this final plea to the Government: That it take the initiative, under the legislation that is available to it, to ensure that before the project is proceeded with every possible safeguard in terms of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, foreign investment, immigration, and any other aspect that is to the benefit of Australia is properly investigated and safeguarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another concept I do not want to see developed anywhere in Australia is the concept of Australians being denied the right to benefits from and enjoy their <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The company would have the responsibility of ensuring that no adverse environmental effects resulted from the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important for  Senator Keeffe  to note that on 1 3 January this year the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  issued an order requiring the company to produce an acceptable environmental impact study. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important thing is that the Commonwealth Government has acted in this respect and the company is apparently working on the environmental impact study which is expected to be ready by mid- June. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So on two thrusts the matter has come on to the Federal Government’s plate- on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> thrust and on the question of foreign investment and its implications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The governments of Australia, Commonwealth and State, have between them complete power to decide how any land, any project or any aspect of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> shall be managed for the future, so if this project is developed complete control over it lies with the elected governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not for me as a Minister at this distance to evaluate the pluses or minuses of the project and it is not for anyone else to do so without a knowledge of the environmental impact study, without a knowledge of the report from the Foreign Investment Review Board and without knowing what are basically the terms of the agreement with the Queensland Government and what is in the small print as to the nature of the undertaking, the involvement of the Australian people, whether it will be something that will create substantial employment for Australians and whether it can attract considerable tourism to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that  Senator Jessop  in his capacity as  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committe on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> would be particularly interested in this matter, and rightly so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780505_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill  1978 <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these Bills, the Government gives evidence of its determination to strike a responsible balance between economic development and the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1975 an Inquiry was instituted under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, into the proposal by the Ranger Consortium to develop uranium deposits at its site, some 200 km east of Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fundamentally, the Inquiry was designed to provide a basis on which the Government could take responsible decisions for environmental protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Commission was appointed to inquire, and here I quote from its Terms of Reference in respect of all the environmental aspects of: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Second Report contained recommendations on measures to ensure that the necessary degree of environmental protection was provided over the full period of uranium mining developments in the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As announced last August, the Government decided that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Region would be protected from the consequences of uranium mining through a series of actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To appoint a Supervising Scientist to coordinate <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection in the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The functions of the Supervising Scientist are set out at Clause 5, and as honourable senators will see, his role is basically threefold: The first is to collect data on the effects on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Region of uranium mining operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is concerned with the development and promotion of standards, practices and procedures for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and with measures for protection and restoration of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third main function is to co-ordinate and supervise the implementation of requirements for environmental protection under prescribed instruments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The functions of the Co-ordinating Committee are essentially to assist the Supervising Scientist in his role of protecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from the effects of uranium mining operations in the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will consider and recommend programs for the collection of data, consider and keep under review standards, practices, procedures and measures for environmental protection and restoration, and keep under review requirements, and their implementation, under prescribed instruments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Co-ordinating Committee is the focal point of the system proposed by the Government for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from the consequences of uranium mining operations in the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The role of the Co-ordinating Committee is to provide a forum and a mechanism for these interests and organisations to communicate, consult, consider and reach understandings and agreements on the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be the task of the Supervising Scientist, presiding at meetings of the Co-ordinating Committee, to obtain comprehensive and coordinated advice and recommendations which take account of all interests and which have as their primary objective the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from uranium mining in the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development to undertake preliminary functions of the proposed Supervising Scientist, steps have already been taken to establish monitoring of base-line environmental conditions in the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using temporary field laboratories, a significant amount of work has already been undertaken to establish a data base for later development of environmental protection programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, I believe this Bill and the Bills that follow demonstrate the Government’s determination to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Region, and to safeguard the interests of people in the Northern Territory and elsewhere in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is the second in the package of three Bills under the portfolio of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development which the Government has decided to introduce as part of its policy for uranium mining developments in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill which I have just introduced dealt with scientific institutions and arrangements- the establishment of an Office of a Supervising Scientist and a Scientific Research Institute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aboriginals, with their long involvement with and concern for the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> have a key role to play in park management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague, the Attorney-General, will be introducing a Bill to confer jurisdiction on the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, in relation to the enforcement by it of certain legal requirements for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in relation to uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers Region, at the suit of the Director of National Parks and Wildlife, or the appropriate Land Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable Senators will note that the definition of the Region in this Bill differs from that contained in the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill which I have already introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certain provisions in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill, the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Bill are related to this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The establishment of Kakadu National Park is indicative of this Government’s concern for the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> and Aboriginal interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Highly skilled and innovative persons sensitive to the special requirements of the Aboriginal people and sensitive to the unique nature of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Alligator Rivers Region will be needed to ensure the success of the Government’s intentions in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Bill <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Bill is to confer jurisdiction on the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in relation to the enforcement by it of certain legal requirements for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Alligator Rivers Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry saw the Director of National Parks and Wildlife and the Northern Land Council as having a special interest in reinforcing the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection machinery in the Alligator Rivers Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It saw as an advantage of the recommendations it made with regard to Aboriginal ownership of land and the creation of the national park that there would be people with the interest and knowledge to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from the consequences of mining operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Inquiry therefore recommended that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection provisions be made legally enforceable and that both the Director of National Parks and Wildlife and the Northern Land Council be given the right to enforce those provisions, particularly by way of injunction to restrain or compel action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also provides that the Court may order the repayment of costs incurred in work to remedy any detriment to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, this Bill, together with the related Bills which are being introduced, are a further earnest of the Government’s determination that the development of uranium mining in Australia will be carefully controlled and proceed in a responsible manner with Full regard to the need for protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the welfare of all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978 <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object of this Bill is to establish mechanisms for protecting the health and safety of the people of Australia, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, from possible harmful effects of nuclear activities here in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will enable governments to ensure that the nuclear industry in Australia is so regulated as to afford the utmost protection to people and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should emphasise that this legislation is concerned with health and safety of people, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, as distinct from safeguards, the purpose of which is to ensure that nuclear material in peaceful use is not diverted to nonpeaceful purposes or to nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should any unforeseen situation arise as a result of a nuclear activity, which is not regulated or controlled by a Commonwealth, State or Territory law, and which is likely to affect health, safety or the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the GovernorGeneral will have power, under clause 1 3 of the Bill, to authorise the appropriate Federal Minister to act to control hazards associated with the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is our judgment, after considering all relevant factors, that a contingency provision of this nature is a proper and responsible discharge of our duty to provide for the health and safety of people in Australia, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Orders made under the provisions of this clause have effect only in relation to situations likely to affect health and safety, or the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, that arises from nuclear activities, as defined in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally, we would see the steps involved in arriving at approved codes of practice as including: initial drafting by the appropriate Commonwealth Department (for example Department of Health for health codes, Department of Transport for transport codes, Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development for general <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection codes); consultation on the proposed draft code with relevant State and Territory Ministers; the release, where appropriate, of the draft code for public comment, particularly by in dustry and Trade Unions; consideration of the draft code by relevant Advisory Councils such as the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council; final consideration within the Government and submission to the Governor-General; the provision of an order in writing by the Governor-General approving the code; tabling of the order approving the code of practice in both Houses of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, in concluding I want to emphasise that this Bill is designed solely to protect Australians and their <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is responsible environmental legislation that will provide for the development of protection measures in respect to nuclear activities in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This body of eminent non-government professional people has already played a most significant part in advising the Government on the effects of the various actual and potential sources of ionising radiation exposure on the Australian population and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation demonstrates very clearly our determination to see that uranium development in Australia is regulated and controlled to ensure the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the health and safety of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I refer the attention of the Minister representing the Minister  for  <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development to an answer given by the Minister yesterday in the  Other  place which appears on page 1957 of the House of Representatives  Hansard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, which carried out an inquiry during the period 1974 to 1 975- at the time of the Whitlam Labor Governmenton the operation of the first two forestry softwood agreements also expressed concern in its report about the lack of research available to the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That concern which was expressed by the FORWOOD conference and also by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation led to the Bureau of Agricultural Economics conducting a study of the industry, the report of which was finally published in 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether it should be the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources or the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> I do not know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we were to go along with the idea of referring this Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> or to the National Resources Committee, we would not achieve our purpose because no mention of new plantings is made in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I am making is that the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, of which  Senator Townley  and  Senator Mulvihill  were members, in regard to taxation incentives have not been implemented by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the report on the woodchip industry by the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> which is headed by my colleague  Senator Jessop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators who served on the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> when it inquired into the woodchip industry would agree with me that a much longer term is required to report on any reference relating to the forestry and timber industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development will recall that yesterday I asked him a question concerning the Great Barrier Reef and oil drilling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New sections are to be inserted after section 23 of the principal Act to empower any person authorised by the land council to obtain information and documents relating either to uranium mining operations in the Alligator Rivers Region or to the applications made by the lands council to the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory concerning matters affecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Alligator Rivers Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This amending legislation protects mining interests from disclosing incriminating material concerning environmental protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions protect the power of corporate secrecy and make Aborigines impotent to challenge a company if it considers that disclosing its technical information might tend to incriminate it in regard to the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will damage the <span class="highlight">environment</span> totally and completely as they did in the Rum Jungle area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that somewhere along the line before these Bills are finished with, the Minister will explain what safeguards were used in transferring the ore from Rum Jungle to Snake Creek and whether there is any danger to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> or human beings in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will also oppose and seek to amend the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said at the beginning, I am not going to say very much about the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In brief, the amendments are, firstly, to necessitate a public inquiry before the confirmation of the nuclear codes; secondly, to establish an environmental protection advisory council independent of government control; and, thirdly, to require that codes not be confirmed until after public inquiry and findings have been reported to the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the reasons I have stated with regard to the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill, it is quite clear that the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill should be rejected by the Senate, particularly in view of the fact that three and a half years ago Liberal and National Country Party senators rejected regulations made under the Act on the grounds that it was improper to use an Act rooted in the defence powers of the Commonwealth for commercial purposes, and the regulations were disallowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is with pleasure that I enter the debate on the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill, which the Senate is debating concurrently with the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The environmentalists, who are sincere on this issue, will point out to  Senator Walsh  and to others that the use of coal can be more damaging to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> than the use of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I do not support the present form of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill or the Environmental Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the proposed amendments is to give the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly some involvement in <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection and some control of parks and wildlife in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are certainly terribly conscious of the preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People with expertise are employed by the mining companies to do all they possibly can to preserve the very valuable <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Senate this afternoon is debating two Bills cognately- the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill 1 978 and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleagues on this side of the chamber who will follow me in this debate no doubt will speak on that Bill as well but will speak also on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I went with the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an area of great significance to the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This afternoon we are debating a Bill to amend the Atomic Energy Act and also the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This package of legislation deals, as I said, with amendments to the Atomic Energy Act, with aspects of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Alligator Rivers region where the mines are situated, and with Aboriginal land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They even cover aspects of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the Government on these two Bills, the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill 1978 and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second Bill, the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill, is mainly a machinery Bill which will allow us, when the mines commence, to lay down certain regulations under which the rnining operations can take place and which will allow for safeguards, for the men working there and those who would be involved down the line in transport and other ancillaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is more, the reactors operated in the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> for 1 50,000 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Senate is debating the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  shall turn briefly to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The stated purpose of this Bill is ‘to provide for a code of practice so that nuclear activities are effectively controlled throughout the country in the interests of health, safety and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it specifies ‘in the interests of health, safety and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the provisions of this Bill go far wider than questions of health, safety and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before  I  was interrupted I was dealing with the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must understand that the Parliament operates in a society in which there should be freedom of discussion and debate on these matters and that persons involved in that process of freedom of discussion and debate should not be subjected to the sort of pernicious powers which are available to the Government under the Atomic Energy Act and which will be available to the Government if the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill is passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second Bill which the Senate is debating this evening is the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It simply enables the creation of codes designed to protect the health and safety of the people of Australia and to protect the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> from possible harmful effects of nuclear activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill is simply an enabling Bill designed to enable Australians and Australia to be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He alleged that the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill goes beyond the protection of the health and safety of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object of this Act is to make provision, within the limits of the powers of the Parliament, for protecting the health and safety of the people of Australia, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, from possible harmful effects associated with nuclear activities in Australia, and this Act and the regulations shall be construed and administered accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further to the Prime Minister ‘s letter of 3 1 August 1 977, 1 understand the Prime Minister will shortly send you a draft copy of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It says that the Minister may authorise a person to issue any orders the Minister considers necessary to control or to eliminate any hazards, assumed or otherwise, to the health or the safety of persons or the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from any nuclear activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it turned out, all six States objected to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The States maintain objections to the amendments to the Atomic Energy Act similar to those they have in respect of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three of the States have been quite specific in restricting their remarks to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In consequence of the failure of the Commonwealth to consult with the States, the Prime Minister announced that he would amend the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill in a minor way, namely, by delaying the proclamation of key sections of the Bill until further consultation had taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought to take into account the damage being done to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by conventional power stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so something like 5 tonnes of carbon dioxide and many kilos of nitrous oxides are liberated to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These create tremendous environmental problems which are not evident from nuclear power stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nuclear power stations pose no threat to the atmospheric <span class="highlight">environment</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are liberating all this carbon dioxide to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> which is increasing, slowly but surely, the temperature of our close <span class="highlight">environment</span> to a degree-  Senator Coleman  says she is worried about life- which will necessitate serious contemplation in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a serious environmental threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the nitrous oxides and other gases that are liberated from conventional power stations pursue a course which takes them to the ozone area and would endanger the environmental shield and increase the threat to life in this world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill does nothing to protect or safeguard human health or safety or to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two Bills now being debated cognately are the Atomic Energy Amendment BUI and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill or the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill protect that intimacy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said already that these Bills will not even protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can there be protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> with the mining of uranium? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take this opportunity,  Mr President,  to draw your attention to Part HI of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill, which is grandiosely entitled ‘Codes of Practice’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paragraph (a) states that it may:  specify standards to bc observed, practices and procedures to be followed and measures (including measures for or in relation to the restoration of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from the effects of nuclear activities) to be taken with respect to nuclear activities; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We observe that clauses 11 and 13 of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill have come in for some comment from the Opposition and from some State Premiers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extended period meant that the Lands, Planning and <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Committee of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly had time to complete its own examination of the proposals and to report to the Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take part in this debate very conscious of the fact that the Government assumes that the Bills- the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill 1978 and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978- will establish mechanisms for protecting the health and safety of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a document entitled ‘Conclusions and Recommendations of Report “Nuclear Power Costs” <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Energy and Natural Resources Sub-Committee of Committee on Government Operations, United States Congress’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill, the government would be empowered to declare codes of practice to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and health and safety of Australians from the effects of uranium mining and other nuclear activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, clause 14(1) (d) of this bill ensures that the government can suppress any information relating to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, health and safety standards at uranium mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill leaves it to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span> to decide whether the public will have a chance to comment on proposed health, safety and environmental codes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The presentation of this legislation is a cynical exercise which has little to do with health, safety, the <span class="highlight">environment</span> or nuclear safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill overrides several powers now exercised by the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek your support and co-operation in deferring the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill and the Atomic Energy Act Amendment Bill until full and proper consultations have taken place at the Premiers Conference due on June 22. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We strongly urge you to oppose the passage of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill and the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill when they come before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our technology is not yet sufficiently advanced to deal with all the known effects on human health and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of nuclear energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Radon is one of the rare gases, without chemical properties, and the only way to remove it from the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is to freeze it out with a coolant like liquid air. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst on the one hand mouthing pious sentiments about the need for consultation between State and Federal governments before codes are proclaimed or enforced, the Government has so worded the clauses of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill and the amendments to the Atomic Energy Act that, in fact, the States have no rights at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clauses 8 and 11 of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill are cases in point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not in the slightest degree equipped by education or experience to pass a judgment upon the issues to which  Senator Haines-  adopting the views of others as well as speaking for herselfhas referred with so much concern but I have tried to follow them and I have formed my own judgment in the light of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry and the debates that have been held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill 1978 and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978 that are before us disclose a real concern although that may only be in deference to a significant section of public opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will refer only to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978 which I will call the ‘code’ Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So clause 9 inserts into the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill these provisions which, to the unsceptical would induce the first blush. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proposed section 13 in Part V- Miscellaneous- of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill provides: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the health or safety of persons, or the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, is likely to be harmed by a situation resulting from a nuclear activity that exists in a State or Territory: and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>CSIRO research will support such community interests as the better protection of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>, flora and fauna, and consumer interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that I believe that the findings of the independent inquiry into CSIRO have vindicated this Government’s practice of minimising bureaucratic influence on scientific research and providing the proper <span class="highlight">environment</span> for innovation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978 purports to provide uniformity in all States and Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 refer to clauses 12 and 14 of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill, to which  Senator Wright  referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the <span class="highlight">environment</span> surrounding the operations of the CES has changed considerably since its formal establishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly it involves achieving a sustained reduction in inflation and creating the <span class="highlight">environment</span> both internally and externally for an expansion in the private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Senate is debating the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill 1 978 and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that anyone listening to the debate in this chamber or elsewhere tonight would not have been aware that he was talking about the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill and the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill, which are two important subjects to Australia that do not figure in his dissertation at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me refer first to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill which is an unusual piece of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object of this Act is to make provision, within the limits of the powers of the Parliament, for protecting the health and safety of the people of Australia, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, from possible harmful effects associated with nuclear activities in Australia, and this Act and the regulations shall be construed and administered accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 1 3 of the Bill gives powers to the Governor-General to deal with special situations if he is satisfied that the health or safety of persons, or the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, are likely to be harmed by a situation resulting from a nuclear activity that exists in a State or Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I have some concern about the results and the effectiveness of this particular <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill which is being dealt with in this debate jointly with the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate is debating the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill 1 978 and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978 conjointly, to which the Opposition has moved the following amendment: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such questions arise with particular force in relation to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill and the proposed amendments to the Atomic Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To requests by State governments for withdrawal of the legislation to enable reconsideration, the Prime Minister has responded that sections 1 1 and 13 of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill, should not commence in relation to the States until the views of the States have been considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Trade and Resources, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, the Department of National Development and the Department of Health are all concerned with aspects of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite that, I am not in favour of the legislation which is before us- the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill- being passed through the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Senate has been debating at length two Bills, the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill 1978 and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978, and I thank honourable senators for their contributions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the background of these Bills, it is worth reminding the Senate that last year the people and the Parliament had before them the results of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry in two volumes, styled the First and Second Reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second Bill, the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes ) Bill 1 978, is an important Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This second Bill proposes to establish measures to protect the health and safety of the people and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from possible harmful effects of nuclear activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government clearly intends to proceed with the mining of uranium regardless of the consequences to health, the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the Aboriginal people and their aspirations for land rights, civil liberties and world peace and security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been defeated just now in our major opposition to the Government’s intention but we continue our opposition in respect of the three Bills before the Senate at this stage- the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligators Rivers Region) Bill, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our opposition to these Bills is based on the assertion that the Bills purport to provide machinery by which the environmental and health consequences of mining can be regulated and their most destructive consequences contained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, the Australian Labor Party, the Opposition, has several major objectives in this matter: Firstly, the prevention of mining; secondly the securing of Aboriginal land rights in an unqualified manner; thirdly, the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>; and, fourthly, the protection of the health of this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to the first Bill, the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It expressed uncertainty about the types, amounts and chemical forms of mine pollutants; in the <span class="highlight">environment</span>; changes in toxicity of contaminants with time or place; sensitivity of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> to toxic substances; and effects of other non-toxic factors such as eutrophication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be clear to the Senate that such constructions and facilities could and probably would endanger the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in many ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The treaty will include further provisions relating to the Protected Zone which will cover agreed principles, parallel measures to be taken by, and co-operation between, the two governments to provide for the following matters: (a) the protection and preservation of the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>; (b) the management and conservation of fisheries resources; (c) the protection of plant and animal life; and (d) the prevention and control of pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The treaty will incorporate further provisions relating to the Protected Zone which will cover agreed principles, parallel measures to be taken by, and cooperation between, the two Governments, to ensure: protection and preservation of the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>; management and conservation of fisheries resources; protection of indigenous flora and fauna (including endangered species, notably the dugong and certain species of turtle); prevention and control of pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition welcomes a number of the matters to be included in the treaty, particularly the co-operation between the two governments on mining and oil drilling, the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the magement of the resources in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that the answer is yes, but bear in mind that the overall codes of practice under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill will be drawn up as soon as possible and they will have an overriding impact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Northern Territory <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill deals with an area which will be almost exclusively Aboriginal land under the provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They spoil the <span class="highlight">environment</span> less than the white population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I and my Government share many of the goals and intentions of the Opposition of endeavouring to preserve the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to prevent despoliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to consider programs for research into, and programs for the collection and assessment of information relating to, the effects on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Alligator Rivers Region of uranium mining operations in the Region; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those duties are directed to looking after the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Alligator River, not the mining of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, since mining is to take place, and to ensure that the land is reclaimed after mining has ceased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not those who have an interest in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Alligator Rivers Region who are to be listed; rather it is those who have an interest in uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely they should be on the list of those eligible for appointment to an <span class="highlight">environment</span> co-ordinating advisory committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to ask: Are the mining companies protecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do they have documents which indicate they are not protecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the collection and assessment during that year of information relating to the effects on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Alligator Rivers Region of uranium mining operations in the Region; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He could state: ‘My comment is that XY deserves a bonus for particular efforts to preserve the <span class="highlight">environment</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to certain provisions contained in the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill the staff of the Supervising Scientist and the Supervising Scientist himself should not be exceptions to that requirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by inserting after the definition of ‘ranger’ in subsection (1 ) the following definition:  “Region” means so much of the Alligator Rivers Region, within the meaning of the definition of that Region in the  <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act  1978, as does not include- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Land in the Northern Territory, other than land in the Uluru (Ayers Rock-Mt Olga) National Park or in the Alligator Rivers Region as defined by the  <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act  1978, shall not, without the consent of the Territory, be acquired by the Commonwealth for the purposes of this Part if it is land that is dedicated or reserved under a law of the Territory for purposes related to nature conservation or the protection of areas of historical, archeological or geological importance or of areas having special significance in relation to Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To illustrate my point I refer to a matter that I discussed with  Senator Carrick  in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development during the Estimate committee hearings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the Estimates Committee hearings  Senator Carrick  admitted that it will be a king-sized job to try to make people conscious of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Radon is one of the rare gases, without chemical properties, and the only way to remove it from the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is to freeze it out with a coolant like liquid air. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Radon is the gas that will be released into the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Kakadu National Park when mining proceeds on these three leases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existence of these pastoral leases poses a further threat to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the National Park, for reasons which will be evident to the Senate and which have been discussed in detail in the Fox report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I proceed now to the third of this series of Bills which the Senate is now debating and that is the Bill relating to the enforcement by the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory of Australia of certain provisions for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Alligator Rivers region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to confer jurisdiction within the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in relation to the enforcement of the requirements for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do support the principle that a jurisdiction should be established in relation to the enforcement of certain legal requirements for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Alligator Rivers region, but we do not agree that this jurisdiction should be in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, it is our view that the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill should be in jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Australia, and one of my colleagues will explain our position on that at a later stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had the opportunity together with members of the Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> to discuss his role as he sees it in the supervision of this very important national park area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Bob  Fry, I believe, is well qualified to oversee environmental matters associated with the park and certainly with the mining that hopefully will be taking place in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know the gentleman personally and I can vouch for his integrity and his capacity to be able to deal with environmental matters associated with the Bills under discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From what  Mr Fry  has told me they will be comprehensive and will comprise personnel who will be very capable of dealing with matters and safeguarding the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Kakadu National Park region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was very impressed when I visited the Lucas Heights establishment of the Atomic Energy Commission to learn that the Commission itself has been studying the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Kakadu area over a period of years and certainly recognises the fragility of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, particularly in the wet season when the floods can occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It always amazes me that people tend to over-react in this situation because radon itself dissipates very rapidly in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and remains for only a very short period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do so because I believe that this Bill is lacking in National Park and <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never heard either the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  or the Minister for the Northern Territory  (Mr Adermann)  echo the sentiments of the present United States Secretary of the Interior, who has said that, whatever America’s fuel demands might be, wildlife refuges will not be mined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On one memorable occasion, when the Minister for Education took carriage of legislation dealing with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> he indicated to me- I accepted it in good faith- that the national view on the custody of the Kakadu National Park would prevail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that at that time the present Minister for National Development  (Mr Newman)  was Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fate of these, and the manner and extent to which man and other biota in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> may be subjected to them are important matters on which some information has been sought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In setting effective anti-pollution safeguards not only is the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protected but mining companies immediately know the standards which they must maintain and will know if and when they can operate so removing speculation from their acitivities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential that mining companies can move in a predictable <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which to make decisions and that governments do not leave them (up in the air) as to their rights and obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the chain of command- the co-ordinating committee- about which we are talking I would like to see the inclusion of a representative of the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that  Senator Carrick  would go in to bat for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development,  Mr Groom,  in the Cabinet discussions but I know enough about numbers to know what will happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even at this late stage I believe that the Government could at least have the  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> sitting in on the meetings of the proposed committee of Federal and State departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternatively, I would like to believe that the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> could have access to the minutes of this committee in case there is any general difference of opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This debate concerns three Bills that are all directly related to and associated with environmental protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the AtomicEnergy Amendment Bill and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the five Bills, there are three dealing with environmental matters, each covering specific areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, which is more localised, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill, which deals with much broader areas but which still deals with conservation and protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have heard the Opposition today express concern over many aspects of the proposed legislation, concern with regard to the risks of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have likewise laid down strong guidelines in these three Bills which, I repeat, deal with the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That plutonium, if released into the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, persists for a very long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My concern at the moment is that the community can be misled by statements about, as some people would put it, the lack of concern, where it is proposed to mine uranium in the Northern Territory, for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is doing all that it possibly can, as I said earlier, in regard to marketing by way of its guidelines, and in regard to mining and the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> generally in the area of the Northern Territory where that mining is to take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In dealing with the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, which concerns a local area, we can see very clearly just how much effort is being put into making sure that there will be environmental control and protection; that the Government will even go as far as to make sure that those activities are coordinated <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out that the Government had accepted responsibilities with regard to the overall aspects of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the whole uranium area in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that the Government was also very conscious of the need for <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection generally speaking and for safeguards and guidelines with respect to the sale of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has made sure that not only will it do all it can to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> but also it will enlist the right type of representation from this area to serve on the consultative committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only has the Government set up a consultative committee with a supervising scientist, to whom  Senator Jessop  referred this morning when he spoke to this legislation, but also it has gone further and set up a research institute to ensure that the work will not be purely observational but will involve research to make sure that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> both in the short and long terms will be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will make sure that there are strict environmental controls and safeguards generally in this region where mining is to take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As such it will be able to assess fully and watch closely the environmental impact in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the difference is that we are standing up and dealing with environmental aspects, openly saying that we are in favour of the mining of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of environmental protection, the Government is doing all that it can to make sure that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However in respect of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>,  Mrs Nobbs  in a letter to me stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a copy of correspondence dated 13 January 1978 from the  Deputy  Premier of South Australia, who is also the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> in that State, to  Mrs Nobbs  in which he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly the Department for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has permitted limited exploration . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are now talking about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the concern which is being expressed by a State government which has sent me and no doubt you,  Mr President,  as a South Australian senator, a telex criticising the Federal Government because the Federal Government is openly bringing in legislation to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and doing all it can to make sure that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now come to the interesting part of the letter from the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it does not contravene the Act, but who is in charge of changing the Act to make sure that it does if there is concern about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and about uranium? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me make it clear that we are discussing environmental aspects of the mining of uranium in the Ranger area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The South Australian Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has said that it should not significantly impair the quality of the ground water within the uranium ore body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Opposition is concerned about and what it is criticising us about is the lack of environmental safety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also researching a process which is a greater risk of polluting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> because of the underwater streams than anything that would take place in the Ranger area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the South Australian Government in turn to stand up as a government of this country and give support to a government in Canberra that is doing all it can to make sure that there will be environmental protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government has openly stated that it will mine and export uranium with stringent safeguards, both with regard to the sale of uranium and with regard to the conservation aspects of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will make sure that there will be protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> generally and at the same time make sure that we meet our international responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For one beautiful moment I thought he was in a fine fury because he was appalled at the fact that Aboriginal sacred sites were being polluted and that testing in connection with the mining of uranium in South Australia was endangering the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one of the main themes to have emerged from a 104-page report on nuclear energy which is soon to be released by the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Energy and Natural Resources SubCommittee of Congress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his second reading speech, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The diversity as well as making Ranger so interesting, implicates the problem of assessing the impact of any manmade disturbance to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not know what the <span class="highlight">environment</span> or the ecology is like before we start, yet the Government has drawn up Bills to protect them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can these Bills keep that part of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> free and clear when the miners themselves at this stage do not know where the dams will be built? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government cannot say that they will be in a safe place or that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> will be kept safe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are less than certain about so much of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also boggles at how man can go forward and endanger his own <span class="highlight">environment</span> in this unthinking, unknowing way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can we talk about preserving the <span class="highlight">environment</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why are we bringing in environmental Bills when we do not even know what the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is and we are not prepared to wait to find out? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know what has happened in other countries which have allowed the <span class="highlight">environment</span> to be polluted, but we are not going to learn by them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not doubt  Mr Fry’s  integrity but I doubt his ability to be evenhanded in the matter of dangers to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With all this pressure on the non-miners, if the Government’s stated concern about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is real, why has it not put any pressure on the miners? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that it is going to be impossible for them to mine uranium there without there being danger to the miners, to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to us all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am all for safeguarding the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I come from the Northern Territory and, with one or two exceptions, I support the Bills which are before us, namely, the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was interested to hear  Senator Melzer’s  comments about destroying the <span class="highlight">environment</span>- the animals, the people, et cetera. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it- I exclude the honourable senator from the expression I am about to use- that the ‘greenies’ are concentrating on the Northern Territory- the area in which, naturally, uranium will be mined- and ignoring the other parts of Australia where immense projects which are to take place will destroy the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and may result in ill-effects for the communities near those projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a very complex and complete plan of action in which the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is safeguarded and in which the mining and development of uranium is safeguarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are dealing today with three Bills- the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that  Senator Melzer  was a little hard on the companies in that area when she said they were doing all sorts of things and that nothing was being done to look after the ecology or the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has she seen the environmental surveys and plans that have been conducted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sort of thing is destroying the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, is it not? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today we are debating three Bills which are essentially environmental in nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill, and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Northern Territory Superme Court) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second Bill sets up mechanisms to ensure that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is protected in perpetuity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The third Bill- the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Billproposes to confer jurisdiction on the Supreme Court in the Northern Territory in relation to the enforcement by it of certain legal requirements for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Alligator Rivers Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Committee stage I shall be proposing amendments to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments underline our recognition of the role of the Northern Territory in respect of the powers and functions of the Supervising Scientist which are to be established under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two major decisions ofthe Government are, firstly, to proceed with the establishment of the Kakadu National Park and, secondly, to make special arrangements for the supervision of environmental protection measures in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill to amend the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act will facilitate the establishment of the Kakadu National Park, while the other Bill- the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill- will establish the environmental protection arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It needs to be remembered however, that the percentages related to those teachers working in a ‘special capacity’ in the Migrant and Multicultural education area and do not take into account teachers working in the ‘normal ‘classroom <span class="highlight">environment</span> who may have expertise in the education of migrant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer also to the following statement which was reported in the Melbourne  Age  of 20 May 1978 to have been made by  Mr Brian  Appleford, spokesman for the Friends of the Earth:   the Department of Primary Industry had insisted that the anti-whaling Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development be denied the right to make a separate submission to the inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Firstly, is it a fact that the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development is registered as or was announced to the International Whaling Commission as being one of the principal parties to the inquiry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My information is that the  chairman  of the inquiry,  Sir Sidney  Frost regards as principal parties the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, along with the Department of Primary Industry, Project Jonah, Cheynes Beach Whaling Company and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is dealt with in the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem is that if people, businesses or companies breach the enviromental protection measures outlined in the Bill in such a way as would be destructive to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, to the health of workers in the industry, or to the community generally, they may conceal that breach by claiming that the information which would establish it would lead to their incrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Supervising Scientist’ means the Supervising Scientist as defined in the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act 1978;. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Director is not entitled to maintain a suit by virtue of this section unless the matter in relation to which the requirement is sought to be enforced is a matter affecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in a part of the Alligator Rivers Region that is included in the area of a park, reserve or conservation zone under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After sub-clause (1), insert the following new subclauses: ( 1  a)  An organisation of persons, whether incorporated or not, shall be taken to have interests that are affected by uranium mining operations in the Region if concern with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Region is a matter included in the objects or purposes of the organisation or association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(IB)  Sub-section (Ia) does not apply in relation to a particular happening, incident or transaction occurring as part of uranium mining operations in the Region if the matter occurred before the organisation or association was formed or before the objects or purposes of the association included concern with the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More importantly, if the Law Reform Commission is to advise the Government as to the people who have a right of action in the realm of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, I put forward the enormous weakness in the Constitution of Australia whereby the right to object to unconstitutional expenditure of money is denied to anybody but the State Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Law Reform Commission is to be entrusted with the function of defining appropriate plaintiffs in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> sphere, I hope that its members will read in  Hansard  my expressions with regard to a deficiency of a much more important character whereby private individuals are not entitled to approach any court to declare unconstitutional appropriations which in fact are unconstitutional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that we are debating the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill which sets out to achieve in Australia a series of nuclear codes and practices to provide the highest possible safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against that background may I say that following correspondence between the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the States regarding the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill Commonwealth and State Ministers met in Canberra on 1 8 May of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that the discussions between officials indicated that the States were most concerned about two of the six Bills introduced into the Parliament last month- the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill and the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These amendments should not be seen as a weakening of the Government’s resolve to achieve, in co-operation with the States, effective and uniform regulation and control of nuclear activities insofar as those activities affect the health, safety and <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the health or safety of persons, or the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is likely to be harmed by a situation resulting from a nuclear activity that exists in a State or Territory; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the health or safety of persons, or the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, is likely to be harmed by a situation resulting from a nuclear activity that exists in a State or Territory; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the laws of the Commonwealth (other than this section) and of that State or Territory do not make provision for protecting the health or safety of persons likely to be affected by that situation, or for protecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> insofar as it is likely to be affected by that situation,  he may, by order, authorise a Minister, during the period that the order remains in force, to give such directions and take such action as, subject to sub-section (2), the Minister considers necessary to control and eliminate hazards associated with the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that the mining of uranium at Roxby Downs in South Australia might be detrimental to the whole of South Australiait might be detrimental to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to the health of the people- and the laws in South Australia do not provide the necessary protection, whether or not the laws of the Commonwealth provide the necessary protection, the Governor-General cannot do anything about it unless the State Government asks him to do something about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I used clause 13 as an illustration because it concerns safety and environmental protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I admit that I am not a legal man, these provisions may be necessary in accordance with constitutional rights, but if they are necessary we have to admit that the Commonwealth Government cannot protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from uranium mining unless we first get a uniform code of agreement which all States will observe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that what I have to say is relevant to clause 2, which deals with the coming into operation of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill, and to the amendment which has been moved by the Opposition as well as the Government’s proposed amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>shall cause to be furnished to the appropriate Minister of each State, and to the Minister for the time being administering the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 and, on and after1 July 1978, to the appropriate Minister for the Northern Territory and shall cause to be published in the  Gazette- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the Minister for the time being administering the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 is furnished with a proposed code of practice or a proposed variation of a code and an inquiry is currently in progress under the Act in respect of a proposed code or variation, the Minister may direct that the first-mentioned proposed code or variation be referred to the Commission conducting the inquiry, and the provisions of the Act shall apply as if that Commission was appointed to consider that proposed code or variation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major changes are precisely these: In the early part, which largely reproduces the clause as printed in the Bill, we seek to add a provision naming the Minister administering the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, so that he too will become directly involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We propose to establish an <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Advisory Council which is to be independent of government control, it being required further that no codes will be confirmed until there has been a public inquiry and the findings of that inquiry have been reported to the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment requires that there be an inquiry under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act on environmental aspects of every code. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an inquiry under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act were to be appropriate the Minister could direct it to be undertaken without the  need for this amendment to be adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There shall be an <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Activities) Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to advise the Minister with respect to any other matters relating to the protection of the health and safety of the people of Australia, and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, from possible harmful effects associated with nuclear activities in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After sub-clause ( 1 ), insert the following new sub-clause: ( 1a) The Governor-General shall not make an order under paragraph ( 1 ) (a) before the time at which the public inquiry to be held under sub-section 7 (2) or 7 (3) has reported its findings to the Minister for the time being  administering the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development been drawn to reports of the findings of a United States Congressional committee last week, which are set out in a document entitled  Nuclear Power Costs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purposes of the amendment were, firstly, to require that before the GovernorGeneral made any orders pertaining to the mining or milling of uranium there would have to be a public inquiry and, secondly that the findings of that public inquiry would have to be reported to the Minister administering the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Act of 1974 prior to any such order becoming operative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All honourable senators know that the whole thrust of the Labor Senate Opposition’s argument in the earlier weeks of the debate on the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill was that the Government had been recreant in not consulting the States and that it was imperative that the States should be consulted fully and their views sought and understood, presumably so that a consensus could be reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These amendments should not be seen as a weakening of the Government’s resolve to achieve, in co-operation with the States, effective and uniform regulation and control of nuclear activities insofar as those activities affect the health, safety and <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The purpose of the insertion of new Part IVa relates in a sense to a judicial and constitutional point which is simply this: Assuming the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978 is passed and proclaimed, the Commonwealth Government will be given paramount rights over the mining of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Bill 1978 will confer standing on several Commonwealth authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Missen  would like to enlarge upon that aspect, I can note it and draw the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  and the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  to any suggested defect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ) Where a situation exists where the health or safety of persons, or the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is likely to be harmed by a nuclear activity that exists in a State or Territory and the laws of the Commonwealth (other than this section) and of the State or Territory do not make provision for protecting the health or safety of persons likely to be affected by that situation or for protecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in so far as it is likely to be affected by that situation, the GovernorGeneral may, by order, authorize a Minister, during the period that the order remains in force, to give such directions and take such action as, subject to sub-section (2), arc strictly necessary to control and eliminate hazards associated with the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It arises from deficiencies in the present provisions of clause 13, which require, for example, that the Governor-General be satisfied that the health or safety of persons, or the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, is likely to be harmed by what is called a ‘situation ‘ resulting from a nuclear activity that exists in a State or Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Through the ages, as we became more industrialised and extended our agricultural and mining industries, little thought was given to proper conservation, to the effect of our actions on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, to trying to return the land to its original state after such development had taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We the undersigned Federal Members and Senators strongly urge the Federal Government to institute a public inquiry into the proposed $100m Iwasaki tourist resort at Yeppoon in Central Queensland under Section 11 ( 1 ) of the Federal <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On Thursday,  4  May a media release was issued by  Mr Ray  Harris, who is the  president  of the local <span class="highlight">environment</span> group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That policy was based on the findings and recommendations of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry conducted under the  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government’s policy is one of carefully regulated and controlled development having full regard to the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the welfare of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The development of those resources, whilst serving the objectives just mentioned, must also be regulated and controlled so as to ensure full protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the welfare of the Aboriginal people and yield the economic benefits to Australia and its people that were described in the report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was one of the issues which I thought was particularly important because the South Pacific region is fortunate in relation to environmental matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, many of the countries in the area have expressed concern about the environmental damage that might have been caused by French nuclear testing in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we dealt with this matter I was very pleased to find out that most of the countries involved were extremely aware of the environmental damage that could occur and also were extremely aware of the dangers that the French nuclear tests could pose for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand, tourism contributes to urbanisation, dependence on foreign goods, possible downgrading of island cultures, increased prostitution and possible misuse of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the South Pacific was raised also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We drew attention to the question of <span class="highlight">environment</span>, urbanisation and health- I think  Senator Sibraa  referred to health- and to the problems which sudden economic development could have upon the very distinct cultures of these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the concern expressed by the public and conservation organisations over aspects of the Wagerup and Worsley alumina projects, especially their impact on water resources in south-western Australia, is the Government considering the institution of a public inquiry into these environmental aspects in accordance with paragraph 7 of the administrative procedures under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My advice is that in accordance with the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, public comment is being sought on both proposals in the West. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development directed the preparation of an environmental impact statement in relation to this proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The facts of the situation, which the Government consistently chooses to ignore, make a mockery of the assertion on 26 June of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development,  Mr Groom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In another place the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development referred to what happens when interest rates are lowered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because of the way in which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  has expressed his views and because of the views expressed by  Senator Carrick  today, one can feel nothing but gloom about where the building industry is headed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is also a potential for differences of opinion within the mixed UN force in the highly volatile political <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which it will be placed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of living in decentralised areas of small population with easy access to an unsurpassed natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> we have not been angered by the unjust concentration of sumptuary incomes and wealth in the south-east mainland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development or it may more appropriately be addressed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that my colleague  Senator Jessop  and the members of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> have expressed the view that they want regular reports on what has happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that following the creation of the positions of Chief Scientist and his associates it was assumed that they would be keeping a very close watch on future operations from an environmental point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is very nice, but I like to believe that this Senate is the custodian of national resources and that the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is the particular watchdog. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This article refers to the fact that the sterile <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the modern large-scale piggery is causing very antisocial behaviour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development: Were 500 acres of Marina Plains station freeholded in 1974 or later with a plan for development as a tourist resort or as a possible area for mineral exploration? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have made some inquiries of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We rely on our scientists, much more than we care to admit, to foresee the problems of primary, secondary, manufacturing and tertiary industries as well as the effects their activities have on the ecology, the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and social aspects of our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not know what that means in terms of a Greek migrant child in the inner suburbs of Melbourne who is told that  Senator Carrick  is concerned about quality in education, but I know that it is very important for that Greek migrant child to have the benefit of multilingual teaching in the school, to have the benefit of teachers who can speak in his language and in that of his family, who can speak to his parents, and who can help him to assess his identity in a difficult situation and in a difficult <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I am trying to make is that society has changed very much since that time, the educational <span class="highlight">environment</span> has changed since then and there are very great difficulties in confronting the sorts of simplistic solutions which people, like  Senator Baume,  would probably like to advance in answer to some of these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have a feeling that the Government gave consent to the project without the necessary conditions of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development being met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s role, I believe, is the limited one of creating favourable environments in which people make their own decisions for development, for it is free enterprise with effective competition which is the crucial factor in achieving general economic progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A government has the right and the obligation to intervene to ensure effective national development, to conserve the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, to stimulate competition and to achieve equity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report gives the chronological sequence of events as follows:  1 3th January 1978: The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  formally directed that the Iwasaki Sangyo Co. prepare and submit to him an EIS in accordance with the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>20th July 1978: Final date for receipt of comments to the Office of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection in the Department of EH &amp; CD who then forwarded them on to the Consultants, UDPA (Planners) for consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>26th July 1978: Acting Minister for EH &amp; CD  (Mr Viner)  announces he has given an ‘environmental clearance’ to the project based on ‘the public review of the company’s draft EIS and an assessment by the Office of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection within the Department of EH &amp; CD’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report indicates that it is pertinent to note that both the Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development and the Treasurer were prepared to give approval for the project based only on a concept plan and a totally inadequate draft environmental impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1 974-  or its procedures and to this end the Australian Conservation Foundation is considering taking legal action to ensure the Act is complied with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have only to look at the Gold Coast of Queensland, and at other parts of Australia, to find that development of this nature has destroyed the local <span class="highlight">environment</span>, it has destroyed the ecological balance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Iwasaki has made a complete farce of the Australian Environmental Protection Act and the Australian Foreign Investment Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australians look to the House of Representatives to protect them from the weaknesses of State Governments but in the case of the Iwasaki Proposals the House of Representatives, in refusing to abide by the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection Act and the Foreign Investment Act, has abandoned its moral principles in an exercise of expediency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer noted that the Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development had given an <span class="highlight">environment</span> clearance for the proposal, on the basis that continuing <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection measures relating to the proposal would be taken by the Queensland Government under its own legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither the Treasurer nor the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  allowed sufficient time for the public to properly look at the so-called environmental impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report to which I allude now is the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> which it presented in June this year on annual reports referred to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the opportunity to say that almost immediately the practice which the Senate has developed of sending these reports to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has shown some considerable reward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report which has come from the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> again highlights the need for the Government perhaps to review its policy on the Australian Institute of Marine Science to allow it to be staffed at the level that was recommended in the first place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst it may not have special relevance to the report of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, or indeed of the report of the Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, I would note the following words in the conclusion of the Commission’s report:   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report that we have before us, from the Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, resulted in a unofficial way, from  Senator Melzer’s  drawing to the attention of the Senate a program on, I believe, the Australian Broadcasting Commission’s  Four Corners  which alerted the population to problems that seemed to be associated with certain pesticides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Committee felt that as one of its responsibilities was to exert a continuing surveillance of matters associated with the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, we should take steps to inform ourselves on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable senators I present the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Housing Costs, entitled ‘The Cost of Housing’, together with the text of a statement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  relating to the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should always recognise that the problems they face mainly are personal ones which have kept them apart from family and friends, and that their way of life without a settled <span class="highlight">environment</span> adds to the problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a report that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development congratulated a bank for providing loans to people who have to wait until next financial year to receive their home savings grants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that this article points out that, by using microbes to leach waste, metals can be recovered and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protected at hardly any cost, and that the technique can be used on most metals including, very importantly, uranium, copper, zinc and nickel? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can he also tell us how efficient such a leaching process would be, particularly in terms of environmental protection? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that research at the University of New South Wales is not directed at breeding the bacteria since that occurs freely in the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is based on submissions I made during the adjournment debate a fortnight ago when I sought information on the acreage of the proposed Kakadu National Park as set out in the second report of  Mr Justice  Fox’s Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry as compared with the Alaskan parklands provided for in legislation of the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sought information from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development on the points which he raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe he would know, although he did not mention it in his speech, that the genetic quality of merino rams in Australia has been built up because of the unique <span class="highlight">environment</span> here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind  Senator Walsh  that the sheep that were subjected to those trials were kept in a controlled <span class="highlight">environment</span> where husbandry was of a very high order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the facts are that in any given <span class="highlight">environment</span> merino sheep will change genetically quite substantially, particularly if that <span class="highlight">environment</span> is a harsh one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a sheep is taken out of its <span class="highlight">environment</span> it will produce a different type of wool and if the Opposition is unaware of this I suggest that it does some homework. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have sat with this young man in an office in Darwin surrounded by telephones, typists and other people working, solicitors and everybody else racing around, but I have also been able to sit with this young man in his own tribal area amongst his own tribal elders and see how he can go from one <span class="highlight">environment</span> to another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we look at the Western Australian experience over about the last 20 years we find that up until the late 1 960s the authorities responsible for recommending- there was no compulsionthe varieties of wheat to be grown in the State were strongly opposed to the production of wheat varieties other than those which, under suitable conditions anyway, were satisfactory for bread making whereas, I would have thought, it was always quite apparent that Western Australia, which consistently produced wheat of the lowest protein level of all the States, had an <span class="highlight">environment</span>, at least in the southern region of the State, which was suitable for the production of biscuit wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator Walsh  said, the fund provides the money for research into very important matters associated with wheat production- to increase the yields, to increase the quality of wheat, to increase the number of varieties available for different areas to make sure that they are relevant to the type of <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which wheat is being grown, work on disease control and also work on weed control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The then Minister, in response to a request by  Mr J.

  <li>
    <p>It mentions sirotherm desalination, continuous magnetic ion-exchange and adsorption systems, water clarification and decolourisation, treatment of sewage and sewage effluent, oxidation processes and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and public health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That nomination, which was received from the South Australian Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and which was prepared by the State Government River Torrens Committee, set out the relevant areas to be preserved, namely, the riverbed and bank from source to mouth but excluding the section of the river in the City of Adelaide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development: Is it a fact that staff ceilings have placed in jeopardy a wide range of safety checks at the Australian Atomic Energy Commission research establishment at Lucas Heights? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I do not have detailed information from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that my colleagues have suffered recently in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have to advise that such a subsidy would be contrary to the intent of the Government which has to operate, in its own right, in a competitive market <span class="highlight">environment</span> with other registered health insurance funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope, too, that the Minister will explain what should be done by the ordinary citizens in the community who are finding that there is a new <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which they have to make their health insurance arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable senators I present the agreement and memoranda of lease associated with the lease of stage 1 of the proposed Kakadu National Park, together with the text of a statement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Minister for Administrative Services read the text of the statement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The views expressed by  Senator Georges  and apparently by some members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation to the effect that we are going to throw away the Great Barrier Reef, that there is an ulterior motive behind all these changes, minor as they are, and that eventually we will allow indiscriminate oil drilling on the Reef with no controls, are, of course, absolute nonsense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Georges  puts forward the proposal that the member should have qualifications in the field of environmental sciences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable senator looks at the courses in environmental sciences which have been recently established in this country, he will see that the scope for selection is very limited if we attempt to find an Australian with the necessary qualifications in environmental sciences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1973 the University of New South Wales had an applied science master’s degree course in environmental pollution control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would not take much judgment on the part of honourable senators to decide that a  chairman  for such a vital Authority needs to have perhaps more than qualifications in the environmental sciences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>He is also the present Director of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Can the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development advise the Senate of the estimated value of the advances in 1978-79 to State land commissions or councils? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally morale in such an <span class="highlight">environment</span> is not always high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that mill there was a working <span class="highlight">environment</span> that would be the envy of most industrialists because people were not regarded as cogs in a machine but as contributors to a joint working experience producing high quality products based on a pride in workmanship frequently handed down within the family circle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By definition the <span class="highlight">environment</span> would not be a technologically sophisticated one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a statement made on 21 August 1978 the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development said that Pancontinental had given an assurance that no work had begun on the Arnhem Highway extension and that no activity beyond the permitted survey had been undertaken on the highway’s proposed 25 kilometre extension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-38-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That statement also said that the Government has not made a decision to allow Pancontinental to mine and that the Government will not be making a decision until the required processes of the law regarding the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and Aboriginal land claims have been completed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-38-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My own view is that those abortions should take place in a medical <span class="highlight">environment</span>, in a hospital atmosphere, subject to the judgment of the medical profession and the care of the medical profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to inform honourable senators of action the Government has taken in response to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> report on annual reports referred to the Committee dated 1 March 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the Cities Commission Report fell due at a time when the department concerned- now the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development- was undergoing extensive reorganisation; and the preparation of the report was overshadowed by tasks of greater priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, the annual bankcard rate which is around 18 per cent, is hardly an inducement for a person in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> of high unemployment to go out and spend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development relates to the announcement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development on Tuesday, 14 November, that the Commonwealth will reduce its grants to voluntary conservation groups from a $2 for $1 basis to a $1 for $1 basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is why, initially, we focussed on Aborigines living in or near an urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>, on the empirical evidence that they had elected to live and work in close contact with the European dominated market economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I present a supplementary report from the Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> arising from follow-up action on the report of May 1977 relating to the inquiry into the impact on the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the woodchip industry program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 28 November 1974 the Senate resolved that the matter of the impact on the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the current woodchip program be referred to the then Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Committee embarked upon an investigation of this reference during the autumn session of Parliament in 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 1 1 November 1975 the inquiry was halted by the dissolution of Parliament and subsequent federal election, but was resumed in March 1976 by the newly formed Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inquiry continued through 1976, culminating in the tabling of the Committee’s report entitled Woodchips and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>’ on 24 May 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this connection the Committee recognises that the development and implementation of techniques for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is a continuing process on which many influences are brought to bear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chapter 1 1 of the report entitled ‘Woodchips and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>’, tabled in May 1977, deals with the topic of land use planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is accordingly recommending that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  submit proposals to Cabinet for a mechanism to allow integrated consideration of national land use issues, and that the Prime Minister set up a framework for the establishment of a national land use policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee accordingly is now further recommending that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development draw up and promulgate, in collaboration with the States, a national policy for the development of an adequate system of national parks and conservation reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government exert as soon as possible its legal responsibilities to the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> by instituting a public inquiry into the proposition that a 150-metre wide strip of the foreshore of the Iwasaki land be returned to the control of the Crown, so averting the anomalous and virtually unprecedented present situation in which 19 kilometres of the Australian coastline are owned or controlled to high tide mark by a foreign developer? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This amendment is further proof of the inappropriateness of the Act and will mean that no stricter safety measures and no new environmental safeguards will be able to be brought in once the Bill is passed into law, despite the fact that everybody, including this Government, admits and accepts that there is no threshold information available at this point on which changes to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> can be judged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is just setting up machinery to cover the <span class="highlight">environment</span> as it now is; but when mining gets under way, if it does, and the information starts to flow in, if it starts to flow in, the Government will not be able to alter the circumstances under which uranium can be mined because the Government will be tied by the provisions of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Later it says that the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Energy and Natural Resources Sub-Committee of the United States Congress published its findings on the cost of nuclear power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-97-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On 25 October 1978,  Senator Primmer  asked the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development the following question without notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-97-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable senators I present the text of a statement by the Minister for Health relating to the June 1978 report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>: Herbicides, Pesticides and Human Health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reports of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development are of great concern to this Parliament because of decisions that have been made in those two areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the difficulty of selecting representative tasks and because benchmark results may not be representative of later performance in a real job <span class="highlight">environment</span>, benchmarks should normally only be used to verify suppliers’ performance claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking in what might be called injury time, on behalf of  Senator Robertson  and myself I ask the Leader of the Government  (Senator Carrick)  to endeavour to get from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  an early reply on submissions that we made on 16 November, as recorded on page 2146 of Senate  Hansard  concerning the general discussions on the estimates of the Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development because the assertions contained in the  Australian Financial Review  are in contradiction to what was said at the appropriate Estimates Committee hearings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-104-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I request the Minister for Administrative Services  (Senator Chaney),  as Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, to expedite a reply because the matter is of interest to what I might call the municipal militants in the central western suburbs of Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-104-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I associate the Opposition with the remarks of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Senator Webster,  in speaking to this condolence motion upon the death of former  Senator Lawrie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Senator Webster,  as the Leader of the National Country Party in this place, very appropriately led the tribute to Ellis Lawrie and, indeed, has said what has to be said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Minister to the Prime Minister’s undertaking, given in 1976, that the Government would observe the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act ‘in letter and in spirit’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I further refer the Minister to the Liberal and National Country Party policy in the 1975 and 1977 elections which states that ‘the cost of safeguarding the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from damaging intrusions by man is a cost, properly incurred in producing goods and services, which must ultimately be met by the producers of those goods and services and reflected in the price’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister how, having regard to those statements, he reconciles his own recent announcement as the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> that he was sympathetic to the view that Government decisions on environmental questions are often inappropriate intervention and that business has lost out in the bargain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge the question from  Senator Button  relating to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act which has been a matter of discussion over a number of years in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly a policy on environmental matters that could be followed by many political groups in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Is the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> aware that Ranger Uranium Ltd is to be served with a conservation order because of unnecessary damage at Jabiru? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister assure the Senate that the Government, as a partner in the venture, will ensure that in future strict environmental protection measures will be adopted at Jabiru? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> the following question, upon notice, on 6 March 1979: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>)- For the information of honourable senators I present the resolutions of the 105th meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council held in Sydney during August 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In such an <span class="highlight">environment</span> I am sure you will agree that the tight funding position for government departments and instrumentalities generally makes it essential that maximum benefit be achieved from every project funded and this must, of course, have inevitable implications for your own Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of these people never quite adapt to living in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> which to them would perhaps appear to be hostile, an <span class="highlight">environment</span> where people do not cross all their t’s and dot all their i’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, upon notice, on 1 9 September 1978: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-62-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister reiterated to the  Chairman  that the Government has not made a decision to allow Pancontinental to mine and the Government will not be making a decision until the required processes of the law regarding the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and Aboriginal land claims have been completed ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-62-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the following matter be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will be aware that on this occasion the  chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> accompanied me, thus opening the way for future flights to take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My recollection is that the allocation for this year was an amount of $95,000 which the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> would make available to the Department of Defence for its part in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask a question of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> which follows the question asked of him a short while ago by  Senator McAuliffe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> whether his attention has been drawn to a report in the  Sydney Morning Herald  of Saturday, 17 February, which referred to a study on vehicle emission controls prepared last year for the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That matter does not come within the ambit of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, it is the Government’s aim to ensure that pollution of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> due to uranium mining is reduced to a practical minimum, and we are confident that this can be achieved through the arrangements which both the Commonwealth and the Territory Governments have made for the control of mining in the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognised that 87 per cent of the Australian population lived in the urban <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> or alternatively the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of the decision given by  Mr Justice  Aickin in the High Court on 16 February 1 979 to the effect that private citizens and organisations claiming a non-property interest cannot enforce compliance by the Government with the administrative procedures of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the particular case refer to an attempt by the Australian Conservation Foundation to require the completion of a final environmental impact statement before approval is given for the development of an international tourist resort near Yeppoon in Queensland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government intend to introduce an amendment to the Act which will give citizens and groups the right to seek the implementation of existing environmental legislation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Court found that no locus standi existed for the ACF as a private group to force Commonwealth Ministers to comply with the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act and the administrative procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Science and <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  has just stated these two Bills are very much interrelated and therefore the Opposition does not object to the two of them being debated at the one time, especially as we of the Labor movement do not offer opposition to either of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  has indicated in his second reading speech that the objective of establishing this philatelic administration is to provide revenue for the people of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at the span of interests, as  Senator Chaney  is in the chamber I will refer particularly to Estimates Committee E. Last year it dealt with the Departments of Administrative Services, Industry and Commerce, Transport, Productivity, and <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the sort of <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which decisions could be made in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps I am more fortunate than others in the committee on which I serve, the Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, but in the admittedly short term that I have served on that committee I have not noticed a single tendency on the part of the  chairman  or members of that committee towards party politicking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, addressed to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, relates to a conference on endangered species to be held in Costa Rica at which, I understand, a senior officer will be present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> whether he saw the article in last Thursday’s  Australian  about the 85-tonne American space craft  Skylab  which is due to re-enter the earth’s atmosphere prematurely later this year or early next year and is planned to impact in a corridor 1,600 kilometres by 160 kilometres, which area includes part of eastern Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> a question which complements a question asked earlier today by  Senator Maunsell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taken together these events represent a deterioration in the international strategic and political <span class="highlight">environment</span> which has serious implications for our interests, as well as for those of our regional and Western partners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They cannot be divorced from the general strategic and political <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to the extent that that <span class="highlight">environment</span> deteriorates, their credibility as instruments of crisis management is diminished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Minister was absolutely right when he said that the matter of economic influence and interest, the matter of power politics, certainly has played a part in reaching the point where we have a deterioration in the international <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They cannot be divorced from the general strategic and political <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to the extent that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> deteriorates, their credibility as instruments of crisis management is diminished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is most appropriate that  Senator Webster,  the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, is here tonight as he has a particular interest in this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My concern, and the concern of a large number of people in the Northern Territory, is that no environmental impact study has been made of the proposal to build the casino. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This clearly is outlined in the document which the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has in his hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The foreshore studies indicate the casino will not unduly affect the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, as the development is further back than the existing caravan park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before self-government on 1 July 1978, the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1 974 applied to all projects in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, without any provision to the contrary, it can only be concluded that the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection ( Impact of Proposals) Act continues to apply to ail projects in the Territory after self-government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am placed in the situation yet of awaiting firm advice as to whether there is a part for the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act to have any application in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> seen recent Bureau of Statistics figures which indicate that spending by Australian companies on research and development fell by 18 per cent between 1973-74 and 1976-77, that is, from $190m to $157m, and that the number of man-years involved fell by a figure of 40 per cent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We face an <span class="highlight">environment</span> where at least 700,000 new jobs need to be found over the next seven years even if we were concerned simply to contain unemployment at existing high levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the following matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>: Oil Exploration in the Great Barrier Reef area, including all the possible effects of any such exploration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the few remaining features of the Westminster system as we have it in Canberra is that even though partisan politics are practised on the floor of the Senate and in the House of Representatives, when matters are referred to a committee such as the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, the members of the committees quite often- in fact, more often than not- lose their political identity and are able to reach a consensus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite plainly honourable members will understand that if we are talking about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Reef but not the Reef itself we have to ask the question: Where does it begin; where does it end? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That statement certainly conflicted with the proposal by the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development,  Mr Groom,  to declare the first part of the marine park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That editorial, more than anything else, eloquently sums up the position of the Australian Democrats and the reason that we ask the Senate to pass tonight this motion which seeks to refer this matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to make one or two comments on the motion before the Senate which seeks to refer this matter of oil exploration on the Great Barrier Reef to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, of which I am  Chairman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take some pride in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> following its inquiry into the effect on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the woodchip industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chapter 13 of that report covers conservation and the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation reported on the prevention and control of oil pollution in the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of increasing development of natural resources in the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> of particular interest to Australia, such as proposals to explore for oil on the Great Barrier Reef, and also because of the growing risk of pollution of Australian coastal waters, the following matter be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>: Australian marine science, including the development of a marine science program for Australia, in the tropical, temperate and sub-Antarctica waters and the coordination of research efforts between the various agencies involved in these areas of marine science, fisheries development and oceanography’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our position is based not only on our demonstrated concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> but also on the numerous reports of inquiries which have been presented to this Parliament on this matter, particularly the report of the Senate Select Committee on Off-Shore Petroleum Resources and, of course, the report of the royal commission which inquired into this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I would like to establish as a preliminary point is that there is no doubt that the party with the only real record of protecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> at the Federal level is the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the Labor Party which drew up all the significant environmental legislation which now exists at the federal level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It passed the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act which resulted in the saving of Fraser Island and it initiated the Fox inquiry into uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It made grants to various organisations involved with the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against that record there is so little of note at the federal level that it is clear that the party which is interested in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that honourable senators on the other side of the chamber often have talked about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> but their track record of achievements is limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the Government has a dubious interest in protecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ever since it came to office this Government has been trying to water down the environmental safeguards established by the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason, it allowed to remain in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> portfolio a Minister who had no interest whatsoever in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and who was prepared to buckle under pressure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real test on uranium is yet to come but there is waning confidence in the community that the Government will insist on adherence to proper environmental standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those activities, of course, were carried out under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a consequence of that decision, the Prime Minister gave  Mr Newman,  who was then the Minister who had the national responsibility for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, instructions to transfer the powers under that Act to the State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Agreements were entered into with most State governments which effectively mean that environmental issues will be taken seriously only in those states where there are in fact Labor governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transferring environmental control to  Sir Charles  Court is tantamount to saying that environmental issues in Western Australia are of no signficance at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the National Country Party now effectively has control of the environmental issues through the  Deputy  Prime Minister and  Senator Webster,  no environmentalist could be very optimistic about the results of that review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some time the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  has played no real role under the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is even a further worry for those who are concerned about the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this specific issue one only has to go back on the answer he gave to the Opposition spokesman on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> last Tuesday to which  Senator Chipp  referred in his speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The operative words of the Prime Minister were: ‘Where does the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the reef begin and where does it end?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last election campaign of 1977 1 made a public statement disclosing the existence of a Cabinet submission signed jointly by the  Deputy  Prime Minister and the then <span class="highlight">environment</span> Minister,  Mr Newman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The anti-<span class="highlight">environment</span> lobby is very strong in these circles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Newman to look after the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The current Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has said very little to date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe we will see him project himself as a strong environmentalist but there is nothing at this stage to suggest that he will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are debating a motion to refer to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> an inquiry into oil exploration in the Great Barrier Reef area, including all the possible effects of any such exploration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Chipp  asked whether there was some shift in the Government’s position concerning the operation of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act of 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask  Senator Missen:  Is there a secret sub-committee of the Cabinet existing at present which is reviewing the operation of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act of 1974? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my belief and if my information is correct, there is a subcommittee looking at this very Act and there is a sub-committee which possibly will recommend an amendment to the Act which will remove much of the protection that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> needs and which it has received under this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is to be some move to exploit or to explore the oil possibilities of the Great Barrier Reef, perhaps this <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act will be amended retrospectively or in some way compromised to facilitiate that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support  Senator Jessop  ‘s suggestion foreshadowing an amendment which would refer the matter to the Science and <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Committee in due course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know why it is but Australians take very little interest in their marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I return to my starting point which is basically a plea for an increase in the scientific knowledge of the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> off the coast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that as Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> he was a little emotional and did not mean what he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator also complained that there had not been enough investigation of the Geat Barrier Reef and in fact of the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the following matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>: Oil exploration in the Great Barrier Reef area, including all the possible effects of any such exploration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, expressed supportive views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, however, a need for greater research of the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>, both within and outside that defined area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This fact was recorded by an all-Party House of Representatives committee in a report tabled in Parliament last year on the subject of oil and the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned at the somewhat vague statements which the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  made earlier this month when discussing the possibility of drilling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has foreshadowed will be put at a meeting of the Committee tomorrow and that is that the Committee should continue to have a watching brief not only of the Barrier Reef situation but also of the Kakadu National Park situation as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These plans take account of differences in the local <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are, of course, speaking to a motion by  Senator Chipp  to send a reference to the Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> for investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There was a fellow named James Ford Cairns who, on 2 July 1975, was dismissed as  Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> over particular allegations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The departments which will be co-ordinating the arrangements include my own Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and the Department of Defence which also incorporates the Natural Disasters Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth remains the steward of the taxpayers’ funds and, in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> which is seeking more effective use of those funds, should be conscious of the obligations which arise from that stewardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be interested to know from the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  in his reply exactly what is happening in respect of program effectiveness reviews. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I would be reinforced in that assumption if the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> were to give some assurances to that effect in the course of this debate and I would believe even more in the Government’s good faith if it were to accept the amendment to proposed new section 48F which I propose to move in the Committee stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However I do suspect that it may be argued by the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster),  in reply, that this amendment, while not unexceptionable in principle, and while consistent with the Government’s intention and the Auditor-General’s intention and everybody else’s intention, is nonetheless unnecessary as a matter of strict statutory language because- no doubt this will be suggested- in this instance ‘may’ is to be read as meaning ‘shall’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-With respect, we have been subjected to some of the most mercilessly unmitigated waffle that we have been privileged to hear from the Minister for Science and <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Senator Webster,  outside of the context of Question Time where, regrettably, that kind of behaviour is par for the course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> who is also the Minister representing the Minister for the Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why has the linchpin for the protection of both the Aboriginal people and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> at the Ranger uranium mine site- that is, the declaration of the Kakadu National Park- not been used? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that the analysis and recommendations contained in the report will be an important contribution to its consideration of long-term policies to assist industry to adjust to a changing <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to promote sound industrial growth in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter what goodwill the present Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  or the Minister for National Development  (Mr Newman)  may have- and I believe they have the goodwill to get an energy policy- I can tell them they will never get it and they ought to know they will never get it unless the people give us this power at a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet, the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and the Minister for National Development say: ‘We believe in solar energy’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia seeks an <span class="highlight">environment</span> which would enable countries of the region both individually and collectively to pursue policies designed to enhance political stability, economic advancement and cohesion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> aware that no environmental controls are being enforced at the Ranger uranium site in the Northern Territory and that both pollution and erosion are virtually uncontrolled? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister inform the Parliament who, in fact, will be responsible for environmental protection during the development of mining sites and the exploitation of uranium deposits in the Northern Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator asks who will be responsible for environmental protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the honourable senator will know that generally when an environmental impact statement is prepared under the <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection legislation, certain provisions indicate whether there are faults or flaws in the environmental impact statement which has been produced and whether further work will be necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The environmental matters will be supervised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The enforcement of <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection can take several forms which, I think, as yet have not been decided upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Despite the temptation which always comes upon me when I hear the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  make a speech such as that, let me ignore all the predictable, gratuitous and, as usual, quite ineffectual jibes, insults and heavy handed ironies of which his speech was so full. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In making this decision, the Government has taken full account of the recommendations made by the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  in relation to the final environmental impact statement submitted by Queensland Mines on 19 January 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that the Government, when announcing on 25 August 1977 its decision to proceed with uranium mining at Ranger, indicated that further uranium mining projects in the Alligator Rivers region would only proceed when the Government was fully satisfied as to the acceptability of the impact of the development on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the Aboriginal people, having regard for the region as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislative controls to which I have referred provide for the establishment of the Office of the Supervising Scientist, a co-ordinating committee for the Alligator Rivers Region and a research institute to maintain a close watch over the <span class="highlight">environment</span> within the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition the Northern Land Council has been given standing in the Northern Territory Supreme Court to suit in relation to the enforcement of the environmental requirements controlling mining at Ranger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Environment</span> advised the Minister for Trade and Resources recently that there are no objections on environmental grounds to that project subject to satisfactory arrangements being made with the Western Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his statement to parliament on 25 August 1977 the Minister for Trade and Resources said that the Commonwealth Government would take decisions on the development of projects such as Yeelirrie subject to satisfactory completion of the necessary environmental requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to see a balance between the economic development of our uranium resources and the effective protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the Government has consistently placed mining interests and profits before the interests of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and, as we see it, before the interests of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Government was fully satisfied as to the acceptability of the impact of the development on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the Aboriginal people, having regard for the region as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it has to be accepted that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is rather a passive aspect and therefore it cannot in its own right articulate its views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here I raise questions of safety and appropriateness as well as the question of land rights and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two major devices recommended by  Mr Justice  Fox to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the Aborigines in the Alligator Rivers region have been disregarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All those high and mighty words about carefully planned development, about looking after the interests of the Aboriginal communities, about being concerned about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are being shown for what they are- a front for an open slather by the mining companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is ludicrous to suggest that a management plan can be in operation and <span class="highlight">environment</span> controls established before full scale development begins at Ranger and Nabarlek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By that time a Labor government will be installed in Canberra and, as already indicated through my Party’s federal conference, that government will repudiate any new uranium sales contracts in the light of the lack of safeguards, in the light of inadequate consultations with the affected communities and in the light of the failure to implement promises to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and to establish national parks, matters which were expressed clearly in policy considerations for the 1975 and 1977 election campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This statement, like so many of the Government’s statements which are placed before the Senate, ignores the basic problems that beset the uranium industry, ignores the basic problems that face Aborigines in the area, ignores the commitments that we have made to protect that <span class="highlight">environment</span> and ignores the commitments that we have made to establish the essential national parks in that region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Is the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> aware of a claim by the Senior Lecturer in Administration at the University of Tasmania that the Federal Cabinet has under review the following Acts: the Environmental Protection Act, the Australian Heritage Commission Act, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service Act, and the Great Barrier Marine Authority Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act has been under review for a number of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, there is a review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is continuing to examine matters of real environmental significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The letter to which the honourable senator refers is incorrect in suggesting that there is any downgrading at all of <span class="highlight">environment</span> protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is devoted to upholding the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> for the good of the Australian public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> recall making reference on 1 1 May last year to a White Paper on Antarctic policy and programs which at that time he believed would be before Cabinet within some weeks? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw his attention to a question which I asked in this place on 7 March 1979 and which dealt with environmental problems at the Northern Territory Ranger uranium site. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister will no doubt remember that he was referring to the environmental impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that on 20 September 1978 his predecessor, the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development,  Mr Groom,  when referring to environmental impact statements, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take it that the honourable senator is anxious to know what are the environmental procedures set down in relation to the development of the Ranger site and that the honourable senator feels that there is some inconsistency between what may have been said previously by the Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development and by me as Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My own view is that there is no reason for the environmental consequences of Ranger not being made known and I was of the view that that point had been put forward by the Minister under whose control the matter rests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that I would compare the two answers that had been given by the two Ministers in their capacity as Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and see whether there was anything inconsistent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see no reason for the environmental assessments not being made public and I will look into that matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 22 February, I asked the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  a question relating to this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recommended that the Federal Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development as he then was and the State Ministers responsible for youth, sport and recreation appeal to all sportsmen and women throughout Australia not to lend their names and prestige to the promotion of alcohol or tobacco. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, upon notice, on 21 February 1979: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-13">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is also now wide acceptance that authorities involved in urban planning and development have a responsibility to preserve important elements of the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> not only for their own sake but also as an essential element in the future urban <span class="highlight">environment</span> for a variety of recreational and educational purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>: As New Zealand has recently announced a large discovery of underwater phosphate reserves in its off-shore territorial waters, is the Minister aware that any similar reserves exist in Australian territorial waters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Commonwealth Government is concerned about the possible environmental risks associated with the importation of aquarium fish, particularly fresh Water species. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 1 December 1976 the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development,  Mr Newman,  accepted the responsibility for advising the Commonwealth Government on matters relating to aquarium fish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, any escape of these fish into the fresh water <span class="highlight">environment</span> would be a very major problem because these fish would harm our fresh water species in many areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 7 June 1978 the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> tendered a report on the subject of annual reports being referred to the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On behalf of the Government, the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  said that he was unable to give the Senate any accurate information on the matter; that he would attempt to get an answer on whether the report had been pigeon-holed; that he did not know the quality of the report; and that he was unable to make any further comment at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So far as I can tell, there  is no provision for levying hens kept by egg producers in the Northern Territory, but that is a matter I will be taking up in the Committee stage or on which I ask the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  to advise us in his reply to the second reading debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What action does the Minister propose to take to ensure that major changes in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> are not made without first considering the effect they will have on local species of plants and animals, so that our nation’s natural beauty may be preserved? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As I rise to answer this question may I just comment, if you will permit me to do so,  Mr President,  that there are honourable senators who are particularly interested in science and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Georges,  who rises regularly to complain about the length of answers has not asked one question on an environmental matter in three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister will realise if he goes back over the past three years that I have asked many questions on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have also asked questions on environmental matters concerning the Iwasaki project at Yeppoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that it would be dear to the heart of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster),  who is at the table, if the appointees were to include a prominent rural producer from Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The program will assist in ensuring the supply of raw material to future forest product industries and we believe contribute to the longterm industrial development of that State, as well as enhance the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teach them to protect their <span class="highlight">environment</span> and let them know how the unions want it left unspoiled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>: When is the Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory to be gazetted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> read the report from the United States authorities on the use of 2,4,5-T in Oregon? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, follows the question asked earlier by  Senator Melzer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister has not done so already, will he read the findings of the United States Environmental Protection Agency that led to the bans on 2,4,5-T in March 1979? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This matter relates to the interests of the Department of Health and the Minister for Health as well as to my own interests in science and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it comes within the realm of questions which ought to be answered by my colleague, the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My question, which is directed to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, follows from a question that I asked earlier this week about the importation of aquarium fish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Acting Supervising Scientist appointed under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act 1978, is  Mr R.  M. Fry a distinguished Scientist, who is one of Australia’s most experienced health physicists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be appreciated that the functions of the Supervising Scientist, as set out in the Act, require that a sizeable organisation be established, to undertake research, supervision, and regulatory tasks, including monitoring of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Alligator Rivers Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The action of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  in incorporating this statement vindicates my point that such information should be given subsequent to Question Time rather than during Question Time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- I seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard  a summary of the Government’s response to the Reports on Annual Reports presented by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs and the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs presented its ‘Report on Annual Reports Referred to the Committee’ on  6  June 1978, while the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> ‘Report on Annual Reports’ was presented on 7 June 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister,  Mr Viner,  commented on both these matters in his response to the March report of the Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> (House of Representatives  Hansard  14 November 1978, pages 2729-30) and the Government does not believe that they require further response now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One other issue, which was mentioned by the Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, was the need for a Government response to problems raised in annual reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has pointed out that very shortly the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  will be making a statement in regard to the CSIRO ‘s role in water resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  reflected the feelings of all of us when he said in his second reading speech that it was the expectation that the new parliament house would be what he called the crowning achievement ‘within the parliamentary triangle where already we have our great National Library and where the new National Gallery and High Court are now under construction’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Volume IB contains ASTEC’s views and recommendations on agriculture and forestry, mineral resources, manufacturing industry, services and <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will work closely with relevant Ministers, particularly the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to our giving priority to capabilities needed for operations in our own <span class="highlight">environment</span>, our defence force should also provide the Government of the day with the practical option of contributing to Pacific defence in accordance with the ANZUS Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The size and shape and equipment of our Defence Force should be assessed in Australia’s own geopolitical <span class="highlight">environment</span>- and this for three reasons: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s isolation from other continents, and our physical <span class="highlight">environment</span> of sea and air space and archipelagic territories, carry a number of pointers for our defence capabilities; as do the physical characteristics of our own continent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in respect of armed threats within our own geographic <span class="highlight">environment</span> that our allies could be expected to look to Australia to be reasonably self-reliant, and to make a maximum effort to look after its own security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is success in sustaining the recognition of a common interest Australia has the prospect of an <span class="highlight">environment</span> which adds protection to the defence of Australia, rather than creates a defence hazard for us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1962 the Liberal-Country Party Government’s representative at the Stockholm conference on the human <span class="highlight">environment</span> voted in favour of a 10-year moratorium on the taking of whales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The way in which the people working on that project went about establishing their case, explaining their case, appeared before the independent inquiry, presented their case and persuaded the inquiry of the validity of their case is an exercise in real participatory democracy on the one hand, in that people who are interested and informed can bring recommendations to the Government; and a real outpouring of concern for natural resources, the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation on the other hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By respecting their right to live and to co-exist peacefully with us there is evidence that we can find harmony with our <span class="highlight">environment</span>, with our fellow creatures and perhaps with ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of that question I asked the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster),  who is now in the chamber and who is the Minister representing the Minister for the Capital Territory, the following specific question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct my question to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The current session of the law of the sea conference in Geneva is dealing with the protection of marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Why is not the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> represented at this meeting? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does not this situation expose grave negligence on the part of the Minister as he is responsible for comprehensive legislation to protect Australia’s marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>, nationally and internationally? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time these matters do not concern my Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assure the honourable senator that when those matters are concluded he will find the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> well forward in seeking to protect Australia’s interests in those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which concerns the Harrisburg nuclear plant and the general public concern about it expressed in most countries, is directed to two Ministers- the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, who of course would be concerned about this matter, and the Minister representing the Minister for National Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, to what extent will environmental matters which might concern the Ministers at present be reviewed, and when will information be given to the Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noticed that the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  mentioned that the agreements had been signed in February. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>campaigns against involvement in the Vietnam war or conscription for the purposes of that war, the importance of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and ecology and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster),  who is in charge of the House at the moment, is probably one of the victims of people on this side of the House who have tried to persuade him that there should be more research into solar energy and plants for the development of vegetable alcohol, if one may describe it in that way, in the same way that the plant at Sarina does use sugar cane for the development of alcohol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, on notice, on 21 March 1979: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The working <span class="highlight">environment</span> division of the Department of Productivity was engaged last year to design a model public contact area for departmental officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government responded to recommendations made in a report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> following an investigation into the herbicides 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Can the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> tell the Senate how many SIROTEM machines, developed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation for mineral research, and manufactured by an Adelaide firm, have been sold in Australia and how many have been exported? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, relates to project ‘Storm Fury ‘ and a recent statement by the head of his Department that many advantages had been gained from the visit of the United States aircraft which took part in some experiments during a cyclonic situation in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to the honourable senator’s second and third questions, I state that the supervising scientist is required to advise me in the first instance on the effects of uranium mining operations on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Alligator Rivers region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will provide the opportunity for debate in the Parliament on the measures adopted for environmental control in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response to the honourable senator’s fourth question, I draw his attention to the comprehensive statement incorporated in  Hansard  on 29 March on the role of the Supervising Scientist and the measures being adopted by the Northern Territory Government and this Government to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Alligator Rivers Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The proposed planning system will require examination of the environmental impact of urban development at a much earlier stage and with a wider perspective than generally occurs at present under the impact of proposals legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee has said that there should be memorandums of understanding between the Minister for the Capital Territory and the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> to ensure that the system of Structure and Development Plans and the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act work in a comprehensive and complementary manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The administration of this protective legislation is to become the responsibility of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when we sought information from the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  about our sovereign rights in the Australian Antarctic Territory, some ambiguity arose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> told me that it was a case of taking the middle ground and trying to blunt the thrust of the Soviet Union and Japan which wished to maximise their operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are speaking about activities which in the normal sense would be described as political activities whether they are associated with the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, an industrial struggle or issues associated with a contest of opinion between one group of people and the government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will quote from  Hansard  so that there can be no mistake that in actual fact the words that I refer to were used by the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  in reply to a speech by  Senator Keeffe  about the problems that were being recognised in the nuclear industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Senator Webster,  with that portfolio, would have been much more aware of what is happening in the nuclear industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How can the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> sit in this chamber and say that there has been no loss of life? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is not terribly well informed on nuclear matters let me just tell him that since the USS  Thresher  incident, and up to October 1976- because that is the last date that I have- there were a total of 32 accidents involving nuclear submarines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> said last night that the nuclear industry is a responsible industry, and I have to agree with him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>- I have expressed this opinion in this place before- I believe that the burning of fossil fuels in our society is perhaps one of the greatest risks we face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The plan of management prepared by the Director and approved by Parliament is intended to ensure environmental protection, and that appropriate management practices are employed, taking into account the interests of the traditional Aboriginal owners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Aboriginals, with their long involvement with and concern for the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> are seen as having a key role to play in Park management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia established a 200-mile off-shore fishing zone and indicated that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> should not be interfered with in that zone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The State Government took the Aboriginal people out of the familiar <span class="highlight">environment</span> of a settlement and put them in the foreign <span class="highlight">environment</span> of municipal councils under which they had self-management but were denied any of the protection which the Queensland legislation gave to Aboriginals on settlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I direct a question to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and refer to the concept mentioned by  Mr Justice  Fox of Kakadu National Park reaching stage 2, which would have included river catchment regions and would have embraced the Gimbat and Goodparla pastoral leases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition to transport portfolio considerations, the statement reflects the responsibilities of, and advice from, my colleagues the Minister for Science and <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster),  the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt),  and the Minister for National Development  (Mr Newman). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the outset, however, 1 must emphasise that the Commonwealth Government is committed to protect the health and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, all governmentsState, Territory and Commonwealth- must also, in the national interest, have regard to the effects of proposed measures, not only on health and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> but also on impacts on the consumer, industry, resources and the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In developing a framework for future action, it is clear that a number of steps must be taken to improve the implementation, administration and durability of emission control systems in the context of realistic health, <span class="highlight">environment</span>, transport and energy objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This has been highlighted by many bodies including the Senate Select Committee on Air Pollution, the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council, the National Health and Medical Research Council, as well as ATAC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ATAC and Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council should be in a position at their early 1981 meetings to consider requirements for 1985 standards and the development of a new vehicle emission rule to implement such standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although not directly relevant to the special ATAC meeting in April, lead issues will form an important and integral part of future motor vehicle emissions strategies in terms of protection of health and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and vehicle and energy costs and efficiency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to see the Government perhaps giving that a little more attention and seeing an electric vehicle not only as providing a solution to a problem of fuel conservation but also as providing a solution to a problem with our total <span class="highlight">environment</span> in our cities and perhaps as making a much greater contribution towards community health than the Government realises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a senator representing New South Wales I feel that my State and, in particular, the capital city of that State is most affected by the statement that has been put down in the Senate this evening by the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the New South Wales Minister for Transport, the New South Wales Minister for Planning and <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and the South Australian Minister of Transport for standing up to the arrogant attitude that is being adopted by the Commonwealth of saying as far as the great city of Sydney is concerned that the status quo should continue until 1985 and that if by then the situation appears to have deteriorated further additional controls might need to be implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>asked the Minister representing the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, upon notice, on 24 October 1978: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> aware that the Wide Bay-Burnett Conservation Council in Queensland has had its grant, made under the grants to voluntary conservation organisations scheme, slashed from $5,000 to $2,850? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that a change in policy was notified by the previous Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development in that there would be a dollar for dollar grant to conservation organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only are millions of dollars spent on hospital treatment which a healthier living <span class="highlight">environment</span> would make unnecessary, but more millions have to be spent on unemployment relief because Aborigines have not received the training and skills which would qualify them for employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last Thursday,  Senator Webster,  the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, provided information to the Senate which was wrong, which he knew to be wrong and for which there has been no satisfactory explanation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In October of that year, the Minister for National Resources,  Mr Anthony,  and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, who was then  Mr Newman,  put up a Cabinet submission recommending exploration in the Capricornia channel area of the reef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, lt follows previous questions concerning drilling on the Great Barrier Reef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senior Government Ministers including the Prime Minister, his  deputy, Mr Anthony, Senator Carrick,  the Leader of the Government in the Senate, and  Senator Webster,  the Minister responsible for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, are all publicly denying that drilling on the Reef will be permitted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also draw attention to a joint statement issued by  Senator Ken  Wriedt, Senate Opposition Leader, and  Mr Barry  Cohen, shadow Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>JOINT PRESS STATEMENT BY SENATOR KEN WRIEDT, SENATE OPPOSITION LEADER, AND MR BARRY COHEN, SHADOW MINISTER FOR THE <span class="highlight">ENVIRONMENT</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President,  you may acknowledge that as I came to the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> portfolio in December of last year there was a great deal of background relating to this matter which is probably best known by the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the applications for renewal were ultimately to be entertained, it would be necessary to assess them in terms of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In so doing, I am indebted to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  for rereading to honourable senators the  Hansard  of last Thursday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I am reminded that the Government is having informal discussions with those two groups of people to subvert the very process which the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> should be concerned to protect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate has before it a motion moved by  Senator Wriedt  that the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  no longer has the confidence of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it is a censure motion by the Opposition moved in the full seriousness of such a motion, as  Senator Wriedt  has said, against the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Senator Webster  is responsible for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act and its administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask a question of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> the following question, upon notice, on 2 1 February 1 979: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-47-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ‘List of Species and Genera of Aquarium Fishes Proposed for Continued Importation’ was drawn up to reduce to manageable proportions for import control purposes the number of species of exotic freshwater aquarium fishes approved for importation but to include species that had been commonly imported by the trade for many years and were regarded to be of low environmental and disease risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-47-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The guidelines followed by the Advisory Committee in compiling the list were to exclude species that fell into any one or more of the following categories: have caused problems when introduced anywhere in the world: might have detrimental effects on other species of fish; might have detrimental effects on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>: were known carriers of any economically important disease or parasite believed not to be in Australia; were harmful to man or livestock; had a wide capacity for survival and dispersal; might readily be confused with undesirable species: or grew to a large size suitable for food or game fish stocking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-47-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within the Commonwealth Government, responsibility for environmental policy advice and the co-ordination of Government policy on the matter rests with the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and the administration of import controls and quarantine rests with the Ministers Tor Business and Consumer Affairs and Health respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-47-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have also been referred to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> who is responsible for advising the Government on environmental policy aspects and for co-ordinating Government policy in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-47-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw to the attention of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> a report from Gulnare in South Australia that some low-lying land with a high salt content and subject to flooding has been converted into productive country following Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation experimentation and importation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> whether he recalls yesterday, during a debate involving himself, using these words: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Is the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> aware of the report published in the  Age  on Friday last released by the United States National Academy of Scientists which concluded that there was no known threshold below which radiation ceased to have adverse effects on human beings? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I receive a number of letters which put to me as the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> that the Council is attempting to bring pressure on the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that if it were it would have attempted to bring pressure on me as the Minister with responsibilities for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> whether he is aware that in an interview today with the ABC the newly appointed  Chairman  of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park,  Mr Higgs,  said in answer to a question about possible differences between the Commonwealth and Queensland governments: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, received any progress reports on the research and development of SYNROC being conducted by Professor Ringwood of the Australian National University? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The classic lesson we can learn from this paper is that worker participation- not the kind of worker participation that terrified the unions when such a suggestion was put under another guise in previous years, but genuine worker participation, as  Senator Button  quite aptly described it- can create an <span class="highlight">environment</span> for future discussion, for future consultation and for future consensus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I will say is that it does create an <span class="highlight">environment</span>, to use  Senator Button’s  words. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My perusal of Special Branch files show that many hundreds of people have done nothing more than take an active part in many causes where time and changing opinion have usually proved them to be right in the eyes of most Australians- campaigns against involvement in the Vietnam war or conscription for the purposes of that war, the importance of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and ecology and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did he see the television program  Nationwide  last evening in which the interviewer,  Mr Richard  Carleton, said that he had invited him to discuss the Great Barrier Reef issue with the Opposition spokesman on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>,  Mr Barry  Cohen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and concerns the statements reported today of the newly appointed  Chairman  of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority,  Mr Higgs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and relates to a question asked by  Senator Wriedt  of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Will the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> clearly define the role of the consultative committee in relation to the Great Barrier Reef Authority? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the explanation he gave earlier in Question Time of the reasons for  Senator Webster’s  inability to appear on a television program last night, I ask: Will he give us an assurance that, if a similar invitation is extended to  Senator Webster  today to debate the matter with  Mr Cohen,  the Opposition spokesman on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> or with any other member of the Opposition, he will permit  Senator Webster  time to appear on that program? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last Tuesday when I moved a motion of no confidence in the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster),  I indicated to the Senate that I was not bringing on that motion light-heartedly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Specifically, Ministers who are involved in this cover-up and who have played some part in it are the Prime Minister,  Mr Fraser,  the  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Mr Anthony,  the Minister for National Development,  Mr Newman,  the Leader of the Government in the Senate,  Senator Carrick,  the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Senator Webster,  the Minister for Housing and Construction,  Mr Groom,  and the Minister for Administrative Services,  Mr McLeay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already indicated to the Senate that the Opposition does not believe any of those statements in view of the correspondence which passed between the Minister for National Development and the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, here we have clear evidence of an arrangement between a government authority and an oil company which will be detrimental to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> but which has had the approval of the current Minister for the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and his predecessor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the current Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, is even proud to come into this Senate to give us this information completely unaware of what he is doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response to a question from  Senator Cavanagh,  the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Senator Webster,  indicated that there was no conflict between  Mr Higgs’  statement and his own views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well to remember  Senator Webster’s  position in the Government in that he is responsible for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Minister is not fearful of the prospect of mining or drilling on the Barrier Reef, there is little chance that any resistance will be raised in Cabinet to the views of those ministers, such as the Minister for National Development, who favour such activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Wriedt,  in order to bolster his case today, widens that attack which he started earlier in the week against the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I will refer that matter to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that the Prime Minister, the Minister for National Development, the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and I-  Senator Webster  and I have referred to the matter this week- have made the Government’s position quite clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the beginning of my speech I said that there was a dichotomy between protecting the interests of the people of Norfolk Island and giving them as much self-government as possible- perhaps more than the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  would desireand recognising at the same time that the standards which are applicable to the Norfolk Island people should be as far as practicable the same as the standards which are applicable to the Australian people in matters such as income tax and social welfare legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>asked the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> the following question, upon notice, on 27 March 1 979: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-3">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Statement set out in detail the various steps which have been taken for the protection of both the Aboriginal people and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the Alligator Rivers Region since the government announced its uranium decision on 25 August 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-3">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition moves this motion of want of confidence in the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  because of his wilful, deliberate and persistent misleading of the Senate over the actions of various Ministers in relation to the Great Barrier Reef issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has provided answers to questions that were incorrect and which he knew to be incorrect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me briefly reflect on the full extent of the Opposition’s charge against the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event, the key disclosure made by  Senator Webster  was that on some occasion, the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development,  Mr Groom,  wrote to the Minister for National Development,  Mr Newman,  and provided him with certain information concerning the boundaries of the Capricornia section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard  a copy of a letter dated 20 October 1978 from  Mr Groom,  the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, to  Mr Newman,  the Minister for National Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In your previous capacity as Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, you received a letter of 3 November 1 977 from the then Minister for National Resources in which concern was expressed over the proposed Proclamation of the area encompassing Lady Elliot Island and the Bunker and Capricorn Groups as part of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> no longer has the confidence of the Senate because he deliberately misled the Senate on a number of occasions in relation to issues pertaining to the Great Barrier Reef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware of minutes in which assessments of various letters are made and which indicate the attitude of which this Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> should be aware in discussions on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In dealing firstly with what  Senator Webster,  the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, is now pleased to call his case, I should make clear that it is not a defence to the Opposition’s charges for a Minister in this chamber to say: ‘I am ignorant’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final part of his speech was most important because he said: ‘I am not going to be held to a recollection of what took place before I became Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today he said: ‘I am not going to be held to a recollection of what took place before I became the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The refusal to answer questions, the fudging over issues and the selective reference to documents, show quite clearly that the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is quite aware that he misled the Parliament on 3 May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate has been treated today to a re-run of what is becoming a tired and cracked old record on the subject of some of the answers given in the Senate on certain days by the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  and his remarks in certain debates that have taken place here on those answers and in respect of the Government’s policy on the Great Barrier Reef and the reef region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Webster  received this letter very shortly after he became Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition thinks that it has a trump card in producing and incorporating in  Hansard  today the letter from  Senator Webster’s  predecessor as Minister responsible for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the present Minister for Housing and Construction,  Mr Groom,  which was addressed to the Minister for National Development and dated 20 October 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister say whether any specialised sections of the departments concerned- the Department of Health, the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs- are dealing with research or information related to the occupational hazards of working in the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of that herbicide? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No doubt, comment will be made about the additional that Zorn included for protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, which brings the 4Vi per cent to a higher level; but, compared with the 1 5 per cent royalty that is paid to Indians in the United States and the royalty that is paid by the Bougainville copper mine in Papua New Guinea, it is certainly a pitiful amount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I seek information on whether the bulk of the $300,000 for the rehabilitation of the Finnis River will be handed over to the Northern Territory Government now that the Northern Territory has assumed statehood or whether officers of the Department of Science and the Environmentwhom I regard as the custodians of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the federal sense- are working in collaboration with the Northern Territory Government to see that the river is fully rehabilitated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It expressed some fears that a certain impression might have reached the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  that because its membership may have declined there should be a cut in its annual grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the misinformation from  News Weekly  sources will not be used to hobble the Australian Conservation Foundation in the vital role it plays as a custodian of our <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would like to know when the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> or the Atomic Energy Commission first started to rehabilitate the area, when the job will be completed and how much the job will cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are examining five departments one of which is the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was an observation made in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> which was presented here in March this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I commenced I stated that I wanted to talk about division 543, which relates to the Antarctic Division of the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was saying that  Mr Webster  from the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> said at the Estimates Committee hearing that a great number of firms gave a great deal of elaboration in their proposals and that the Department had received 40 or 50 such proposals to the design request. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of his report to the Labor Government, we continued with the project subject to an environmental impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We spent $6m on this project and yet we still do not have that environmental impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where is the environmental impact statement that the previous report called for? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the information I have just given to the Senate, I am compelled to ask some questions of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  who is in the cham ber at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because it is a matter of importance I think that the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, who is in charge of the House at the moment, should have it referred to the Department of Foreign Affairs tomorrow morning, at first light if necessary, and make sure that a reply is before the Senate preferably tomorrow or at the latest by Monday of next week when the Senate resumes after the weekend break. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>: Is it a fact that the Capricornia section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park has not been declared because the areas of permits Q/4P and Q/5P infringe on the proposed section of the Marine Park? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Creation of a protected zone for the preservation of the unique <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Strait area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to emphasise that the provisions of the treaty to a very large extent incorporate recommendations made by the Committee in its earlier report on the Torres Strait boundary, namely: That the Torres Strait Islands should remain part of Australia; that freedom of passage for Australians and Papua New Guineans should be guaranteed in the protected zone; that mining and drilling in the seabed should be prohibited until agreement is reached between all interested parties; and that new commercial ventures should not be permitted in the area unless they are compatible with the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic concept of the Defence Force Academy was to replace the degree stream component of the Royal Military College, the Royal Australian Air Force Academy, the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, the Darling Downs Institute and the Royal Australian Navy College with a single academy which would provide a balanced and liberal university education in a military <span class="highlight">environment</span> for officer cadets of the three Australian Services, concurrently with a program of professional military training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee agreed that there is a need for a greater proportion of tertiary educated officers in the Defence Force and that cadets should be involved in a military <span class="highlight">environment</span> as much as possible during their tertiary studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the report admits the benefit of cadets being involved in the military <span class="highlight">environment</span>, as it is called, as much as possible during their tertiary studies, it also says that there were advantages in the additional use of tertiary institutions, in which there are increasingly additional places available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr President, I wish to report to the Senate on the implementation of recommendations of both the initial report on ‘Woodchips and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>’ presented by the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> in May 1977 and the Committee’s supplementary report on November 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Commonwealth portfolios were involvedPrimary Industry, Science, and the former Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Supplementary Report contained further recommendations to the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair),  the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, and to myself as Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assessments of environmental impact have been carried out under the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act where applications have been made to review licences and to increase export quantity, as in the case of the Harris Daishowa (Aust.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where appropriate, both the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council and the Australian Forestry Council have been involved in discussion of the reports ‘ recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In common with a number of other inquiries, the Committee has stressed the importance of land use planning in environmental management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, many land use interests, such as nature conservation, soils, forestry and <span class="highlight">environment</span>, are covered by existing ministerial councils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement which has just been incorporated by the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  states, in part: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> commenced operation there was a tremendous interest in the woodchip industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Webster,  in his portfolio as Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, should give maximum thrust to every echelon of the CSIRO to see that this industry maximises its contributions on research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do so in these terms: At Question Time this morning I asked the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Senator Webster,  some questions relating to the reasons for the failure to proclaim the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it has been raised on three occasions by way of a censure motion against the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  for giving conflicting answers, for giving answers which are nonanswers and for fudging the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had that bizarre Question Time a week ago when the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> just refused to answer any questions on this issue at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why, subsequent to that and after the document had been served on the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  this afternoon, when the Minister was making his statement to the Senate I asked whether he was making a ministerial statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what cannot be taken from us is the feeling- perhaps I could use the word ‘suspicion’- that  Mr Newman  was required, in fact forced, to alter his position on this matter in order to protect the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Senator Webster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is revealed by this whole matter is a conflict between  Mr Newman’s  Department and the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has been the attitude of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are people in this country who do not give a damn about conservation or protecting our natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be able to make a contribution to the assessment of the social, physical and environmental problems associated with the mining of uranium, but obviously the State Minister has no desire to seek or even to accept its assistance in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very significant that environmental bodies, whether they be wildlife organisations, littoral societies or ordinary environmental groups, are not going to be prevailed upon to assist in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mention was made on  AM  this morning that a report from the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> indicates that radioactivity levels at Nabarlek uranium mine in the Northern Territory are higher than was previously indicated, and that the health of workers there may be endangered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I heard this morning’s  AM  report on the subject and I understand that it referred to my Department’s assessment report on the final <span class="highlight">environment</span> impact statement prepared by Queensland Mines Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I direct a question to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he believe that adequate work is being undertaken altogether by the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> to inform people in Western Australia of future dangers and the best means of avoiding them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Senator Wheeldon is correct in that the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has some reference to the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, concerns statements reported today by the head of the wildlife division of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,  Mr Bill  Jordan, who is visiting Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> will remember that earlier this year I asked him a question on the proposed re-entry date and re-entry path for Skylab. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator should recognise from the last half a dozen questions that have been asked of me that it would be impossible for me to be adequately briefed on all subjects which come within the portfolio of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, let alone for the Minister who represents me in another place to be adequately briefed on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Director then submits the plan to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> together with any representations made and comments by the Director on those representations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The licence will be a ‘prescribed instrument’ within the meaning of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Act 1978, which enables the Northern Territory Supreme Court at the suit of the Director of National Parks and Wildlife, the Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission or the Northern Land Council to make orders for the enforcement of any requirement under a prescribed instrument so far as the requirement relates to any matter affecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the Alligator Rivers region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have lived all their lives in this <span class="highlight">environment</span> because the bureaucracy- the authorities- says that they are mentally retarded and require no more than to be kept warm, to be fed and to be sheltered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, because of the type of work in which my Department is involved, with its responsibilities for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, particularly in the Northern Territory, under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act a vessel of similar type- but perhaps not as expensive to run as is this one- would be very useful for conducting research on fresh water crocodiles and other aspects of river estuaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As yesterday was World <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Day, which was celebrated throughout the world, does the Minister agree that the absence of a clearly thought out energy policy designed to minimise waste and to encourage alternative energy uses disadvantages the entire community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those who were associated with that day in Australia thought out the title which was used, which I think was very appropriate, and indeed had good media coverage so that people could consider that which we wish to retain- our natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of recent statements in the media attributed to the petroleum industry that it would cost more than 5c a litre to reduce existing lead levels and a counter claim by Professor Lloyd Smythe, Professor of Analytical Chemistry at the University of New South Wales, that it would cost less than lc a litre, will the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> ask his Department to research this matter, inform the Senate of the result and issue an informed public statement as soon as possible? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Collins’ reference to the Uranium Advisory Council as the Commonwealth watchdog on these matters’ betrays a lack of knowledge of the arrangements that have been established for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and uranium workers in the Alligator Rivers Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As recommended by the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry under the chairmanship of  Mr Justice  Fox, the health and environmental aspects of uranium mining are regulated under applicable Northern Territory law but the supervising scientist for the Alligator Rivers region, who is appointed under Commonwealth statute, has an overall supervisory and co-ordinative role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whenever we burn coal we increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the earth’s <span class="highlight">environment</span> and its atmospheric envelope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since carbon dioxide has a very long life in the atmosphere- no-one knows precisely how long it remains in a residual concentration, but it is of the order of hundreds or thousands of years- to increase the number of coal-fired thermal generating stations does exact a real price in terms of the ecology of the earth ‘s <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel I was misrepresented this morning by the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  in his reply at the end of Question Time to a question I asked on Wednesday last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of recent statements in the media attributed to the petroleum industry that it would cost more than5c a litre to reduce existing lead levels and a counter claim by Professor Lloyd Smythe, Professor of Analytical Chemistry at the University of New South Wales, that it would cost less than1c a litre, will the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> ask his Department to research this matter, inform the Senate of the result and issue an informed public statement as soon as possible? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This morning the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  stated in his reply that the actual figure referred to by the industry was5c a gallon, not 5c a litre, hence there was no cause for disagreement, 5c a gallon being roughly1c a litre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me strange that the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> should presumably have advised the Minister to answer the question in the way he did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I readily concede- the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  will probably make the point in his closing remarks- that a levy for a similar purpose was imposed by the Federal Labor Government in 1973, but we have been persuaded to modify our view on this matter for the following reasons: Firstly, to a substantial extent, the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign is a public health measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While the Goverment is engaging in an Export Now policy, I suggest to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster),  who is at the table, and to the Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony)  that they should be looking at the promotion of Australian wine, particularly on the export market, to ensure that there are greater opportunities for Australian workers in the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> a question about the proposal to transfer to Tasmania from the Australian Capital Territory the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Division of Forest Research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> in his capacity as that Minister and as Minister representing the Minister for Housing and Construction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the Minister for Lands has under consideration a Bill to be introduced next year to amend the Lord Howe Island Act to enable the establishment on the island of reserves of national park status to be administered by the Lord Howe Island Board and that an officer of the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service nominated by the Minister for Planning and <span class="highlight">Environment</span> will be a member of the Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was dismayed to learn in answer to several questions on notice which I asked of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  that the officers of that section doing that work have been totally removed from that area for the past several years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  has now touched on a point which was raised by way of interjection by  Senator Sibraa  and which we ought to take into consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 31 May Senators Jessop and Mulvihill spoke about some aspects of the comments by the responsible Minister, on behalf of the Executive, on the results of the woodchip inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the Committee urged the Government not to issue any new woodchip licences, other than in respect of the use of sawmill waste, until environmental matters outlined in the report were resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the  Hansard  record of 3 1 May we will see that the Government’s response, through the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster),  was as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I wish to say something about this proposal, to support what the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  said and certainly to support his comment that the proposal outlined in paragraph 18 of the report should not be brought into effect by way of a Standing Order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  said caused me some concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall the report presented some time ago by the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> on the woodchip industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I decided to ask the Minister for the then Department of <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development whether any tests had been carried out during the period 1975-77 to discover whether any Commonwealth Government establishments or instrumentalities discharged effluent or waste into the Georges River in New South Wales and, if so, what had been the results ofthe tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, I asked the Minister representing the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development on 24 October last year whether any tests had been carried out during the period from 1975 to 1977 to discover whether any Commonwealth Government establishments or instrumentalities discharged effluent or waste into the Georges River in New South Wales and, if so, what had been the results of the tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Science  (Senator Webster),  representing the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development, on 1 May this year, just prior to the Parliament going into recess, replied on behalf of the Department of Defence in relation to the Holsworthy Defence establishments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the then Department of the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development found this occurring so far as discharge into the Georges River was concerned, some action should have been taken by the Department to clean up the whole situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a clear admission from the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> that the Holsworthy defence establishment and the Bankstown aerodrome are contributing to the discharge of effluent and polluted material into the Georges River. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the reply that was given to me by the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  on 1 May of this year to a question which 1 had placed on the Notice Paper on 24 October last year, it was obvious that the Holsworthy defence establishments, Federal Department of Defence establishments, and the Bankstown aerodrome- a responsibility of the Federal Department of Transport- were contributing substantially to the pollution of the Georges River. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That question was not answered until the information came to me following the transfer of responsibility for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> to my Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  has only one way out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These provisions will enable the Minister to specify detailed requirements as to the minimum numbers and qualifications pf officers and seamen to be carried in specified ships or classes of ships, to the extent that it appears necessary in the interests of safety or protection of the marine <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Is the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> aware of a report carried by the Australian Press earlier this month that an accident at the French Muroroa Atoll atomic testing range may have been responsible for several deaths, a number of other casualties and a minor tidal wave? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under this agreement the Commonwealth has undertaken to make provision that the Joint Venturers shall observe all environmental requirements specified in the conditions of the authority to mine or otherwise imposed by the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> to my question to him on Tuesday, 2 1 August 1979, relating to the position of Lord Howe Island, and to his reply the following day which merely repeated known facts as to the administration of the island, which was the reason for the complaint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The disadvantages of disposal of spent fuel or indefinite storage of the fuel is that there is a wastage of energy but, in addition, it could escape from the disposal site back to the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Crawford report, the Williams study and the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> on industrial research and development point out strongly that there is a need to increase the amount of government money going towards technology and research in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is addressed to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, is about the tragic death of a member of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition near Casey in Antarctica on 6 August this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is now under the chairmanship of  Senator Jessop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> was assigned the task of considering annual reports it was studying the Murray River report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first report that I want to refer to is the report of the Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is dealt with at some length in the statement of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other report to which the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs adverts is that of the Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One might, on reading  Hansard,  think that the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs had the temerity actually to give a report on the Senate Standing Comittee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will not respond to the science and <span class="highlight">environment</span> questions because a separate committee handled them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>: Is it a fact, as alleged in the article entitled ‘The Great Goldfish Battle’ published in the  Weekend Australian  of 1 1 and 12 August 1979, that he is introducing plans to ban imports of goldfish and some tropical fish which could wipe out the decorative aquarium industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In June this year the Prime Minister announced the Government ‘s preliminary assessment of the inhumane and environmentally damaging aspects of the seal hunt in Canada, Norway and the Soviet Union and he proposed a total ban on all seal products imported into Australia, as well as a ban on the products of all other endangered species. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This ban was referred to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> for investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is he aware that this spillage is having a deleterious effect on the local <span class="highlight">environment</span> and also could seriously affect the purification processes that the New South Wales Government has put into play in respect of the protection of the oyster industry in the area, which is an export industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What discussions, if any, have taken place between the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and officers of the Department of Transport to see that all precautions are taken to prevent spillage in advance of any tanker entering Botany Bay and discharging its cargo at Kurnell? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present the matter is not one for my Department but certainly it should be involved in the effect it is having insofar as the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has put down two reports, neither of which has resulted in a ministerial response in the relevant period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These pressures will make even more urgent the need for Australia to adjust its international structure to changes in the world trading <span class="highlight">environment</span>, an adjustment process which is now widely recognised as having been inhibited by past protection policies which have tended to shield highly protected import competing industries from the uncomfortable truths emerging from changes in international trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They constitute a change in our trading <span class="highlight">environment</span> with which Australian industry must learn to live in the years ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy of fostering industries which are unsuited to the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> is not only inimical to the development of such a trading relationship but is also exposing a widening credibility gap between our trade and foreign policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>: What research is being done in Australia by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation or other government agencies into the carcinogenic effects on workers of chemicals used in industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Budget significantly reduces the call of Government upon this nation’s financial markets and equips Australia to succeed in a world <span class="highlight">environment</span> of rising inflation and intensifying competition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want this evening to raise a matter which was raised in the Senate by  Senator Martin  on 22 August, in a question without notice to  Senator Webster,  the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, and also to refer to a report in today’s  Australian Financial Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The evidence suggests that the last few years have witnessed an unhappy industrial relations <span class="highlight">environment</span> at the Cootamundra works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would hope that the Government, and particularly the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster),  would take a very firm stand against any further reduction in the funds for these important organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the sorts of responsibilities that citizens have taken upon themselves, that is, the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in its many and varied forms, being borne in mind, it is becoming more and more important that they have the wherewithal to carry out the important function of protecting the public and community interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen abundant evidence over the last decade or so of the need for community action to bring to the attention of the bureaucracy- and government is a part of that bureaucracy- what should be its concern for protecting important matters which fall generally within the umbrella of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, that means that dedicated and concerned citizens have to identify what public authorities or the private sector will do in respect of matters affecting the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent years we have seen not only a reduction in the amount of funds provided but also in real terms a lessening of money available to the organisations at a time when development in both the public and private sectors of our economy is putting more and more pressures upon the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in its varied forms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the pleasing things we have seen in more recent years is the degree to which young people have taken upon themselves the need to protect the <span class="highlight">environment</span> from the many pressures that exist within the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Young people have a better sense of conserving our <span class="highlight">environment</span> and more concern about what is happening through the varied forms of pressure and development that take place within our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Environmental impact statements on all matters of development, whether in the private or public sector, are becoming very important from the point of view of looking at all sides of development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is sad to see the <span class="highlight">environment</span> movement, with its lack of resources, having to match the largely unlimited resources that the private sector has in these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They give up their time and need extra incentive, resources, funding and encouragement so that the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>, which, relatively, is in its infancy at this stage of our economic development, will be protected for all time, and future generations will look back and say that those who acted in a voluntary capacity and those in the Parliament both played their part to present a balanced view of development as it relates to the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To begin with, I would like to congratulate the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  and the Government on one point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the point is that the natural <span class="highlight">environment</span> of Australia is not a sectional interest; it is not a sectional viewpoint because it is a common heritage of benefit to the entire community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Democrats feel it is wrong and unfair that the attitude should be taken that these are groups of people who, for some weird reason, are concerned about the <span class="highlight">environment</span>; that it is something they own or which is to their benefit and therefore they had better get out and raise some money to protect it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From my experience of environmentalist groups, like other public causes a lot of the work is carried out by a few people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real point of the matter is that that was a confrontation between business and people concerned with the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is right and proper that there should be adequate Government funding of those concerned enough about the <span class="highlight">environment</span> to allow them to proceed with their work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, if the environmental organisations and the people who work for them have to devote a lot of their spare time to raising money, they will have less time available to do the job that they should be doing- acting out a watchdog role over environmental matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The community may well hand out the money the groups need; however, the environmentalists are people who are concerned about this national problem but who are being put at a disadvantage because effort has to go unnecessarily into that part of their task. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was advised by the environmentalist movement this morning that the dollar for dollar basis will have serious detrimental effects on a number of environmental centres that are finding it hard enough to raise funds in today’s economic climate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will cripple substantially the Darwin environmental centre, possibly the one at Townsville, and at Cairns as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably the only viable environmental centre left may be the Total <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Centre in my electorate of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Total <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Centre in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Government has ended the technical assistance grants, established under the Whitlam Government- grants of $5,000 to $7,000-which were made specifically for research into areas of concern for the <span class="highlight">environment</span> which cannot be carried out without money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those valuable grants led to the consultant study on the Border Ranges- a most important and valuable contribution to this country’s literature on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>- and the book entitled  Native Forest Ecosystems,  which are good results from what was a generally useful series of grants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement goes on to say that there is to be discussion with the non-government <span class="highlight">environment</span> and conservation groups to get their views, the views of the States and the views of the Australian Heritage Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister, in his capacity as Minister responsible for the <span class="highlight">environment</span>: What protection does he offer to the rattlesnake against the threat posed by the statement of that member of the Legislative Council that he would sooner go to bed with a rattlesnake than make a deal with the National Party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, I can assure the honourable senator that I have no competence in the matter of whether it is wise to go to bed with a rattlesnake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must express the extreme disappointment of the Opposition and particularly of myself, as a senator for the Australian Capital Territory, with the contents of the statement which the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  has just made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Government can adopt a rather more broadminded attitude, possibly look at the question from the point of view of the functions which the lighthouse can serve and then seek funding partly from what it would cost to run an automated lighthouse, partly from the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> from the point of view of the preservation of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the provision of meteorological information, partly from the point of the funding of a lifesaving station, in effect, and for various other purposes, so that together all these sources can provide the necessary funds to keep the manning of this station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As late as last week the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> was taking evidence in Perth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government can see the basis of  Senator Rae’s  concern which is, of course, about the interests of the local fishing industry and the protection of the local <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>James Webster, the Commonwealth Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>; the  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It creates a mechanism for the interest groups represented on it to provide specialised advice to the Marine Park Authority and to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is already widely used and enjoyed and effective planning of the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the reef can occur only in close cooperation with the community which will continue to use it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that the scale, diversity and complexity of the Great Barrier Reef is unmatched by any other marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>J. J. Webster, the Commonwealth Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>; the  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The marine park concept has come into being as a result of concern for the conservation of marine environments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scale, diversity and complexity of the Great Barrier Reef is unmatched by any other marine <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the world and therefore a marine park designed to allow reasonable use while conserving the Reef will differ, at least in some respects, from other models already in existence elsewhere in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommended Zoning Plan, together with representations from the public, will then be formally submitted to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> for his review, approval and subsequent tabling in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the Great Barrier Reef Consultative Committee, the Ministers noted that the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> was to announce the membership of the Committee at the conclusion ofthe meeting in terms of the attached statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council agreed to refer matters to the Consultative Committee through the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is pleased that the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  has given the Senate a full explanation of what took place in the Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Council meeting last Thursday and an opportunity to discuss it in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Day in day out we had the spectacle of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> being under siege because he failed to inform the Senate fully in relation to government intentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> said tonight that the decision on 4 June to place a ban on further exploration in the reef region was the result of the Government’s examination of the royal commissions’ report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to refer briefly to some of the specific issues arising from the statement of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general, the Australian Democrats approve of the basic sentiments expressed by the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  in this statement providedSenator Wriedt made this point- that those sentiments are supported by concrete facts; in other words, provided that the plan which emerges for the Great Barrier Reef is one which is definite and not merely, as so much of this statement is, an utterance of generalities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not allowed to occur with malice or any particular desire to destroy ecologies or the <span class="highlight">environment</span>, but they happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The growth centres that we hope ultimately will appear at Albury-Wodonga will change materially the living conditions a well as the <span class="highlight">environment</span> of those two important cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have all recognised that the tremendous, unplanned growth of our capital cities in the post-war years has been to the detriment of citizens, to the detriment of public authorities, and to the detriment of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter for great regret that this Government has taken steps to reduce the Commonwealth’s financial involvement and commitment on the other side of the coin as far as urban development is concerned- the pursuit of an active policy of decentralisation, not as a gimmick but in a way that provides opportunities for accommodation and jobs in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> that is far better than the congestion which is a characteristic of our major cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst that was in November 1975, 12 months later the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development,  Mr Newman,  announced that the Commonwealth Government would maintain support for the activities of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation by providing $21m in loan funds under the existing financial agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over a period of three years there was a funding of $90m from the Whitlam Labor Government; a promise in 1975 by  Mr Fraser  to continue a commitment to the development of growth centres; a statement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, Housing and Community Development in September or November 1976 of a loan of $22m and thereafter an amount of $5m for each of the next five years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, upon notice, on 13 September 1979: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the attention of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> been drawn to the statements made by the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory at the National Press Club yesterday where he criticised the National Parks and Wildlife Service’s active administration of the Northern Territory’s two main national parks and described it as pouring taxpayers’ money down the drain’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> to a report in the Melbourne  Herald  dated 25 September 1979 relating to the International Whaling Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I direct my question to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the exercise of that control, the policies of the Government which would be relevant include its policies with respect to marketing, safeguards and the protection of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in this <span class="highlight">environment</span> that we see the present Government’s continuing program of heavy overseas borrowings as creating current and contingent problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On Wednesday 16 May a staff member of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, during informal discussions with members of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, referred to press reports of the presence of the survey vessel  Eugene McDermott II  off the Queensland coast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Is the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> aware that the proposed second section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park lies between Lizard Island and Innisfail? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> to a statement made yesterday by  Mr Viner,  the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, in which he linked the Unemployed Workers Union to the Australian Conservation Foundation because both organisations, together with a number of other organisations, share a particular post box in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister able to confirm that this post office box number is the address for groups which share the facilities of the Canberra and South East Region <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Centre? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government is approaching finalisation of a redraft of this code to include it in the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a real people’s movement which began at the grass roots level and sought to bring about, through the enactment of government legislation, a recognition of the need for us to apply ourselves to conserving our resources and our natural <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have regarded land in the proper light; they have regarded land as part of their home <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I say that there is no appeals provision in the present legislation, I am saying that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in relation to the rights of the subject, the rights of the citizen, has changed considerably in the last few years as a result of legislation of the previous Government and of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation should be made consistent with that changed <span class="highlight">environment</span> in relation to these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One must consider the rest of the islands and accept the special responsibility to see that the <span class="highlight">environment</span> is not interrupted, not destroyed and not overprotected, although I am not suggesting that it should be overprotected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am trying to say that the report seems to have arrived at the only solution for the area- recognition of the rights of Papua New Guinea and the protection of the peoples and the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A lifestyle is developing which to my mind is equal, if not superior, to our town, when one considers the beauty of the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if we go there let us do so without damaging the <span class="highlight">environment</span> by bringing in some of the rather superficial, commercial, shallow attitudes and ways that we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wish to address some remarks this evening to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> entitled Industrial Research and Development in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Departments of Productivity and Science (now the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>) study the operations of the (UK) National Research Development Corporation and other similar bodies, in order to identify the detailed requirements and terms of reference for an Australian equivalent for consideration by the Government; and that following consideration of the above study, an NRDClike body be established in Australia, financed in the first instance by a government loan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard  tables from pages 77 and 85 of the report of the Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> on gross expenditure on research and development on a per capita basis and as a percentage of the gross domestic product in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries since 1 973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and I have spent time at Siding Springs and know of the importance of astronomical and astrophysical research in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The growth of public disenchantment with the role of science and technology is the result of several factors, including the military applications of scientific discoveries, a questioning of the true value of high-cost technology such as space exploration, and the impact of science and technology on the <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I compliment  Senator Puplick  on his wide-ranging and erudite remarks on the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> which is before the Senate, particularly his remarks concerning the importance of science and technology to the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So even though I am a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, I cannot commend the Committee so strongly for what it has done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the Committee wishes to point out that by offering a protected economic <span class="highlight">environment</span>, any government to a large extent renders inoperative one of the outstanding factors which produce innovative activity: the profit motive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubts about that at all, I make a plea to the Government to take notice of the Crawford report on structural employment in the country, the Industries Assistance Commission report on manufacturing industries and, to a lesser degree, the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> on industrial research and development in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 31 May 1979 the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  presented a statement purporting to be a response from the Government to the recommendations arising from my Committee’s inquiry into the impact on the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span> of the woodchip industry program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Committee, and the earlier committee on social <span class="highlight">environment</span> chaired by  Senator Keeffe  worked extremely hard for over two years on this reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 29 August this year I asked the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  whether he was aware of a report carried by the Australian Press earlier in the month that an accident at the French Mururoa Atoll atomic testing range may have been responsible for several deaths, a number of other casualties and a minor tidal wave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw to the attention of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> a report in the  Bulletin  of 2 October relating to Taiwanese fishing poachers alleged to be operating on the Great Barrier Reef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a result of this, as  Senator Knight  has mentioned, legislation is being considered to re-establish in the Australian Capital Territory an <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which orderly and efficient marketing can occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that clause is not directed to dealing with that particular problem, and the quarantine may have lost power once pratique is granted, then I think the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  may care to tell the Senate whether it is intended to deal with it by either an amendment to this Bill or at some stage in the very near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite complete agreement with the statements made in the second reading speech, an abundance of time during the long drawn-out reply of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  to everyone who supported him left me unsatisfied with the wording of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter that I too would like the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  to answer relates to clause 6 which proposes to insert new section 69A(7) which states that an owner is not entitled to compensation if, in the case of his not being notified by the quarantine officer of the destruction of goods, the goods have been destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  can say what the Department believes and  Senator Teague  can say what a good Minister will do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I express my dissatisfaction very briefly at the answer given by the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  to  Senator Cavanagh  concerning clause 6 which seeks to insert a new section 69 ( 1 ) in the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> said in some of his replies to  Senator Cavanagh  that this might cover a case where the owner had already recovered moneys through some other form of indemnity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I did not think I would have to speak to the motion for the third reading of the Bill but my contribution has been brought about by a statement made by the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  in his reply to the second reading debate when he made mention of the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory in Victoria and said that primary producers should be grateful to his Government for establishing the laboratory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable senator knows, the monitoring procedures which are being set up, basically through the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and the Department of Primary Industry, call for six-day reports on the catches that are being taken, in an effort to get some permanent record of the living resources that are available in these waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that he, as a Government senator, will be aware that this Government has done a great deal towards encouraging research and development in this country, not only through what I believe to be the great reservoir of funds which have been projected into areas of research undertaken by the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and organisations within its responsibility, but also through the funds which have been projected into the Department of Productivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer the honourable senator to page 2208 of the House of Representatives  Hansard,  of 18 October 1979, the  Chairman  of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and Conservation, which had just presented its report, stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee notes that Victoria is the only State which, at present, has comprehensive <span class="highlight">environment</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been aware of, and have read, the article in the  Age  which speaks of environmental legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As he will know, meetings of the Australian <span class="highlight">Environment</span> Council are held regularly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to comment in particular on the statement of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  about the Kakadu National Park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He says in his statement that the Park is an area of outstanding natural beauty and contains much of scientific, cultural and environmental interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every bit of spoil taken from that mine will go through the crusher and will finally end up carefully contained in a rock and earth tailings dam where it can be held because of the danger to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> below it of the heavy metals used in uranium processing, to say nothing of the possibility of some residual radioactivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe- I did raise this point with the people of Ranger- that environmental measures there have been scrupulously abided by. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I enter this debate simply to say that all that we have heard from the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  and what is in the minds of  Senator Robertson  and the  Deputy  Leader of the Australian Democrats  (Senator Mason)  simply justifies  Senator Webster’s  forming an alliance with the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply make the plea that I hope the Government will grasp what I have suggested previously and that the Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> will be given permanent statutory authority to maintain a form of auxiliary monitoring system and, if necessary, for trespassers into the park or into whaling to be given the opportunity to put testimony before that Committee under the chairmanship of  Senator Jessop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to ask a question that I would like to have asked at Question Time but did not have the opportunity to do so, perhaps largely due to the extensive answers given by the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  to several questions posed to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-70">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question for passage to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Fife)  by the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, who is in the chamber, is simply: Will the Minister urgently consider the removal of such restrictions as exist either on the issuing of licences or the imposition of excise on the construction and operation of a distillation plant to manufacture power alcohol from vegetable matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-70">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of the warnings by  Dr Mark  Harris, a Sydney paediatrician attached to the environmental health group of the inner Sydney regional council for social development, that the concentration of carbon monoxide and other pollutants in the atmosphere in south-western and centra] Sydney was sufficient to exacerbate bronchia-pneumonic and respiratory complaints in children and heart disease in adults. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I must express the view of the Federal Opposition with regard to the report that the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  has just put down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>-If Senator Puplick takes that view he might be more in touch with what is happening in our universities and in the employment market than is the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Senator Webster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>asked the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, upon notice, on 22 August 1979: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-59-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, arises out of the report of the Australian Research Grants Committee which he tabled yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Macphee ‘s Department is also involved in research on improving the physical working <span class="highlight">environment</span> in Australian industry and issues publications for use in industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am advised by the Minister for Productivity that he places a high priority on reducing the incidence of occupational accidents and on improving the physical working <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Advice has been received from the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and from the Australian Radiation Laboratory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The CSIRO is not aware of any studies being undertaken in Australia aimed at determining whether the electric charges on particles emitted from chimney stacks have any effects in the immediate <span class="highlight">environment</span> of coal-fired power stations but has good reason to believe that such effects will be minimal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there appears to be no evidence that the chemical nature of these particles produces any adverse environmental effects which should cause concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the changing <span class="highlight">environment</span>, the rising standard of living and the tremendous population growth that was brought about substantially by Federal Government migration programs in the post-war years, we need to recognise that local government cannot be expected to provide all of the funds to create a reasonable <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which people may live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has an important role to play in improving the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in which people live and in providing a range of facilities which perhaps were not even dreamt of when local government first established its franchise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> whether his attention has been drawn to a report in the  Australian Financial Review  of yesterday’s date which suggests that the production of medical isotopes at Lucas Heights, Sydney, can be done much more cheaply and much more safely by a machine known as a cyclotron. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As late as last week, the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> received very important evidence in Adelaide about the protection of marine mammals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know of their likely tendency, in the Australian <span class="highlight">environment</span>, to approach a Bill of rights with the same degree of application as they would approach a dog Act or a tax Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can recall that when I was Chairman of the Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Environment</span> a number of years ago when we had a senior official from the Department of Aboriginal and Islander Advancement before the Committee- admittedly both sides of the Committee, members of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party, by this time were obviously pretty good cross-examiners- our reward for the further cross-examination of DAIA officers was an instruction from the Premier that never again was any member of his Department of  Aboriginal  and Islander Advancement to appear before that particular Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Minister has received the report from the National Health and Medical Research Council I feel sure that he would make reference to those matters raised with regard to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> and the difficulties that can be experienced by people who live in an <span class="highlight">environment</span> where there is exposure to chemicals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>asked the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, upon notice, on 10 October 1979: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, upon notice, on 23 October 1979: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This centre, which is known as the NASCOM Switching Centre, is staffed and operated by officers of the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this place, none other than the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Senator Webster,  weighed in on the doctrine of ministerial responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notified  Senator Webster,  as the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, that I proposed to speak in relation to a follow-on from the decision of the Government regarding the recommencement of exports of kangaroo products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw to the attention of the Senate that when an Estimates committee was dealing with the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>- and with the role of  Senator Webster’s  officers who were more or less acting in concert with the State- it was told that the United States Government had not made a decision in regard to the importation of kangaroo products from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> and ask whether the Minister has read an article in the Press of 5 November reporting a claim by an eminent United States scientist  Dr Roy  that he has discovered a process to reverse phenomena that occur during nuclear fission chain reaction thus making radioactive waste harmless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> whether the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation’s Division of Radiophysics has the necessary equipment and qualified personnel to carry out a program of search for extra-terrestrial intelligence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council on radioactive waste management is not yet available to honourable senators but, according to the account of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster),  it is a moderate statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Government has to concede that there is genuine concern in the Australian community about the problems of radioactive waste management and that, in fact, on all occasions when this matter has been checked by the pollsters a degree of concern and apprehension has been shown as to the actions the Government will take in protecting not only the present <span class="highlight">environment</span> but also the future <span class="highlight">environment</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This in itself, I submit, requires a measure of social control which can only erode civil liberties and hard-won industrial rights and which obviously threatens the <span class="highlight">environment</span> if governments do not see their responsibility to adopt a policy and a process which protect not only the present <span class="highlight">environment</span> but also the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in the thousands of years that lie ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> has made several visits to the region and has seen certain revised techniques which may reduce the environmental strains on the Alligator Rivers system, I do not want to see in 1982 a virtual changing of the guard with a new Supervising Scientist because in the tooling-up period of acquiring a certain awareness there could be breaches of environmental codes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this report had been tabled 48 hours earlier it could have been perused by a number of honourable senators who are aware that the Supervising Scientist is the virtual environmental custodian of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that in the statement the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition would like some assurance from the Minister that when these sorts of conflicts of interest manifest themselves, the Government will back an objective look at the matter and recognise our commitment to Aborigines, not our commitment to multinational mining companies, many of which are foreign owned and have shown in a historical sense all over the world that they are interested in development for their short term purposes and that they have not really appreciated the damage that they have done to the <span class="highlight">environment</span> in various countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is worth asking the Government at this stage, through the Minister or through the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster),  just when it does propose to declare stage 2 of the park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another point is what environmental effect it will have on the Kakadu National Park in view of the uniquely primeval nature of that park, where we will need to have a guaranteed zero effect on the <span class="highlight">environment</span> if we are to preserve it into the indefinite future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stage 2 of the Kakadu National Park, as he mentioned, is more the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster),  to whom I will refer his remarks for consideration and reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, a number of amendments to the Bill we considered previously arose as a result of the discussions which took place between the University representatives and the members of the Government parties on the education, science and the <span class="highlight">environment</span> committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As it appears that the Minister for Transport and his Department are not particularly interested in retaining any form of manning for that lighthouse, will the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> endeavour to co-ordinate an approach involving the Tasmanian Government, the Bureau of Meteorology, the maritime services rescue coordination centre and the various other organisations which have been referred to in questions which have been asked in this chamber over a period of 12 months or more, in order to put together a plan which will enable that lighthouse to continue to be manned for all the purposes which have been made so clear so often in this chamber? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The installation of automatic measuring facilities means that so far as the Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> is concerned the lighthouse need not be manned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee considers that the reduction in the number of fish species approved for importation cannot be justified on quarantine grounds and recommends that further investigations be undertaken to establish the environmental issues involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to refer to a Department of Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> assessment report on the proposed Nabarlek uranium project, dated February this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter refers to environmental regulatory studies in the Northern Territory pertaining to the mining of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently, consideration of the estimates under Group A was postponed as the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Senator Webster,  who was then at the table, undertook to obtain some information for the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek clarification from the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster),  whether my interpretation of that paragraph is accurate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>,  Senator Webster  - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will take them in sequence if that is all right with the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  to whom I have already spoken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of urgency could you kindly ask the Minister for Science and <span class="highlight">Environment</span> the following: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I asked the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  who represents the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  might have misheard me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is incomprehensible to me that the Government should expect co-operation from members of the Opposition when very little justice is given to our colleagues- especially my colleague  Senator Walsh,  who has now been removed from the chamber, not for one day but for one week- and when the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  sits mute after reasonable requests have been made for information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having made those comments I draw the attention of the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  and the Committee to the report of the Senate Estimates Committee D as it relates to the National Capital Development Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>  (Senator Webster)  can inform us what is the anticipated target by the Defence Service for new homes and to what extent that target has been met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator McLaren frightens me by saying that we may be doing a serious injustice to primary producers by agreeing to this appropriation simply because the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> does not have the explanation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we are asking is for the Minister for Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span>, who has been asleep all night, to repeat the information to us now so that we know that there is no injustice to the primary producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of Australia’s relatively high technology, resource and economic potential and its potential to maintain sizable, modern defence forces, there is an important role for it to play in providing stability within its area of strategic <span class="highlight">environment</span>- the South Pacific, the southern and eastern Indian Ocean, and the island chain to our north. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his second reading speech, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  said that one of the early objectives of the Institute would be to define multiculturalism and then to follow that through with various worthy aims, which would include the development of awareness among cultural and ethnic groups, the promotion of tolerance, understanding and mutual esteem, the promotion of cohesiveness through existing political and legal structures, and the promotion of an <span class="highlight">environment</span> conducive to participation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether all members of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> share my view, but I believe that one of the problems we have to live with is the advent of the multinational company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That aside, the final report from the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> in relation to research and development makes it obvious that Australians want more encouragement in this technological battle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I explained more fully in my Second Reading Speech, the essential basis of a patent system is to assist indigenous industrial development by enabling local industry to exploit new technological developments, initially, by the provision of an economic <span class="highlight">environment</span> within which to create a commercial market by excluding competition through the grant of a patent and, subsequently, by the disclosure of the necessary information enabling industry generally to fully utilise those developments on the expiry of the patent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to believe that when there are problems in this area from time to time, the unanimous recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the <span class="highlight">Environment</span> would mean that the Government would use those recommendations as the structure on which to base further legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
