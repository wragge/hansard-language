    <p>But while this Government persists in its attempts to make laws in this matter and <span class="highlight">races</span> ahead with something at 1 o’clock in the morning will we continually be asked to accept something like this just to clear things up? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is time that we got our priorities right, got down to governing this country, running this Parliament as it should be run and forgot about blooming horse <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are not kept separately according to <span class="highlight">races</span> but those who have abstracted them, in what is, at any rate, a high degree of likelihood as to selection of race, show that in those considered to be Aboriginals there is a very, very high mortality rate indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What hypocrisy it is to say that of the Aswan Dam and at the same time to train terrorists in the use of explosives and in destruction and to supply them with explosives to stop construction of the Cabora Bassa Dam on the lower Zambesi in Mozambique which will produce almost twice as much electricity as the Aswan Dam and will provide irrigation and all sorts of aids to raise the standard of living of all the <span class="highlight">races</span> in the surrounding areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prohibition of Mixed Marriage Act 1949 bans all intermarriage between people of different <span class="highlight">races</span> and the Immorality Amendment Act 1950 makes it an offence, punishable by 5 years imprisonment, for a male and 4 years for a female, for a European and a non-European, to have sexual intercourse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is consequently an inbuilt distortion of the relations between the two <span class="highlight">races</span> and that distortion will persist as long as we arc there as rulers rather than helpers and neighbours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is good reason to suppose that there will be advantage to the Territory of Papua and New Guinea if all <span class="highlight">races</span> are enabled to exist side by side and to work together towards an economic plan and in, what is probably slightly more difficult, a sociological fashion, and towards more political awareness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is difficult to avoid oversimplification but, in broad terms, we can view the people as consisting of the more sophisticated coastal <span class="highlight">races</span> and the less sophisticated, down to completely primitive, highlanders and back country tribes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Aboriginals, especially children, are far more susceptible to leprosy than white <span class="highlight">races</span>; we expect to find the disease amongst the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 would like to make it plain that I do not agree with the policy of apartheid as practised by the South African Government, particularly that section which is commonly known in that country as petty apartheid, nor would the policy of separate development be my answer to the problems facing the various <span class="highlight">races</span> of South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This decision alone has caused more harm and more division between <span class="highlight">races</span> than any other decision that has been made by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is based on keeping a homogeneous population and avoiding the tensions which inevitably occur when people of different <span class="highlight">races</span>, traditions and cultures are indiscriminately thrown together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock)  have come into this chamber today, deliberately setting out to stir up racial hatred and racial intolerance because they believe that latent in the Australian community is an antipathy towards people with coloured skins or people of different <span class="highlight">races</span> and origins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those of us who have had a part to play in the task that has been placed upon this Parliament to ameliorate the lot of the Australian Aboriginal people will know that it is an enormously difficult task, compounded not so much by the Aboriginal people themselves but by a couple of hundred years of search or no search on the part of governments, of the great difficulties of the continental scope of the question and the sheer fact that in relationships between people of different cultures, different <span class="highlight">races</span> and so on humanity has not really found an answer in many parts of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is nonsense to talk in this way because people are different, individuals are different, groups are different and of course <span class="highlight">races</span> are different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the Doomben <span class="highlight">races</span> in Brisbane on Saturday I was not accosted and directed that I should expend my energies and enterprise and what initiative I may have on seeking to bring enlightenment to the Parliament upon this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the singular contributions to that gathering of distress has been the conflict between and among <span class="highlight">races</span>- the fact that men and women of different <span class="highlight">races</span> have had difficulty in living with each other, abiding with each other, respecting each other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Having just listened to about half an hour of verbosity from the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  who sits opposite, I state that I still have no possible explanation of why he is really opposed to this legislation except to conclude that what he really seeks is to perpetuate in this country the existing situation in which people can and do commit acts which discriminate against people of particular <span class="highlight">races</span> and hide behind supposed rights at law in order to protect themselves from being brought to justice for committing these acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are dealing tonight with discrimination- not only racial discrimination but discrimination against people of different nationalities as well as of different <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the time of Wilberforce there was no such thing as race prejudice- other <span class="highlight">races</span> simply were inferior. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the Government that there is room in the context of this debate for the view that the real path to tolerance between the <span class="highlight">races</span> and between persons of different race is not primarily to be found through legislative coercion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation in its amended form, which we welcome and which we support, now conforms to the Opposition’s view that the best way to promote harmony between the <span class="highlight">races</span> in Australia is through the process of conciliation, education and- one hopes, in the long term- greater understanding between the <span class="highlight">races</span> without the existence of legislative coercion of the type originally proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Obviously there would be some who would do so but the vast majority of medical practitioners do not get up in the morning and say: ‘I lost $200 at the <span class="highlight">races</span> yesterday so I have to do 2 extra appendectomies’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are not suggesting that doctors- to use the example cited by the honourable member- will operate on people just because they have a loss at the <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not believe that it does anybody’s cause any good when bad judgment such as we see in the purchase of that house increases tension between the <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Too often we have seen the dangers and tragic consequences of inflaming Australians against people of other <span class="highlight">races</span>, whether they be Chinese, Japanese, Arabs or Indonesians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My mind <span class="highlight">races</span> back rapidly to the days when we were in Opposition and the then Prime Minister, John Grey Gorton, was having trouble with the medical profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was also based on the eagerness of the Labor Party to throw crumbs to an absolutely misguided intellectual Left which has little interest in the love and understanding between <span class="highlight">races</span> that we on the Government side believe in and are working towards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Like most emergent <span class="highlight">races</span> throughout the world the Aborigines, with few exceptions, have found themselves admirably suited to participation in an enterprise which is structured along co-operative lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In actual fact, it was a very important referendum for Territorians because it concerned the Constitutional change which gave the Commonwealth Government the right to make laws for all <span class="highlight">races</span> in Australia, which of course, included Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 think it would be quite unreasonable to suggest that we can keep the two <span class="highlight">races</span> apart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certain people would like to close overnight the gap between the Aboriginal and European <span class="highlight">races</span> in Australia, which has been created over thousands of years by the two <span class="highlight">races</span> living apart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that many mistakes have been made in the past and that it would be more realistic if these same people who are now critical put their weight behind the integration of the two <span class="highlight">races</span>, using the facts of the past, and not into an attempt to achieve what they would like to see happen in the short term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
