<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I state for the benefit of those members of the Labor Party who have not bothered to read their own Government’s Bill that this clause deals with the provision as to <span class="highlight">races</span> disqualified from voting <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People go to the <span class="highlight">races</span> and hope to win a few more dollars, but racing is subject to strict controls in the interest of the punting investor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy that the Government is carrying out today is the same policy that the German Fascists carried out against the Jews, the Poles and other <span class="highlight">races</span> in Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In considering applications, the Commission does not distinguish between applicants of different <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This inter-racial seminar was convened for the purpose of assisting the local aboriginal population as well as people of other <span class="highlight">races</span> in every possible way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>people of different <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government has extended its policy now to include Europeans and people of other <span class="highlight">races</span> who possess the skills which Australia needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this instance the Government is discriminating between the <span class="highlight">races</span> in providing assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Extreme right wing sections of the American community have been able to establish private armies, particularly for the purpose of subduing the coloured <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Daly,  a renowned colleague of mine, pointed out that the increase represents merely one unit with the Totalisator Agency Board, or tote as he called it, at the Canberra <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the Government is not even considering that the pensioners might have a bet at the <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Offices ‘eel that this is justified as their premium rates are based on the mortality experience of lives of predominantly European extraction and there is evidence that the mortality experience of a number of non-European <span class="highlight">races</span> is less favourable than that of Europeans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710420_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They feel that because of the undoubted hostility that exists between the 2 <span class="highlight">races</span> in that country their position would be prejudiced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would need lo have regard to the problems  Senator Gair  mentioned - the difficulty of centralisation in a country so mixed in dialects in tribes, <span class="highlight">races</span> and ethnic characteristics, and the cost of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711102_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do many countries in Africa practise apartheid between their constituent <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such restrictions are not generally regarded as a manifestation of apartheid which is concerned with the separation of <span class="highlight">races</span> within a community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They did not want coloured <span class="highlight">races</span> allowed into this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From my point of view, it could be more intensively applied as far as the quality of migrants that we get from countries which do not have coloured <span class="highlight">races</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us be like other people - black, white and yellow <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People have their own attitudes towards people of other <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt will include re-runs of all Melbourne <span class="highlight">races</span> and the Sydney double, an expansion of features on  Sportsaction  and demonstrations by Australia’s Olympics athletes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Bonner, unlike some others, does not distinguish between <span class="highlight">races</span> in the way in which some members of the Labor Party are prepared to adopt a racial approach to their attitudes in relation to these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same way, the people who were forcibly incorporated in the new state without regard to the wishes of most of them were Serbs, Croats, Slavs, Albanians, Dalmatians, Italians and several other <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They may be more interested, as  Senator Webster  suggested - and I remind  Senator Webster  that not only the poor go to the <span class="highlight">races</span> - in backing winners on a Saturday than providing a highly intelligent young person who may be studying medicine at a university until he is  24  or  25  years of age with means which will enable him to live as a young person of that age ought to be able to live, at a reasonable standard in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the whole situation underlines the unfortunate elements which exist with competition between 2 <span class="highlight">races</span> in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were the sort of things which helped to sustain them in the environment in which they were forced to extract a living - which they did - and which would have caused many other <span class="highlight">races</span> and many other nationalities to disappear from the face of the earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much more than many <span class="highlight">races</span> of people who have been caught in similar types of primitive life, although not to the same extreme degree, they submit to medical attention and care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Requirements for protective helmets for motorcycle <span class="highlight">races</span> are not specified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The might and the power of the Commonwealth may well be mustered without any constitutional inhibitions to sever these islands from the State of Queensland, to completely truncate part of a nation, a total ethnic group, and put it in another nation embracing a multitude of <span class="highlight">races</span> with which it would be totally alien. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, we have seen how it <span class="highlight">races</span> off to China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one of the exciting and dynamic <span class="highlight">races</span> and nations in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every Australian who loves horse <span class="highlight">races</span> thinks that the introduction of that system of voting is a wonderful suggestion, but it would be a bad voting system in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought it was worse than Randwick <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is always saying everything bad about <span class="highlight">races</span> other than our own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I plead with those of the non-Aboriginal <span class="highlight">races</span> who are part of the so-called backlash to try to understand that what is being done by governments is the true entitlement of the indigenous people who have been dispossessed of what was truly theirs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that no less a man than  Mr Egerton  was discussing the matter at the <span class="highlight">races</span> a week ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equal representation of all citizens of all places as well as of all <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have recently, by enfranchising Aborigines, moved to equal representation of all <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this type of treatment make it extremely difficult to create better understanding between the <span class="highlight">races</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the early period of Asian history China, the Mongols and many different <span class="highlight">races</span> had in one way or another invaded and attempted to occupy the region known as Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, of course, has followed the wonderful and exciting boom of the 1960s, when we had people punting on the stock and share market in much the same way as people punt on the <span class="highlight">races</span>, and they were enjoying it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe this ought to be exposed to the people so that the people of Mediterranean <span class="highlight">races</span>, for example- I think there are nearly one million of that descent in Australia- can make up their own minds about the authenticity of these companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No country on earth has solved the problem of inter-racial relations especially when those <span class="highlight">races</span> are living side by side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far from eliminating racial discrimination by making it illegal, the Bill will highlight the problems between the <span class="highlight">races</span> and create an official race relations industry with a staff of dedicated anti-racists earning their living by making the most of every complaint in much the same way as does the Race Relations Board in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A presumption of inferiority in respect of certain <span class="highlight">races</span> is the only interpretation which can be put on the policy of some of the major insurance companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It says that Mediterranean <span class="highlight">races</span> are not eligible for weekly benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet these insurance companies say that the Mediterranean <span class="highlight">races</span> are not eligible for weekly benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the updated manual of the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd still proposes that people of Mediterranean <span class="highlight">races</span> shall not have the benefit of insurance unless they can speak, write and understand the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The New School- the Nouvelle Ecole- founded on evolution, is committed to playing out 2 theses of neo-Darwinism and polygenesis and to underlining the inequalities and the profound differences which are alleged to exist between the <span class="highlight">races</span> and to translating various degrees of evolution in the transforming movement of these <span class="highlight">races</span> towards new species ‘between which unions will probably be no longer be fertile’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are so many countries on the African continent that one gets mixed up in the <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a division because of <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fights between <span class="highlight">races</span> have taken place in Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the difficulties and these are the things that are going on amongst the people of the different coloured <span class="highlight">races</span> in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their researches go dangerously close to suggesting that perhaps there are basic inherited racial differences which ought to give rise to different policies for dealing with different <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I honestly think that this legislation could be the means of insulting that section of the new <span class="highlight">races</span> we have in Australia because it implies racial discrimination in an area in which I think it does not exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were people of other <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That 99 per cent are people of other <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The African slave era developed theories that there were differences between <span class="highlight">races</span>, differences in habits, attitudes and beliefs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Far from eliminating racial discrimination by making it illegal, the Bill will highlight the problems between the <span class="highlight">races</span> and create an official race relations industry with a staff of dedicated anti-racists earning their living by making the most of every complaint in much the same way as does the Race Relations Board in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fear that I have is that if one puts up any proposition relating to the question of possible differences between <span class="highlight">races</span> one is going to find necessarily that the person is actuated by some bad motive because what he is doing is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust, dangerous and without any justification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is an example of racial discrimination between people of 2 coloured <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Everyone, whatever his race, is proud of his race and naturally is suspicious of people of other <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There can be no doubt that both Aboriginal and European <span class="highlight">races</span> must be given every opportunity to develop together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ‘Battle of Mitchell’ (River), some 180 miles south of Aurukun in 1864; the guerrilla-type campaign sustained over 7 years against the gold miners on the Palmer River, a tributary of the Mitchell, from 187S on; and other incidents, led ‘The Queenslander’ (May 1, 1880) to refer to ‘a sickening and brutal war of the <span class="highlight">races</span>, requiring either improved police methods, or the delaying of settlement - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Much is going on now between the 2 <span class="highlight">races</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply say, along the lines of the interjection by  Senator Georges,  that successive Australian governments have adopted a policy of the blending of people of all <span class="highlight">races</span> and all complexions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those of us who tend to regret very much the difficulties that alcohol has created and so on should remind ourselves that it is largely because of the demoralisation of <span class="highlight">races</span> of people whose purpose of living had been largely destroyed, whose dignity had been threatened, that these people are seeking escape in drink, gambling, petrol sniffing and in the general opting out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Sheil  told us that the goal of apartheid itself is self government; that this is something we should all applaud; that what distinguishes the policy of apartheid from other policies is that it is honest; that it arises because of the curious development of South Africa whereby a number of people of different <span class="highlight">races</span> have come from different parts of the world and congregated within the same relatively small country; and that it arose out of the necessity of the situation to keep the various ethnic and cultural groups apart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that everyone accepts the apartheid laws; that they are necessary because people of different <span class="highlight">races</span> do not get on and they like to have things regulated in that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were these honest people whom  Senator Sheil  has spoken about, who did talk about total territorial apartheid- the division of the whole of South Africa on an equitable basis amongst the <span class="highlight">races</span> so that they could all be allocated territories in which they could work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the basis of this separatism the principle that the two <span class="highlight">races</span> shall not mix? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is only in recent centuries, largely due to the technology of the white man, that we have begun to mix up the <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present it appears to me that of all the different coloured <span class="highlight">races</span> on the earth today only one race is being used for world wide political warfare, and that is the black race. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their capture was not merely due to the fact that the Europeans had firearms, although that fact alone indicates a difference in aptitudes and abilities between the two <span class="highlight">races</span>, but many were captured by other negroes and sold to European and Arab slavers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The caste system cannot last indefinitely when two <span class="highlight">races</span> have nearly the same aptitudes and abilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All <span class="highlight">races</span> are different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My thesis is that all men of all <span class="highlight">races</span> are equal but different- and thank God they are so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Inter-breeding between the <span class="highlight">races</span> is equally futile as a policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 notice in yesterday’s  Hansard  that, when reference was made to a visit to Meekatharra by me and  Senator Rocher, Senator Keeffe  is recorded to have interjected saying that we went to the <span class="highlight">races</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since we were there two days before the <span class="highlight">races</span> to attend a meeting of pastoralists and graziers, I thought that  Senator Keeffe  might like to withdraw that interjection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government Whip suddenly <span class="highlight">races</span> through the door and starts to complain about the comments I am making, let him reflect very carefully on just what we are going to be doing between 9.30 and 10.30 tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Contrary to popular belief there are a large number of resorts, hotels, restaurants, theatres, sports grounds, game reserves and other facilities in South Africa which are open to all <span class="highlight">races</span> including coloured people who live in the Republic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are persons receiving unemployment benefit who have had a win at the <span class="highlight">races</span> or who have collected prizes at bingo or on poker machines obliged to record their win in statements of income required fortnightly by the Department of Social Security? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council forgets the fact that the Australian public voted in 1967, by an overwhelming majority, that there should be special laws for people of particular <span class="highlight">races</span>, and this included the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope, for the future of this country and all the <span class="highlight">races</span> who inhabit it, including the Aboriginal race, that the Government is sincere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that they are hypocritical, taking into account the attitude the Government is taking to certain <span class="highlight">races</span> and nationalities in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I maintain that this Government picks and chooses between the <span class="highlight">races</span> and countries from which it chooses those migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>10) Your petitioners in the Gap area are distressed by fears that the continued peaceful integrated existence of the <span class="highlight">races</span> will be disrupted by your crash assimilation program and friction between the <span class="highlight">races</span> will be thus fostered and fanned <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After the American civil war those rights were extended to the Negroes and people of other <span class="highlight">races</span> and colours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That whereas the ‘Have a go, Australia’ advertisements currently screened on commercial television portray an Australian continent populated entirely by people with pink, anglo-saxon faces and whereas this has the effect of presenting an image at variance to our real situation of a population drawn from many <span class="highlight">races</span> and cultures and whereas, in particular, the ‘Have a go, Australia’ advertising ignores the Aboriginal people and their culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is more than enough Anglo-Saxon prejudice without allowing us to involve resentment between peoples of different colours or different <span class="highlight">races</span> and from different continents in such an institute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to the support given on behalf of the Government by  Senator Chaney,  the strong stand abroad of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  against actions which disadvantage other <span class="highlight">races</span> must surely lead him towards supporting this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
