    <p>The Commission granted the stay of proceedings because of the general case for equal pay, and instead of those who were ultimately to become entitled to the male rate getting the male rate qualifications to date from 1968, they now have to wail until 1972 before they will qualify for the full male rate, because even when the Commission finally agreed that some of the females employed by Commonwealth Hostels Ltd fell within this miserable little 9-point formula which the Government adheres to so strongly the Government still refused to backdate their qualification eligibility to the date on which it first applied, because even the Commission, to its discredit, insisted that no <span class="highlight">female</span> can ever get the male rate instantly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Oddly enough, in the metropolitan area according to the statistics in regard to <span class="highlight">female</span> unemployed, there were 9,800 job seekers and potentially 17,000 available jobs, which would seem to throw some doubt on the descriptive classification between jobs and job seekers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is proposed that all <span class="highlight">female</span> workers who are not doing the same or similar work to males should be given a substantial wage increase, the cost, of course, could be considerable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Particulars of wages and salaries paid are not available for males and females separately from the sources used for this series; average weekly earnings are therefore calculated in terms of male units, i.e. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The level of this ratio is affected by the factthat the proportion of females in lower paid occupations is greater than that for males, and that overtime and over-award payments constitute a higher proportion of male than of <span class="highlight">female</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>provide in our proposed amendment that a temporary employee shall take leave of absence and be entitled to be paid maternity leave and such leave benefits on account of pregnancy as are applicable to a <span class="highlight">female</span> officer, that is, a full time teacher under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final part of the amendment concerns the pregnancy of <span class="highlight">female</span> teachers and the fact that general Commonwealth Public Service provisions which are laid down for them are inadequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the plain fact is that clause 33 allows pregnant <span class="highlight">female</span> teachers to take off a period of duty not exceeding 26 weeks of which something like 20 weeks can be before confinement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I do not really see at this point that there is a great bone of contention there but it may be that the honourable member for Fremantle is right in wanting a greater latitude and flexibility of operation in that circumstance with regard to <span class="highlight">female</span> members of the fraternity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member went on to say  -  I will not labour the point now, and that is not meant to be a pun - that there is a distinct difference between a <span class="highlight">female</span> clerk working in comparative secrecy or isolation and a teacher who has to stand before a class. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, you cannot liken the position of a pregnant teacher to that of any other <span class="highlight">female</span> in the Public Service who might be in that condition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Chairman, the amendment that the Opposition has moved is in relation to the matter of leave for a <span class="highlight">female</span> officer in the case of pregnancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">female</span> temporary employee who has become pregnant shall take leave of absence and be entitled to paid maternity leave and such leave benefits &lt;on account of pregnancy as are applicable to a <span class="highlight">female</span> officer in accordance with this section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What the Australian Labor Party is proposing is that there be a more generous provision for <span class="highlight">female</span> officers whether they be temporary or permanent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it ought to be an accepted part of our procedures that a pregnancy is treated in a special way in respect of <span class="highlight">female</span> employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, as far as I can hear, the only proposition which has come forward as persuasive argument in relation to special treatment is that there may be cause for embarrassment for the <span class="highlight">female</span> pregnant teacher in front of a class. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think that it is a little out of keeping with the general context of our social environment at the moment for it to be proposed that the average <span class="highlight">female</span> teacher might suffer undue embarrassment in the early or middle stages of pregnancy by being in front of a class. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It must be realised that, as far as the <span class="highlight">female</span> unemployed are concerned, these amounts of money that will be provided under the Bills that we are discussing will do very little, if anything, towards relieving any unemployment that the girls and women find themselves in today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This proposed new section enables the Government to bring about its wage freezing policy, because it provides that the power of the Commission to make an award or to certify an agreement for, or altering, the standard hours of work, minimum wages, <span class="highlight">female</span> rates or annual leave is exercisable only by a full bench, during which proceedings the Commonwealth itself can intervene to put its case for wage freezing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not have the figures at hand, but I do know that the level is considerably higher than it was a few years ago and that it now approaches the levels which have long operated in European and, since long before that, Asian countries where almost entirely predominantly rural occupations are engaged in by both the male and <span class="highlight">female</span> populations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While presenting the House with some caution about the possible disruption to dispensing services available to the public, I think it is also relevant to recall the evidence given before the Select Committee to the effect that enrolments into pharmacy courses have dropped dramatically in recent years and that there also has been a sharp change to <span class="highlight">female</span> rather than male enrolment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The experience of the industry has been that <span class="highlight">female</span> pharmacists do not spend many years actively in the profession and this, together with the likely closure of pharmacies, presents us with a potential problem regarding the future ready availability of dispensing services to the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whyalla consists mostly of a shipbuilding yard, and the Government has done nothing to overcome this problem of <span class="highlight">female</span> employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most importantly, they revealed that child care facilities had not kept pace with the rapid growth in the <span class="highlight">female</span> labour force during the 1960s, and that, as a consequence, existing child care facilities were inadequate, qualitatively and quantitively, for the growing numbers of children needing them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But in the perimeter electorates on the borders of the great cities I believe that as the work grows one <span class="highlight">female</span> secretary is not sufficient to handle all the work involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposed extension of eligibility to unmarried <span class="highlight">female</span> persons who have qualifying service under the Act is designed primarily to benefit single and widowed nurses and exservicewomen without dependants who served overseas with the forces in the 1939-45 War. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The necessary statistical information required to make a precise assessment of the cost of the introduction of 6 weeks maternity leave on full pay for all <span class="highlight">female</span> wage and salary earners is not available, one of the main deficiencies being a lack of data on the number of women who leave the labour force in any one year because of pregnancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In a decision handed down on 15th December, 1972, in the 1972 Equal Pay Cases the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission adopted the principle of ‘equal pay for work of equal value’ for <span class="highlight">female</span> workers employed under its awards and determinations of the Public Service Arbitrator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The precise cost of applying this principle cannot be assessed with any degree of accuracy as it is impossible to predict in advance the value which industrial tribunals will place on work performed by <span class="highlight">female</span> workers who have not been awarded equal pay in accordance with principles laid down by the Commission in its 1969 Equal Pay Cases Decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equal pay will flow to all females (adult and juniors) not already receiving equal pay whose wages and salaries are normally varied in accordance with awards and agreements of industrial tribunals, but not to other <span class="highlight">female</span> employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On average females not already receiving equal pay will receive a pay increase equivalent to the differential that existed immediately prior to the introduction of the total wage between male and <span class="highlight">female</span> basic wage rates and adjusted for subsequent increases to the total wage granted in National Wage Cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the States of New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania (in respect of Crown employees only) have legislation governing the conditions for the granting of equal pay for females employed under their respective State awards, it cannot be assumed that the recent Equal Pay Decision of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission will flow to <span class="highlight">female</span> workers employed under State awards in these States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Minister for Housing  (Mr Les Johnson)  advised the Parliament in his second reading speech the Bill has four main purposes: Firstly, to make provision for the extension of the war service homes scheme to include those members of the forces who have completed a specified period of defence service; secondly, to make provision for an increase in the maximum loan under the scheme from $9,000 to $12,000; thirdly, to make provision for the granting of war service homes benefits to certain unmarried <span class="highlight">female</span> persons with qualifying service under the Act; fourthly, to provide for the extension of eligibility to certain persons who served overseas with the Australian forces in the 1939-45 war, or in war-like operations subsequent to that war, as accredited representatives of a welfare organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a steadily rising figure- It is important because in many areas of contemporary social work it is valuable to have male social workers as well as <span class="highlight">female</span> social workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Low wage rates and multiplicity of classifications for semi-skilled and <span class="highlight">female</span> workers especially in mass production industries, results in a high degree of exploitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government, therefore, is introducing the new benefits and leave entitlements in respect of its own <span class="highlight">female</span> officers and employees - I suppose it is not necessary to say ‘<span class="highlight">female</span>’ officers - to enable each person concerned to fulfil the role of mother and, if she wishes, to continue her career after the birth of her child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the purpose of this Convention, the term woman’ means any <span class="highlight">female</span> person, irrespective of age, nationality, race or creed, whether married or unmarried, and the term ‘child’ means any child whether born of marriage or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This provision is designed to ensure that a maternity protection scheme should not make the employment of females more expensive for the employer than the employment of males, so giving cause for discrimination against <span class="highlight">female</span> labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that even a cursory glance at the available statistics will establish beyond any shadow of a doubt that the overwhelming majority of <span class="highlight">female</span> employees who are married are continuing in employment to do no more than to supplement the family income and so to provide the basic needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Dealing with the period from the June quarter 1 976 to the June quarter 1977 the Commission used the increase in the consumer price index of 13.4 per cent The Commission argued- the honourable member for Gellibrand accepted the proposition and would have the House accept it- that because the consumer price index had increased by 13.4 per cent against respective increases of 10.8 per cent, 10.9 per cent and 1 1.8 per cent in average weekly earnings for adult male minimum wage earners and adult <span class="highlight">female</span> minimum wage earners, there had in fact been a real reduction in wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770824_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is indeed a question which we should all consider carefully and seriously, but the point that I want to make above all other points is that this legislation would not have my support- would not have my vote- if it did anything to restrict the right of the Australian citizen, male or <span class="highlight">female</span>, to follow a particular cause in any corner of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When these figures, which today show a total of 10.4 per cent of the <span class="highlight">female</span> work force unemployed, are added to the hidden unemployment to which I have already referred one can comprehend the problems concerning the newly-structured Commonwealth Employment Service operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The relevant section is section 196 which states that if any officer of customs or of police shall have reasonable cause to suspect that any person is unlawfully carrying, or has any goods subject to the control of customs, or any prohibited imports, or any prohibited exports secreted about him, the following consequences shall ensue: Firstly, the officer may detain and search the suspected person; secondly, before the suspected person shall be searched he may require to be taken before a justice or the Collector of customs; thirdly, the justice or collector may order the suspected person to be searched or may discharge him without search but females shall only be searched by a <span class="highlight">female</span> searcher appointed by the justice or collector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the non-combatant nature of their employment, which is the chief constraint in the wider use of servicewomen, <span class="highlight">female</span> numbers in some categories may be limited to maintain the operational efficiency of the Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-59-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Another factor may have been the different composition of unemployment in this recession; increased job opportunities for women led to a rise in <span class="highlight">female</span> participation rates while the greater relative decline in the manufacturing sector, in particular, led to a rise in the level of male unemployed, the latter being less likely to leave the labour force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The definition of “wife” in Section 18 of the Social Services Act includes a “dependent <span class="highlight">female</span>” so that a woman coming within the definition of a “dependent <span class="highlight">female</span>” is treated, for pension purposes, as if she were the legal wife of the claimant or pensioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-51-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One other fact that concerns me greatly and, I think, should concern this House is the delay in providing pay at equal rates to <span class="highlight">female</span> service personnel who were granted it some eight or nine months ago and have yet to be paid, I understand, because of delays in the Attorney-General’s office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an entitlement that <span class="highlight">female</span> serving officers have and they ought not to be subjected to a delay of the order that has already taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-9">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Last January, <span class="highlight">female</span> members of the armed services were granted equal pay but they still have not been paid and my understanding is that they are not likely to be paid for some considerable time and will be lucky to be paid this financial year moneys which are due to them and on the payment of which decisions have been taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for the delays is that the Attorney-General’s Department has as yet not found time to draft the necessary regulations to provide for the payment of equal pay to those <span class="highlight">female</span> serving officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One such piece of evidence is the fact that despite a far greater percentage increase in <span class="highlight">female</span> wages than in male wages over recent years due to the phasing in of equal pay, <span class="highlight">female</span> employment has fared much better than male employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But in regard to employment, the total number of hours worked per week by all males in civilian employment- that is, the numbers engaged in full or part-time work multiplied by the number of hours worked- actually declined by 2.6 per cent over that period whilst the total number of hours worked by females increased by 8 per cent despite their far greater increase in pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If increases in <span class="highlight">female</span> wage rates are excluded on the assumption that the principle of equal pay for equal work is a social rather than an economic matter, and using a productivity criteria of long-term trend growth in the market sector of the economy with a starting point of 1973, it is even possible to show a 5 per cent wage underhang <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
