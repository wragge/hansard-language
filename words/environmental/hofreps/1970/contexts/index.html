    <p>If so, will he make an early statement on precautions to be taken to prevent, or at least to assess, the costs and benefits of the Jervis Bay reactor plans as compared with alternative power projects including (a) the risks of a major plant accident (however unlikely) and radioactive ore transport leakage pollution, (b) radioactive waste disposal techniques and their long-term effectiveness, (c) <span class="highlight">environmental</span> ecology, (d) the cost factor of safety provisions and (e) the independence of the Atomic Energy Authority from profitability motives or influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is therefore unlikely that the existence of Section 75 (1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act will in itself cause a deterioration in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> diversity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-37-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and particularly to his opinion that this section needs urgent attention of government since much harm to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> diversity and to landscape values could well occur under the blandishment of this provision without any real profit to the community which provides the money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-37-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the many warnings made by responsible conservation authorities that serious detrimental <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences will follow the construction of the proposed Parkes Way extension along the Lake shore and Black Mountain area of Canberra, will he request the National Capital Development Commission to investigate the possibility of bringing forward the construction of the free-way at present being proposed for the eastern side of Canberra so as to relieve the traffic pressure on the western side of Canberra and perhaps make the Parkes Way extension unnecessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would not be possible to compile a complete list of chemical elements and compounds known to be environmentally destructive as many substances are environmentally destructive only if misused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-30-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment to be held in Stockholm in 1972 is considering the establishment of an International Registry of Chemical Compounds as a means towards understanding the effects of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> contaminants on human health and biological systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-30-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Agricultural Council has considered in detail important aspects of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> pollution which have agricultural implications such as pesticides, salinity, soil erosion and soil deterioration and the disposal of ships garbage for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-39-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does this mean that the Commonwealth Parliament’s power with respect to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues remains persuasive only? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Can the right honourable gentleman give an assurance that, if confronted with indifference to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues by those authorities which have the power to deal with them, this Government will display resolution on the matter even to the point of being accused of centralism? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What were the names and portfolios of the Ministers with responsibility for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters who met in Perth on 3rd December 1971 (Hansard, 6th October 1971, page 2003). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1), (2) and (3) Apart from the actual provision of health services, the social and economic aspects of health care encompass a wide range of matters such as health education, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> health and social conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will he use the resources of his office to ensure that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> desecration is at least minimised even at this late stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-21-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question would be more appropriately addressed to the State Minister for <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-21-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has Australia taken steps to develop bilateral relations on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters with the United States of America as Canada, Japan, Mexico, Spain, France, Germany, Poland, Yugoslavia and India have done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-21-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where and when have there been meetings of Commonwealth and State Ministers with responsibility for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters since 17th September 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the Commonwealth is concerned, the question is ons of devising a pattern of national development in which <span class="highlight">environmental</span> objectives go hand in hand with economic, cultural and social goals; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, what did he mean in this statement on 24th May 1972 that the Commonwealth is concerned with devising a pattern of national development in which <span class="highlight">environmental</span> objectives go hand in hand with economic goals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of Australia’s involvement in  a  proposed international convention on the dumping of industrial wastes at sea has been the subject of correspondence between the Prime Minister and the Premiers commencing in July 1971 as well as discussions between Commonwealth and State Ministers responsible for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> control and also the Ministers responsible for port development and marine affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-36-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a statement issued after a meeting of the Australian Environment Council in Canberra on 27th July 1972 Ministers attached particular importance to the adoption of actions and procedures to check on dumping in the oceans off Australia and the implementation of adequate controls to prevent <span class="highlight">environmental</span> damage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-36-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council also directed its Standing Committee to examine urgently the final draft international convention on ocean dumping, expected to be concluded by next November, and to report on the implications for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> control in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-36-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by looking into the desirable level of the Australian population; establishing co-ordination of Commonwealth and State activities in the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> field; and taking part in international activities such as the recent Stockholm Conference on the Environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Reid  (Mr Uren)  mentioned <span class="highlight">environmental</span> difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said yesterday that I believed that the substance of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> statements should be made available and published. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to a question from the honourable member for Reid on 23rd August did the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts reject the principle of making <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements public on the grounds that these reports were for Government information only? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Prime Minister now accepted the principle of disclosing these reports as essential documents for informed public debate on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the position is as stated, will the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of the scheme based on Lake Pedder be considerably altered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-19-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an interim measure the principles developed by the previous Government be adopted immediately and extended in accordance with the next recommendation; in addition, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements be required at the Minister’s discretion after consultation with appropriate Ministers, where a proposal has significant <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences and where Commonwealth funds are involved and/or where Commonwealth constitutional power is involved; as from 1st January 1974 the provisions of this paragraph to become mandatory without any discretion at all and the proposing Department or Authority be required to arrange, through the Department of the Environment and Conservation, for public hearings in the case of all impact statements involving the Commonwealth in order to ensure that the public is given an opportunity to express its views on the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact of a proposal prior to the particular impact statement being prepared; the Department of the Environment and Conservation in consultation with other interested Departments to be directed to prepare draft guidelines for the requirements for and preparation of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements and to advise on the need for and, if appropriate, the form of covering legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-8">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now clear that the significant delay to the Pipeline Authority is not any <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry in New South Wales but the proceedings of the honourable member’s Party - that section of it - in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Similarly these departments largely determine the completion dates for <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Impact Statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-41-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A proposal for the establishment of a Bureau of <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Studies is at present under consideration by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-57-3">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The information requested by the honourable member is quite extensive as the all-embracing nature of the term ‘environment programs’ means that nearly all international organisations are involved in some <span class="highlight">environmental</span> programs and Australia has been active in many of these. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am pleased to see that the honourable member is keeping abreast of the Labor Party’s <span class="highlight">environmental</span> platform which was adopted at our recent conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-35-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Part of that preliminary work has been a study which was undertaken by a firm of consultants to ascertain the sources of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> data available in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am unsure of what the honourable member means by ‘formal procedures’ but impact statements are required where a proposal has significant <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences and Australian Government funds and/or constitutional power is involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just briefly let me say that the Department of Environment and Conservation has laid down guidelines for all Departments for the preparation of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that Department at any time can seek a public hearing on an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement, as was the case with the report on the Molonglo Parkway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement which the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  was good enough to show me earlier has been prepared by the National Capital Development Commission and the Department of Housing and Construction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Environmental</span> studies are an integral part of Transport planning, and therefore <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters affect the duties of a number of transport planners and transport analysts in the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads to an effect which is considered the equivalent of approximately two full time positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The function of Bureau staff members concerned with <span class="highlight">environmental</span> studies is to conduct investigations into <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects of roads in order to ensure that the Bureau is fully informed of these matters for the purpose of its responsibilities under its Act <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will no doubt encompass research being undertaken in the United States on the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects of Concorde nights and until this has been assessed and until the Australian community has had a chance to see the document and to comment on it, the Australian Government will make no decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 based my assessment of this proposal on the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement prepared by the Forests Department of Western Australia and on answers to supplementary questions which I asked the W.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the circumstances, having regard to the fact that no <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement procedures had been finalised at the time this matter was considered by the Government and having regard to the fact that the Government had decided not to insist on public comment on impact statements prior to January 1974, 1 was prepared to accept the Western Australian approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-36-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am satisfied that the major areas of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> concern were identified prior to any Australian Government decision being made, but it was recognised at the time that many of the details associated with the proposal, such as potential salinity effects and the adequacy of reserves of representative ecosystems, could only be determined by research and monitoring programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-36-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to see the Opposition, in the form of the honourable member for Reid  (Mr Uren),  putting forward a definite matter of public importance dealing with <span class="highlight">environmental</span> pollution because it illustrates once again the Labor Party’s notorious capacity for jumping onto whatever the current political bandwagon happens to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It costs a heap of money to reduce <span class="highlight">environmental</span> pollution and these costs must be met by somebody and they must be met out of the taxpayers’ pockets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition today seeks to suggest that the Government is unaware of the problems of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be very easy to over-react to questions concerned with <span class="highlight">environmental</span> disturbance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the point of the whole thing is that we are all, on both sides of the House and in all Parties, agreed that the problems of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> pollution are great ones which are  worthy  of deep and close attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a danger that over-reaction could take place and I think that any responsible Government should do as this one has done, investigate the problem, realise that it is part of a total overall <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problem, and act accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet more and more people are beginning to see economic growth itself as the basic cause of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> deterioration which has become one of the nation’s most pressing problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Environmental</span> problems arc complex and their solution calls for programmes of research, planning, education, legislation, the fixing of standards which require enforcement, and of course public information so that the general public will be informed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the defence aspects of the issue there are <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects which are important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the words ‘unless the Government is able to convince the Parliament that the work is urgent’ are very interpretative and they apply not only to the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> situation but could well apply to the strategic situation as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I make as I read these several comments of the Prime Minister is that the commitment is being made and subsequently in its wake after the commitment, which must be upheld at all costs, comes the consideration of the ecology of Cockburn Sound, the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has led to the thought that the Commonwealth should establish a Cockburn Sound commission to assume overall responsibility for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> management of Cockburn Sound. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the suggestion for the establishment of a Cockburn Sound commission to take over the responsibility of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> management of Cockburn Sound is worth while and should be adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I quote from an article written by him on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> surveys in relation to the natural environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With this in mind, it can be seen that before any <span class="highlight">environmental</span> modification can take place there must be a survey or stock-take nf the environment to see: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the feasibility study was based on a causeway with a single opening, and that a second opening of larger cross section is now found advantageous, suggests that feasibility of the causeway as a concept was assessed on engineering and narrow economic criteria, with little regard for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such considerations have certainly influenced the final design, but there is some reason for believing that the design changes anti-date the availability of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> data. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view Of the fact that our agricultural and urban-industrial scene has now reached the stage where scientific research without regard to ecological side effects and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences is no longer defeasible, scientifically or ethically, will the Minister state what steps have been taken to re-align or alter the research priorities of the CSIRO in the light of the Chairman’s statement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710309_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth can certainly give financial assistance, but it is not as necessary to have Commonwealth financial assistance for the States to provide adequate law enforcement and research services as it is for the Commonwealth to give adequate financial assistance to enable the States to play their part in providing adequate educational, health and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such pollution is not the inevitable by-product of advanced technology and population increase, but it does represent a failure to take fully into account the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences of our actions, and of the disposal of waste products by individuals and factories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth has power to levy taxes, lt could strive for uniformity by levying taxes in accordance with the legislation - for example, special taxes on pollution, tax incentives to encourage pollution control and, if necessary, a tax surcharge to encourage pollution control and to give grants to the Stales, local and semigovernmental authorities to ensure a system of policing the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both this Government and the Askin Government in New South Wales stand indicted in respect of both Jervis Bay and the Clutha deal, because both projects were a fait accompli before either Parliaments or the public had any chance to question, to challenge or to evaluate the issues in terms of cost and in respect of economic, social or <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are there any objections which prevent the Commonwealth  (a)  from passing legislation on  a  wide variety of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues in Commonwealth territories which legislation would serve as  a  model for the States and (b) from levying pollution taxes in the States as well as in Commonwealth territories based on emission levels and using the tax collections to provide grants to the States to help them measure and police their pollution laws? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-30-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the decision to postpone the establishment of the Office of the Environment indicate that in the Government’s view the Commonwealth need not play a leading and co-ordinating role in the development of  a  rational <span class="highlight">environmental</span> policy or that the role is unimportant? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-30-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These works are referred because of the lapse of time since sewerage schemes for Darwin, covering the northern and central zones, were referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in March 1969, and because of the concern of members of the Darwin community that a satisfactory standard of treatment should be achieved having regard to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time as manufacturing profitability is falling, profitability in nonmanufacturing industry seems to be rising, and this trend is likely to continue because many of our manufacturing industries face heavy costs for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> control measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Once legislation has been passed by the Commonwealth and by all States, a joint Commonwealth and State authority should administer pollution and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>High land prices, overcrowding, transport and traffic difficulties, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> disturbance and pollution, psychological problems leading to high crime rates, the rising costs of the provision of public facilities and the absence of recreational facilities are just some of the factors which combine to reduce the quality of life in many big cities of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Engineering feasibility and order of cost of alternative plans, some 16 in all, at all these locations were considered, as well as the compatibility of such airports with the adjacent communities, access by surface transport, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite apart from the aspects I have mentioned, the very important interests of local communities, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors and the very great cost involved in a second airport for Sydney, require that this project must be most carefully considered and all available viewpoints brought to bear upon it before any decisions are taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In considering the alternatives, the committee is to take into account all the relevant factors, including operational, technical, financial and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations, capacity and accessibility by surface transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that by so doing we will be setting an example in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters of this nature because I am certain that in the months to come these conflicts of interest between conservation and economic development interests will be of growing importance to the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The inner city schools, almost by definition, by lack of education basically in that particular community, by lack of income, and as a result of that by the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> deficiencies that have accrued, have provided less for themselves than some other schools but to me it is negative thinking to say that those people who will or can help themselves should not be helped any further because there are others who are less capable of helping themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it any wonder that the Government never develops any co-ordinated <span class="highlight">environmental</span> policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Environmental</span> policy by this Government has grown piecemeal, with never a thought as to whether a total overview of the situation is required, and a restructure of administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can divide <span class="highlight">environmental</span> administration into  2  areas - policy making and problem solving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem solvers will need complete data bank facilities and specialists and will receive <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements for all activities which will have any <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Population policy, including immigration; natural resource policy, including exports of natural resources; science policy, including research policy; technology policy, including pollution control; educational policy and urban policy will all be influenced by the comprehensive <span class="highlight">environmental</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The United States of America, for example, has a problemsolving agency - the Council on Environ-, mental Quality - and a policy making agency - the <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not only because the problem is in large measure an economic one, but also because <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems recognise no State boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Watching television tonight, I was pleased to note that the New South Wales Government has set up at Lidcombe an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> control office with a staff of 36. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They exchanged information on existing legislation and gave their views on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is the only way in which we will get anywhere with <span class="highlight">environmental</span> control in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is dealing with the protection and restoration of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> quality and industry’s role in this immense task. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, unhappily, even though a larger population could well live there, the ‘frontier philosophy’ is even more rampant in Australia than in the United States in terms of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> deterioration and agricultural overexploitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 believe 1 have said enough to indicate that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> hazards can and do transcend international boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was recommended that international treaties should be examined to ascertain their impact on the environment and that parliaments of the world should be advised of the potential <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects of those treaties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was recommended also that the United Nations Organisation should sponsor international <span class="highlight">environmental</span> programmes and that an international pollution data bank should be established and that the function of this bank should be to collect information and to make it available to all countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was pointed out by the Prime Minister yesterday when he was replying to a question from the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  that, in addition to using powers of persuasion, the Commonwealth could act on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters by advancing certain funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within the last 20 to 25 years the progress in industry and communications and the increase in the number of city dwellers have created a situation in which man has to take a quick, serious look at the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems which he has created and is still creating and which have certainly been to bis own detriment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great majority of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems stem from the population growth of industrial societies around the world and the impact which they have made on both physical and social environments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While public and political awareness of the issues of urbanism, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> control and the preservation of the quality of life in cities or, for that matter, in the countryside is highly desirable, it is undesirable to make a direct transfer of European or United States experiences and problems to the Australian  scene without modification or qualification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, I believe that a case has been fully established for an examination of this important area of environment, for the simple reason that the greatest number of people in this country will be affected by <span class="highlight">environmental</span> changes in that particular area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that I should dwell for a short time on the role as I see it of the Commonwealth in our <span class="highlight">environmental</span> affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had an opportunity to study the way in which Federal and State systems relating to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters have been adopted in places throughout the world, but I have not studied it in great depth because the time has not been available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wherever there is a federal system there has to be a policy department of the environment and these have to be administrative departments that carry out individual <span class="highlight">environmental</span> procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have indicated to the House before and as the honourable member for Reid mentioned, there are seven or eight Commonwealth departments that administer various facets of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I believe that in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters the role of the Commonwealth - exclusively; of its own responsibility - should be firstly to set an example within its own territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it should see that the administrative departments carry out the task and realise how important <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters are at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What action has been taken by the Government to implement the resolution of the International Parliamentary Conference on the Environment that governments should begin international negotiations on pollution control, research and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of treaties and foreign aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that the Commonwealth is getting its own involvement in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters through the setting up of a Department, does your Department feel obliged to look at the possible effects on the ecology of dumping this material into the sea? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be a definite improvement of the scenic and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of South Head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I can see also considerable merit in making an examination of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects that were mentioned by the honourable member, and I will discuss this matter with the CSIRO to see what further information I can get for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>know, because of the wide range of soil types, climatic conditions and particular <span class="highlight">environmental</span> circumstances there is a demand for special fertiliser elements in particular areas in particular types of land use management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been no research into the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors, particularly in Botany Bay, but anywhere else either on a national basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I find it incomprehensible that the mistakes so evident at Mascot will be repeated by placing an international 24-hour airport in this housing development area ignoring the noise and other <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the United States, I had lengthy and very frank discussions with  President  Nixon, Secretary of State Rogers, Defence Secretary Laird,  Deputy  Secretary Packard,  Dr Kissinger,  Under Secretary of the Treasury Volcker,  Chairman  of the Council of <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Quality Russell Train, and  Senator Fulbright, Chairman  of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From these discussions I gained valuable insights into American experience of the problems of dealing with pollution and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection measures, especially in the context of a federal-state relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Additionally, because it has enacted virtually no legislation to cover its own territories, the Government obviously feels that citizens living in these territories have no <span class="highlight">environmental</span> rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a world where everything is connected to everything else, it can be very misleading to isolate ‘basic <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In reporting favourably on the proposal the Committee recommended: If tests and evaluations justify the use of carpets as an economic floor covering and if there is no doubt about its suitability, it should be used in single cabins at HMAS ‘Stirling; service scales and standards of accommodation should be amended to provide carpet as a floor covering in single cabins; the advice of experts on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems should continue to be sought and implemented during development and occupation of the naval support facility; because of the widespread nature of community interest, day to day care and management of areas of Garden Island open to the public should be a State responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some of the important reasons why this question has to be tackled with competence and foresight in Australia are as follows: Firstly, the country is large and any energy resources are unevenly distributed geographically; secondly, primary energy consumption is increasing at an annual rate of 6 per cent compared with about 3 per cent for the rest of the world; thirdly, electricity consumption is increasing at the rate of about 9.S per cent per annum compared with 5 or 6 per cent for the rest of the world; fourthly, a high rate of industrialisation and development is taking place in Australia; fifthly, a major exporter of energy resources needs to review periodically its resources and pattern of use to ensure that adequate reserves are retained for domestic use; sixthly, State fuel resources and energy consumption can no longer be considered in isolation - for example, natural gas and proposed interstate transmission lines; seventhly, the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and pollution aspects of fuel and energy production and utilisation are becoming of much greater concern to governments and communities; and eighthly, economic benefits may accrue to the nation by control of energy usage patterns - for example, incentives to reduce heavy fuel oil imports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that on 24th May this year the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  stated that, when Commonwealth Government money was involved in anything that could have an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact, an impact statement would be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A power station is to be built at Tennant Creek and a power station, whether it is small or large, can have an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the power station is to be built in the township, I would like to know the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact it will have on this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He asked: What aspects of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact had the government studied before making its decision? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to suggest that the Ministry for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts - this Ministry which is very ambiguous in many respects and which from the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> standpoint hardly seems to have come down to any positive line of objectivity - should start to accept some responsibility in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without disputing this contention by the Minister I feel he should have put greater stress on the peculiar <span class="highlight">environmental</span> conditions of the rural islands off Australia’s coast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Each of the 3 large islands which are important rural producers and are farmed largely by soldier settlers is confronted by a unique set of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I stress that I support this sort of assistance; I hope that similar comprehensive programmes of assistance will be worked out for other regions which may suffer from the incidence of a harmful combination of economic and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the Senate’s amendment be disagreed to, but that in place thereof the following amendment be made: ‘In the Schedule, at the end of clause 9, add “and shall ensure that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors relating to the planting have been considered”.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The absence of reference to the ‘environment’ in the originally proposed agreement does not mean that this important field has been ignored; in fact <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of forestry activities are very much in mind in the formulation of forestry programmes throughout Australia and the very expression ‘sound forestry . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The conference will recognise the importance, not only of economic matters concerning forests and forest industries, but also social and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of forestry and forest industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment that I have proposed to clause 9 of the Agreement will ensure that planting is carried out each year efficiently and in conformity with sound forestry and financial practices and that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors are considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors relating to planting are considered; in other words, that the States when carrying out reafforestation programmes will fully take into account <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is clear that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors have to be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the clearing of timber regard must be had to ecological and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> influences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Planting methods demand that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors be taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there are good reasons to consider the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects, although I am not as keen or dedicated a conservationist as my friend the honourable member for Reid  (Mr Uren). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because I am at heart a developer, it does not mean that T do not take into account or am not conscious of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the proof of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors not being fully considered in the burning of pastures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in all States they are fully conscious of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors but it does not hurt to give them a nudge or two occasionally to let them know that this Parliament is now taking a great interest in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors in re-afforestation programmes which are so important to this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other significant issue involved in all this, of course, is the developing consciousness about <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters in Australia, and it is good to know that in that extreme northern part there is no less sensitivity about such an issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The State shall ensure that natural forests shall not be cleared for planting softwoods unless the particular proposed clearing has beforehand been the subject of an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study made by an independent expert on behalf of the Australian Forestry Council and that Council after considering the report of the said study has approved the particular clearing.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, they would probably be the leaders in the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But no matter how progressive the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> people are they have to be open to criticism and there have been mistakes made by the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instructions were given that, particularly when there was likely to be an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> or pollution effect, a statement had to be attached to each one of the Cabinet submissions setting out the nature of the effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 24th May last, speaking on behalf of the Government, the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  who is now sitting on the front bench, made a statement that all Federal action would require an ‘<span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most far-reaching may well be the growing public interest in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> quality, which may lead to the rejection of the motor car as the universal symbol of individual freedom and the adoption of less time-wasting relationships between home and work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another factor which will emerge in my judgment is that, although heavy initial investment in new centres will be required, in the longer term this will prove to be more a re-deployment of funds rather than the provision of huge additional expenditures, because undoubtedly the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and pollution problems and the transport and traffic problems of the growing metropolitan complexes are in themselves providing a tremendous bill to the people - the taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements will be for Cabinet and bureaucratic eyes only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister in a reply to a question by the Leader of the Opposition in this House on Tuesday last said that in his opinion the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement should be made public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final impact statement sent to the Council on <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Quality must include all the public comments on the statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The constitutional power Includes the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection of Commonwealth territory, the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact of interstate or international trade particularly the export of natural resources, the regulation of corporations now that quite a few issues have been cleared up by the High Court in the so called concrete pipes case, and certain other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In areas of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact assessment which do not require Federal money or power and over which the Commonwealth has no jurisdiction the Commonwealth will act to work with the States for rational management and the protection of the Australian environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here in Australia we have many big <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>number among them the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspect of our life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that most of what is happening in the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> sense is to be found in these estimates under the heading ‘Administrative’ which accounts for more than half of the total of over $40m to be appropriated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Considering that the Conservation Foundation and various branches of that body are likely at any stage to be quite significant critics of any government which cannot be seen to be doing enough in the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> sense, I think this is a significant contribution and it is  a  significant indication of the Government’s intentions in the field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the biggest problems that confronts this or any other government in doing something meaningful in the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> area is to work with all the powers that be in the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose it is fair to say now that the much criticised, in some ways, impact statements are in fact a very considerable move in the direction of a national framework for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> awareness and action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think people are aware that impact statements are designed to show what any given intended action may produce in the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> sense, in particular what detrimental effects or what changes in the environment may be brought about by any direction of action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have to do, what the Minister has to do and what his Department has to do is to get into some reasonable sense of balance the kind of things we need to be done in the future in the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this is where <span class="highlight">environmental</span> action and policy are beginning in our Commonwealth Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The debate which we have only just concluded, relating to urban and regional development, dealt with land use which is one of the most basic facets of this whole <span class="highlight">environmental</span> business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But in Kiryu, Japan, this would not be allowed to happen because this matter is the subject of an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> or impact study. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the time allowed to me 1 wish to concentrate on the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of the estimates that are now before the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1971 an <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection Authority was set up in Victoria and the pamphlet publicising the setting up of this authority is headed ‘Tomorrow and tomorrow and . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must think of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of industry and other things in a total concept of national planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As  President  Nixon said in his 1972 <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Message to Congress: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The starting point of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> quality is in the hearts and minds of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree completely with this statement and have a strong belief that we must more strenuously assess our laws, our developmental projects, our manufacturing systems and methods, and our use of scarce resources to minimise adverse <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past we have emphasised quantitative growth at the expense of qualitative growth; the failure to attempt to assess <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects when undertaking new developments; neglecting to account for the social costs of pollution; the increasing dependence on conveniences such as the car without due regard for the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measures aimed at <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection are not necessarily divinely inspired and it could be that in some cases the cure is or could be worse than the complaint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, in any consideration of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects there are some very hard questions to answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> clean-up and maintenance will have to be borne by each person whether as a consumer or a taxpayer and most probably as both, and the cost will not be cheap. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this leads to my second warning, and this ls specifically directed at those who see the cause of our problems as being the growth economy and the onward march of science and technology and who advocate as a cure the restriction or abolition of our dependence on technology, the cutting bask of an economy based on growth and the introduction of extremely harsh <span class="highlight">environmental</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, as I have said already, the economy and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> action are irretrievably intertwined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not to do so is to invite the slowing down or stopping of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> action as a result of the backlash I have referred to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Punitive laws have to be enforced if they are to have any effect, and in an area as widespread as <span class="highlight">environmental</span> control the sheer size of the law enforcing agency necessary is frightening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, however, both companies and individuals secured worthwhile rewards - and this would almost automatically have to be economic - for acceptable <span class="highlight">environmental</span> actions, the chances of widespread co-operation would be greater. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most important of these problems is the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the under-developed nations <span class="highlight">environmental</span> stress becomes evident earlier and shows itself in the more traditional manner through starvation and disease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A common symptom of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> breakdown is the use of irrigation for food production, leading to increased salinity levels and the ultimate failure of crops. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The efforts of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation should be considerably expanded in the field of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> conservation and the Organisation should immediately undertake the national survey of natural resources which was suggested by the National Academy of Science in 1968 and again in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was suggested by that conference that much more research should be conducted into projects having <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact and that individual countries should consider adopting methods in favour of antipollutant goods and services and against certain goods and services which contribute to pollution and that these be of a fiscal nature and involve tax concessions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Vienna Conference concluded that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> education at all levels is essential to the wellbeing of the planet in which we live and for man’s place in the planet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It recommended that all governments support an education and information programme both in regard to policy and money and that every parliament establish a special committee which is competent to deal with <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though the Government has emerged so belatedly, in this pre-election period, with concern about Aboriginal welfare, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters and many other things, it will help to compound the efforts that have been made by the Australian Labor Party to make these real issues for the whole country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is staggering to think that the Commonwealth Government, which now has a Minister responsible for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> affairs, has been a party to putting to the Parliament proposals that would have a deleterious effect on the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of that is to ensure that in respect of every developmental proposal a study will be made from an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> standpoint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some members of the Committee were tempted to knock that proposal back also, because it cannot be accounted for in terms of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Too strict controls on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and ecological matters will create vast problems for governments and private industry in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The various piecemeal activities of several government departments must be lumped together so that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> policy reflects the environment itself - a whole and integrated system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States of America, for example, has a problem solving agency - the Council of <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Quality - and a policy making agency - the <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many countries have tried to set up huge monolithic departments with the power to solve <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems, lt is a hopeless and futile path to take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition really has no clear conception as to how <span class="highlight">environmental</span> machinery should be established in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both stressed the need for balance in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations and said that we must balance the needs of the environment against the needs of the economy and try to see that the two march hand in hand together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very early in its term of office the Western Australian Government established an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection authority, and the Government has consistently acted on the basis of its recommendations even where, as in the postponement of the Pacminex refinery project, they were in conflict with other basic Government aims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-But in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters, as in all areas where costs are heavy, we will not get anywhere without Commonwealth involvement and commitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all areas of development the Government is giving special attention to the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A major <span class="highlight">environmental</span> fact-finding study of the Alligator River area is now under way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government’s aim is to achieve a balance between all the relevant factors, and it is paying careful attention to social and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was any impact study made from an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> standpoint? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to the prominence of Black Mountain and the importance of preserving its natural state as far as is possible, the Government has given very careful consideration to the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> question and has fully considered all of the representations which have been made on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I express my concern firstly because I do not think I can see attached to the report of the Public Works Committee an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 24th May of this year he made a statement that where Commonwealth moneys were involved <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements would be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under questioning from me about whether or not the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements would be made public the Minister stated quite coldly that they would not be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following this matter up the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam),  in a question to the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  which appears on page 1972 of Hansard of 27th September, asked about the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware that a Public Works Committee inquiry was held into the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspect but I would like to know, with due respect to my colleagues on my side of the House who are members of the Committee and also to supporters of the Government who are members, what qualified environmentalist was on the Committee to give advice on the scientific evidence and to make his findings available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to have <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements we want to see trained scientists in the field of ecology and the environment deal with these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time that he got on his feet and told us what he thought about <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements was made in this place even though we made available the bridging finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will take a while to get it moving but we hope that in regard to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects we will make available all the arguments, we will make public any documents which are available and we will make our decisions known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee heard detailed evidence from the environmentalists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They weighed up the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems and they weighed up the recommendations of the National Capital Development Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are also told that the proposal has been sensibly approached from the standpoint of all the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors that are highlighted in discussions these days in that the power station is being put behind a number of hills south-west of the town and some distance away from the town in a position where the wind will blow the fumes away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the honourable member for Reid  (Mr Uren)  at least will be gratified to know that this project has a clean bill of health and there do not seem to be any <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems about the Tennant Creek power station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problem about the Tennant Creek school either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So given that there were no greater <span class="highlight">environmental</span> difficulties, or difficulties of distance or of administration, other things being equal, even for their own hospital scheme Queensland could have gained a favourable adjustment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister now institute feasibility studies of the application of the H-coal process, utilising the vast brown coal resources in the Latrobe Valley of Victoria, in the production of oil from coal on the grounds of national security, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection and decentralisation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that following the election results we will have a. representative for Macarthur who will be continuously assiduous in his representations for the needs of decent developmental and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> standards for the people of Canberra, for the people of Campbelltown and, indeed, for the people of the Commonwealth of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Otherwise we would see in the brief of the authority or as components of the Government’s regional development planning essential policies in respect of population, development and conservation of our natural resources, industrial growth, tariffs, rationalisation of transport in Australia and the use of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact assessments as a tool of national planning and government decision making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All that the authorities will be able to do is to design the locations on the ground and ensure that, by design, these cities are livable ones of the highest <span class="highlight">environmental</span> quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the proposed takeover is judged to be not against the national interest on this basis, the following additional criteria will also be taken into account: Whether, after the takeover, the firm concerned could be expected to follow practices consistent with Australia’s interest in matters such as exports, imports, local processing of materials produced, research and development, and industrial relations, including employee protection; and whether the takeover would have adverse effects on the Government’s defence objectives, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection or regional development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In so doing the programme should identify and attempt to rationalise <span class="highlight">environmental</span> research activities being undertaken in various localities and instrumentalities and not seek to duplicate work already being . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-49-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He seemed to include in it about 4 kinds of national interest, some of which seem to be major, some of which seem to be comparatively minor and many of which seem to be merely afterthoughts to pay deference to such things as regional development, defence strategy and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It must be considered whether the takeovers would have adverse effects on Australia’s defence, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection and regional development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second part of the amendment refers to the Government’s failure to act in a comprehensive way to ensure that Australian territorial waters are protected from all <span class="highlight">environmental</span> threats from oil, whether they be from shipping or land based activities, including all ocean dumping. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I come to paragraph (b) of the amendment, which states that the Government - I suppose it means the Commonwealth Government - ‘has not acted in a comprehensive way to ensure that Australian territorial waters are protected from all <span class="highlight">environmental</span> threats from oil, whether they be from shipping or land based activities and including all ocean dumping’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to other aspects of the inquiry, the Committee has made a great number of recommendations which it believes will, in combination, have a profound beneficial effect on wildlife conservation and hopefully on other aspects of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During its inquiry the Committee became: aware of the very great concern of a large number of individuals about a wide range of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and conservation matters, many of them outside the scope of this Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I think a great deal of emphasis should be placed on the Committee’s recommendation that a standing committee of the House of Representatives should be established in the new Parliament to inquire into matters of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and conservation concern referred to it by the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Committee also recommended that the land usage patterns in the vicinity of the airport should be controlled so that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems associated with the airport development and use do not arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In recommending that construction proceed, the Committee also recommended that land usage patterns in the vicinity of the airport be controlled so that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems associated with the airport development and use do not arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We hope this is all in the past and that the Government has at last awakened to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems and the problems of development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The study will be most comprehensive and take into account not only a comparison of the costs of all works involved in these proposals but also a comparison of the benefits and costs in all significant aspects including <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors and aircraft noise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-71-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We can define 3 areas of responsibility relating to the problem of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>me in this debate I should, like to discuss something which relates particularly tq , my own portfolio, namely, the .<span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement technique which we have proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I concede quite frankly that the previous Government had adopted the concept of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements designed to protect the environment; but its proposals had not in fact reached the implementation stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my electorate of La Trobe there lie 2 gems in the Victorian <span class="highlight">environmental</span> crown - the Upper Yarra Valley and the Dandenong Ranges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These national parks will become more important as increased leisure unlocks the opportunities to enjoy our <span class="highlight">environmental</span> heritage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But 1 feel the Government will need to demand <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements for all major commercial and private projects as well as Government projects if the total objective is to be realised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our success will lie in removing the increasing internal and industrial disturbances and in halting the over-development of urbanism and its associated <span class="highlight">environmental</span> ills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, if personal consumption is not to be reduced - and this the Government has said it will not do - the only way we can afford increased expenditure on education, social services, health, care of the aged, housing and urban renewal, improved transport and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> control is through increased productivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the increased public interest in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations, it is pertinent to note that timber sleepers are produced from a naturally replenished source of organic material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this respect, I wish to quote from the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Environment which inquired into the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> conditions of Aborigines and Torres Strait islanders and the preservation of their sacred sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>fs this not an excellent site by reason of its remote situation and the fact that it is a sandstone scrub area which, from an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> point of view, is first class? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement prepared by the South Australian Government is also provided for the information of honourable members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will be able to ensure the widest use of the natural resources present and would be accountable for the presentation of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements on the departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that the authorities will be able to do is to design the locations on the ground and ensure that by design, these cities are livable ones of the highest <span class="highlight">environmental</span> quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what the concept of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements is about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This work has now virtually been completed and from what I have learnt of it I am confident that this study will present an excellent appraisal of all the significant issues involved in the siting of a new airport, including <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential, therefore, that the benefit-cost study has sufficient freedom to produce ultimately a selection of the best site having regard, on the one hand, to the community’s need for efficient air transport services, and on the other, to its desire to avoid unnecessary economic or <span class="highlight">environmental</span> penalties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, neither the Commonwealth-State committee nor the consultants are going to recommend the continuation for another 12 months of a benefit-cost study in respect of any site which has obvious overwhelming economic, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> or social disadvantages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that careful benefit-cost and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> studies will show that some or ali of these sites are not the most suitable for Sydney’s second airport but it is clear that the decisions of the Liberal governments were uninformed and were vain attempts to preserve its electoral chances rather than responsible decisions of governments dedicated to decision making in the interests of the community as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> study was being undertaken, that it was completed this week, and that the Commonwealth Government was awaiting the result of that study. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The use of a Standing Committee rather than a series of select committees should facilitate the timely consideration of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues as they arise, thereby strengthening Parliament’s role in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In moving for the establishment of this Committee I am conscious of the great many <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems that must be both faced and solved if the future citizens of this country are to enjoy the kind of life that so many of us take for granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The attempt by the honourable member to make political capital out of an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issue, which is of concern to many Australians and which the previous Government, of which he was a member, chose to ignore, will be recognised by conservationists throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My attention has been drawn to a speech by  Mr Uren  as the then Opposition spokesman on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters in the Hobart Town Hall on 7th November in which he said inter alia: ‘I would like a combined FederalState review to take place, including the Tasmanian Government, the Hydro-electric Commission, conservation groups, and all sorts of experts from the Federal level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It had become abundantly clear in this, the most urbanised society in the world, with the growing congestion of traffic and people in our major capital cities and with all the associated social and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems of pollution - air, water and noise - with its depressing effect on the human mentality and, I think, with its influence on the increasing crime rate amongst our young people, that the States needed the co-operation and the involvement of the Australian Government to change this trend of growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quite frankly any different behaviour on the part of someone who speaks so feelingly about <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and conservation matters, as does the Minister, would be difficult to countenance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That member will be experienced in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I presume that what he meant was that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors were <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors and must be tackled in every way as a whole in that connection and not be regarded as separate matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>will realise that they have <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors different from those in any of the other areas that he might have in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only should environmentalists who live in Double Bay but also people who have some understanding of what is going on in, say, the outer western suburbs of Sydney and of the needs in that area should be on this Advisory Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In opposition to the proposition that was implied by the right honourable member for Higgins  (Mr Gorton)  I would argue that on this Commission there should be a significant number of people who do not have as one of their background qualifications membership of the National Trust of Australia or some conservation society or <span class="highlight">environmental</span> group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that was done, if nothing else, at least we would have a balance of opinion between those  people  on the Advisory Committee or the Commission who belong to the National Trust and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> groups, who have very definite points of view, and people with different points of view and different priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all are well aware of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and social problems that have to be tackled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This event - an event which is becoming common these days in our cities - is symbolic of the decline in the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> quality of the major cities of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a narrowminded State authority with a brief to build roads only and not to consider any aspects of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> or social impact of the development of roads. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently the Council was influenced by fear of losing Department of Main Roads funds to some other city or municipality in New South Wales, thus it acted in haste after recommending the previous week to let the matter stand over for 4 months pending conferences between the New South Wales <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> and Local Government Departments and various conservation groups, the New South Wales Department of Main Roads, the Newcastle City Council and residents likely to be affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government must give the lead here to get good planning from bureaucracies, such as the Department of Main Roads, by the provision of adequate <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements; to ensure that the State Government of New South Wales does likewise; and by giving more money to the States under section 96 of the Constitution rather than by general loan funds to ensure that environmentally and socially equitable and sensible transport systems are developed in our cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know that in recent weeks organisations interested in protecting the environment have contacted the Minister for the Environment and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  regarding the need for a proper <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study to be made of the proposed motorway through Blackbutt Reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In recognising the need to decentralise, I believe we all agree that we need to take into consideration the available recreational, vocational and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> amenities in close proximity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These proposed international monitoring programs will be further discussed by the United Nations Governing Council on <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Programs and the question of Australia’s participation in them is under investigation by  the  relevant agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that the Fine Rivers Shire, the Caboolture Shire and Redcliffe City are rapidly developing residential areas, will he refer the proposed site to the appropriate Department for an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and planning report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-40-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee also recommended that guidelines for preparation of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements be laid down as soon as possible and that the planning arrangements of the Post Office be examined with the aim of effecting changes in policy or overcoming shortcomings in procedures and resources to avoid late referrals of proposals in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An interdepartmental committee is examining the policy directives necessary to lay down guidelines for the preparation of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements and has set up 3 working parties to assist in its determinations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interdepartmental committee has a target of recommending to the Government guidelines for preparation and presentation of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements in time for amendments of legislation as necessary to be processed during the Budget session of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman will recall that the Minister for Minerals and Energy issued a statement on Tuesday in which he blamed the reason for any delay in the delivery of Gidgealpa gas to Sydney entirely on the New South Wales <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this not mean that the Minister was not correct when he claimed that only the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry was delaying this project? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have in mind the number of farms to be serviced and the natural <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and agricultural conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <span class="highlight">environmental</span> study also was made, I understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Where development, technical and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations can thus be harmonised and are further supported by the economics of the matter, and still the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> viewpoint is overruled, does not the Treasurer agree that the professed concern of his party and his Government for the environment, which it is said was an important factor in their winning the last election, is humbug and a sham? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of legislative and administrative measures which ought to be taken in order lo ensure the wise and effective management of the Australian environment and of Australia’s natural resources; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The terms of reference relate to the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of legislative and administrative measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the House in passing the recommendation for such a committee will accept that it will not be a committee that deals only with wildlife measures, whether they relate to flora or fauna, it is to deal with the wider <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects as they affect man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The immediate objective of the Bill, in setting up a Pipeline Authority is to enable it to acquire the 5 ordinary shares of the East Australia PipelineCorporation Ltd, which are wholly owned by Australian Gas Light Co. Full feasibility studies have already been completed by overseas consultants on behalf of East Australian Pipeline Corporation Ltd. A survey was made of a chosen route and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact studies provided to the New South Wales Government in respect of 3 distinct routes linking Gidgealpa and Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of these companies are carrying on with borrowed funds and have been seriously embarrassed by the 5 months delay during the New South Wales <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact inquiry and consideration of the Commissioner’s report and findings, which have not yet been published. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has been quibbling and has tried to put the blame on to the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is quite obvious that the Minister cannot blame the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Completion of construction has been already delayed for four months, pending completion of an <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Impact Inquiry constituted by the Government of Nev/ South Wales, and consideration by that Government of its recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr James Donald, who will be the Executive Member of the Pipeline Authority, is in a position to call tenders within three weeks of publication of the recommendations of the <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Impact Inquiry, and can award the necessary contract within fifteen weeks thereafter, and commence construction in 27 weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The completion of the construction will be either 85 or 110 weeks, dependent on the final route recommended by the <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Impact Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They can lead to resources being channelled into uneconomic activity and, in the process, may have questionable <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Language and communication difficulties are legion, to say nothing of the long neglect of ethnic, cultural and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations which constitute a challenge to educators and sociologists alike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-115-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the virtues of utilising the Camp Hill site, which as all honourable members know but the public at large may not know is the site immediately behind this Parliament House - the King O’Malley site and I think, the area where the King O’Malley memorial is located - as against the Capital Hill site is that Capital Hill will be left with all its <span class="highlight">environmental</span> virtues, its softness and its greenness which Canberra deserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the face of the raging controversy about the utilisation of Black Mountain for telecommunications purposes, it could be regarded as some placation for the environmentalists, the conservationists and the people who are concerned with ecology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The manifestation of the regional problem lies in the economic costs, the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems and the social problems which are the result of this population concentration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first prong should be the commencement on an annual basis of selected regional growth centres to accommodate up to 300,000 people each throughout Australia away from the existing cities; secondly, there should be metropolitan redevelopment to help overcome problems of population and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> pressures in the major cities; thirdly, the provision of general incentives and subsidies to assist country areas to overcome their existing economic disadvantages to industry, commerce and investment and also the social disadvantages for the people; and the fourth prong is that State governments should be given every encouragement to continue with their selective support in country towns generally to maintain a healthy and viable growth rate in those towns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is the case there will be greatly increased pressure on the Dandenong Ranges, the Mornington Peninsula, Westernport Bay and other areas of <span class="highlight">environmental</span>, recreational or ecological interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any case, the project, along with many other projects which were handed on to us when we came into office, was reviewed by the Coombs task force which also recommended that on economic grounds and because of growing <span class="highlight">environmental</span> concern we should not continue to support the project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Treasurer told the Parliament that the Government would support a wide range of activities in the fields of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection and conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Environmental</span> protection is an endeavour which has been conspicuous for its neglect by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only does the Budget make an inadequate allowance for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> improvement but the Minister whose area of responsibility is directly involved has yet to make any statement to this House outlining his activities during the past 9 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian environmentalists in all the groups in which they are active will be rightly disappointed with the meagre provisions this Budget makes for the vital concerns of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> improvement and conservation and its promises and pledges in the area of the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was explained to the Committee that the operation of the Parkway systems involved in this proposal does not depend on the proposed Molonglo Parkway, which has been the subject of an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study shortly to be subjected to public inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am satisfied that as a result of this reference to the Tariff Board there will be an overall assessment of the whole of this very important Australian industry and that there will be some aspects which have never previously been considered by governments and upon which they have not taken advice, such as the location, safety, employment and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects which hitherto have been ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For ‘those reasons and on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> grounds - not for political purposes - I believe we would have come to the same conclusion even had there been technical reasons purely from a civil aviation point of view to support the establishment of an airport at Towra Point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is perfectly clear that those considerations still obtained when the Minister for Transport either announced or arranged for an announcement to be made in the Press that regardless of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations he was going to put the new airport at Towra Point, a decision which was changed - although at the time it took no notice at all of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations - to Galston without any <span class="highlight">environmental</span> examination whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a personal explanation in that I have been accused of making a decision previously on political grounds and I am explaining that there were grounds - <span class="highlight">environmental</span> grounds - and that they were important grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This British firm of R. Travers Morgan and Partners worked with an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> study group established, so far as I understand, by that committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of this investigation the Galston site was rejected decisively in the recommendations of the Commonwealth-State committee on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> grounds and also on economic grounds, especially as compared with the upgrading of Mascot airport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, the study by the British consultants was supplemented by investigations by an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> study group established by the committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a group would have taken into account the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects which are particularly important in the case of the Galston area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point I want to make arising out of the speech by the Postmaster-General is that I agree with him as to the great <span class="highlight">environmental</span> damage and damage to the quality of life that would have been caused if an airport had been established at Towra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was it one that we would consider as perhaps we might consider an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> study by a joint committee comprising members drawn from both sides of this House which was established to look into the damage to the environment done by this proposal? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Government has shown by so many anti-decentralisation actions in the Budget that it is not genuinely concerned about the future viability and prosperity of rural Australia or for that matter about the many <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and social evils of disadvantaged metropolitan living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever its <span class="highlight">environmental</span> implications, does not the Minister agree that the altering of section 75 and section 76 of the Income Tax Assessment Act is a form of discrimination against Pitt Street farmers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It said that there is a general cultural failure to relate the emotional and physical aspects of sex and to see them in the context of moral and social responsibility, that all the evidence emphasises that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors, especially in the home, are far more important in regard to the ultimate outcome for the child than whether the pregnancy was planned or unplanned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as I am aware, copies of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement on, for instance, the tower on Black Mountain have been available to members of the Parliament, as they have been available to members of the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I might add that nowhere in the world are people yet completely satisfied with the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement technique. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Developing this technique will not be up to this Government alone; it will depend largely on the community’s perception of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the community is aware of this, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements will rectify more readily what many of us perceive to be errors in decision making in the country, not limited solely to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps the first chapter of this rather sorry episode concerning the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations was the fact that the Minister was not even at the Cabinet meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have vast quantities of coal, but the extraction and use of coal have presented such persistent <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems that, today, less than 20 per cent of our energy needs are met by coal and the health of the coal industry is seriously threatened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In many ways, the story of the improvement of air pollution control in Newcastle symbolises many of our real <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, a further exemption was granted and, by letter of 24 July 1973, the then acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Control in New South Wales,  Mr Lewis,  advised that he had been informed by the Minister for Health,  Mr Jago,  that the company had informed the Health Commission that it would not install air pollution control equipment on the obsolete plant and that, if required to do so, it would close the ferro alloy plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The attitude of the Bureau of Roads did differ slightly from that adopted by the Minister for Transport and me, but I have been informed verbally by officers of the Bureau of Roads that the full report will clarify their attitude and will clearly disclose that on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and social grounds they see no reason why freeways in inner city areas should be proceeded with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the New South Wales Government will change its view, because we believe that the money being spent on freeways in inner city areas is a misallocation of resources and we hope that the New South Wales Government will not continue to pour money into building huge freeways which will solve no problems but will create greater social and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I represent a suburban area of Melbourne and probably the most important sources of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> pollution there are either industrial pollution or pollution resulting from automobile emissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only in this way will the most important source of urban <span class="highlight">environmental</span> pollution in any case be satisfactorily tackled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are many other <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters on which I would like to speak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Environmental</span> conservation is therefore concerned both with the quantity and quality of many different resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conservation of land for agriculture, for forestry or for leisure alone may not be in the best interests of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> conservation as a whole which aims to harmonise all resources with the minimum of conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I have no desire to drink water that has passed through a treatment plant, an engineer in charge of one of the pollution and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> stations was quite happy to drink the water that had passed through the London sewers and had been treated in the London system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When analysed in the calmer atmosphere that should prevail in a department such as that headed by the Minister, we should, if we find there are risks of an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> nature which cause us to question politically made decisions, be strong enough to be outspoken and to have those decisions changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we find that the resources of the nation are spent in saving something which, if the public had been alerted previously, could have been saved at a fraction of the cost and the balance of the money used for saving that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> resource could have been spent in preserving other significant assets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I congratulate the Minister for making it a condition for grants that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact of the project must be considered in formulating proposals for assistance and, if the impact is likely to be significant, demanding that an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement be prepared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All too often the important <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences are overlooked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Already at the University of Sydney the students themselves are calling for the introduction in their courses of the teaching of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> laws, or as <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, there is no doubt that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> law, both statutory and common law, will come to be of increasing importance to legal practitioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Environmental</span> legislation will percolate through to all levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been a course in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> resources law established at the Australian National University. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition it is understood that before a final decision is made as to which particular airport site is preferred the State Planning Advisory Council will require an <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Impact Statement on each of the alternatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>(3 and 4) In the event of consideration being given the actual establishment of a second airline airport to serve Melbourne, as an Australian Government project, then public hearings primarily dealing with the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact would be arranged in accordance with the recently announced policy of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Failure to research the project from either an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> or commercial viewpoint and lax administration have resulted in the haphazard growth of poorly equipped farms run by untrained farmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study has been carried out, though it appears that the company has not released the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only sense of realism in this matter has been injected by the Secretary of the Building Workers Industrial Union who pointed out that unionists are likely to withdraw their labour because they take the view that an industry which is potentially dangerous to the health of people, or could have a deleterious effect on the environment should not be established until an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement has been prepared and published so that the community can see it and comment on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the potentially hazardous nature of the proposed plant, the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study ought to be freely published and the community should be able to comment upon it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I base my statement on the incontrovertible fact that our future social welfare, health, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and cultural development depend on the extent to which our effective growth and development are expanded to meet the demands of an impatient society, a society entitled to expect to benefit from and to share in the good things of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>From this it was concluded that the motor car was creating social, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and economic problems and greater emphasis should therefore be given to the development of public transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As is known in New South Wales the sewage discharged off Sydney beaches in many cases is untreated and, in fact, is creating grave <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It needs to be more emphatically recognised - I really want to drive this home if I can - that children are born into a wide range of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another fact of life is the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument develops when we come to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> reasons which include such factors as ease of study, whether the child’s parents talk intelligently, and whether they keep up with contemporary matters and news. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these things are included in the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is safe to assume that what the Government is saying to us at this stage is that the trend, in its opinion, is such that those people who are disadvantaged on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> grounds should receive some inequality of treatment in order to bring them up to another standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this point of time one would think that the Government would be saying quite plainly that it sees the time coming when the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> grounds in which all children are brought up are so level in this country that all children will be able to have pride, no matter where they were born, in being able to get up and say: ‘I won a government scholarship’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>From what I can learn, it appears that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences were not taken into consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister has just said that we live in an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second prong is a metropolitan redevelopment program to help overcome problems of population and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> pressures in the major cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the Australian Government has taken every precaution to safeguard the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> standards of all growth centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, they have taken account of the limiting factors, such as <span class="highlight">environmental</span> conditions, facing Australian farmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We aim to make our judgments taking into account the full circumstances of each new project or proposal, including such factors as the size and location of the proposed project, the use made of advanced technology, marketing arrangements, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects, labour relations and Aboriginal interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the many complexities which the reports have revealed, a final decision on the commitments of the capital funds required will be deferred pending the preparation of an adequate <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement, study of the constraints identified by  Mr Smart  in his report, and pilot research into the space and feed requirements of large turtles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such an agreement will both overcome the backlog in sewerage services and provide improved treatment facilities at modern <span class="highlight">environmental</span> standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that before any development takes place in any virgin area of land it should be essential that an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study be carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much of the sort of further reforms that the Liberal and Country Parties will suggest will be involved in the area of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and preventive services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The magnitude of the task facing this Board is better understood when note is taken also of the treatment works that need to be built to meet acceptable <span class="highlight">environmental</span> standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The positive <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and health benefits that will result from the moneys provided in this legislation flow only from the initiative of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adequate sewerage facilities and the efficient treatment works for the discharge of effluent of acceptable standards are basic essentials of any <span class="highlight">environmental</span> management program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A quality of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> management at this level is being increasingly demanded in our modern society - and rightly so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But where we consider that freeways create <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems we certainly will not contribute to their construction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following a question asked of my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Conservation on 5 March I wish to make available for the information of honourable members the <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Assessment - Proposed Aerodrome on Lord Howe Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We heard, in very short order, how this proposal would lead to a black hole, an oven in summer, an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> disaster and a claustrophobic squash court - just to mention some of the more restrained criticisms made at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the intention of the Australian Government to do all it can to ensure that Australian investment in overseas countries will benefit the people in those countries and will be favourable to ownership and control of enterprises by people in the countries in which it is made and will have advanced labour relations and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This accelerating groundswell of opinion which signals the folly of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> despoliation, combined with the change that has led to leisure and recreation no longer being the preserve of the few, has led to the recognition that the factor of socio-economic interdependence must be central to the development of a balanced and sensitive national tourism plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Maribyrnong, the Minister for the Environment and Conservation  (Dr Cass),  who has done more than any man I know to subvert one decent <span class="highlight">environmental</span> organisation in Australia thinks that this is amusing, but he will not be in this Parliament after the business either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government policy can ensure that the firms in the industry adopt policies which conform with broad economic and social objectives of the Government at a lower cost by legislation in areas such as taxation,  <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and safety standards, and restrictive trade practices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A comprehensive <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement was prepared to consider the main <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects of the Googong Water Supply Project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement identifies a number of areas which will require careful attention during the development of the project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The principal cause for concern relates to the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement referred to in the second reading speech of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In his second reading speech in the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> context the Minister states:  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit it is an absolute disgrace that Parliament does not have this <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement before it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The absence of an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement with this legislation has exposed the Government as a humbug. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But here is this great champion of the conservation cause presenting legislation with admittedly widespread <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences knowing that in fact an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement is in existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I, like the honourable member for Corangamite  (Mr Street),  raise the point that it is regrettable that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study has not been tabled and has not been made public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that in the future any proposal for a project of this type will be accompanied by an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study for the benefit of those who are concerned about <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not want to delay the House, but I am sure that the Minister for the Environment and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  will quietly agree with me that with every works project of this type there should be tabled an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study, whether it recommends that the project go on or whether it recommends that it should not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I mentioned yesterday when the House was debating the proposed Googong Dam project, it can be confidently expected of this Government that adequate documentation always will be available, that proper surveys always will be carried out and that it will always make available to the Parliament the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact studies made in respect of such projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is vital, if we are not to lose some of our accessible natural assets in Port Phillip Bay and its beaches, that sewerage and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> conservation programs continue to receive substantial financial assistance from the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With all the modern community’s wish to overcome the pollution and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> hazards in life, it amazes me that there has not been a greater outcry in large cities about traffic noise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The root cause of this questioning is the neglect of social and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> needs and failure to provide for the participation of the community in vital decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from the serious need to look at the social and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects of freeway development, there is an important need to ensure that finances provided for urban arterial roads and urban public transport upgrading are closely co-ordinated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I appointed him on a basis of goodwill, thinking he would make some constructive contribution to the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issue, but he resigned without notification <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the first time money for the necessary <span class="highlight">environmental</span> works has been provided to the Western Australian authorities by a national government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to see as part of every sewerage program which involves Commonwealth Government money an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as the Government’s requiring <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements as a condition of funding sewerage programs, I should like to see innovative investigations carried out by the Department of Urban and Regional Development or the sewerage authorities on other aspects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the low quality of planning and organisation can be identified as one of the reasons for the Government’s failure in the various <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As well as presenting a health threat to swimmers, some of the constituents of sewage are blamed for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems such as the killing of vegetation on our sand dunes and our beaches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consequently in relation to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters in connection with Port Phillip Bay the Premier of Victoria sought a further $3.95m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> viewpoint we not only want to sewer all urban areas but also to make sure that there is <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection of all areas, such as Port Phillip Bay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has a national responsibility as part of its interconnected policy It believes that everything is connected to everything else in urban living and it is taking upon itself a responsibility to work with State and local authorities in providing sewerage works and in ensuring proper <span class="highlight">environmental</span> standards for our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those terms will assist the sewerage authorities to improve their <span class="highlight">environmental</span> levels and lower their debt burden, and will assist the States, local sewerage authorities and local government authorities to get on with the job of sewering all our urban communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are concerned with the quality of the water and the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> approach in the same way as we are concerned with purification, which will cost us enormous amounts of money because of neglect in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be a further amount for investigations into the planning, manpower, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and training implications of further developments of the national sewerage program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, firms of management consultants with a similar wide field of interest and expertise were engaged by the Pilbara Study Group, a joint Federal/State body, to provide specialised technical information on various aspects of developmental projects such as port development studies, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> studies, infrastructure studies, town planning studies, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to reports in which it is stated that the Australian Government is to hold a public inquiry into the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects of the establishment of the Redcliffs petro-chemical project in the Spencer Gulf area of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will commence soon after the report being prepared by the consortium on the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences of the proposal is made available to the South Australian Government and this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This will deal with important aspects of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> concern, in addition to nature conservation, aimed at halting man’s unthinking degradation of the total environment, the genesis of life on this planet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The major aspect which has been dealt with in this report is the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> side of the problem and covers such things as road design; construction and maintenance; the roadside environment; traffic engineering, including signs, signals and markings; town planning and the transport system, including alternatives to the private vehicle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">environmental</span> cost of community disruption of these new expressways was considered by the Committee to be vastly in excess of their value of saving lives compared with new alternatives that were put before the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The policies and principles need to cover, among other things, an analysis of future energy supplies and alternatives under a variety of assumptions; an evaluation of their costs and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects; and analysis of the manpower, financial, material, transportation and other constraints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless there is a diversion of public sector spending to the cities and regions we cannot combat the host of urban and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems which have been created by years of indifference, opportunism and uncoordinated planning by previous governments and in some cases many of the State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe it can be brought about by a government preparing public <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In developing an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement the policy, the plans, the development and the intentions could be explained to the public and criticisms invited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I start first with the subject of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The following suggestions for an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> policy may appeal to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, to continue with some of my suggestions regarding <span class="highlight">environmental</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems which I believe should have been tackled earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know where the fault lies but it is disappointing that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry is taking place only now when there has been so much delay already in this industry getting under way, an industry, I repeat, which is vital for my State of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have had problems with Aboriginal land rights and there are now <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations that have been taken into account over quite a period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would take approximately 2 years for a satisfactory <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement to be prepared and at least 8 years to build a plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be noted that on page 49 of the paper, under section 6, ‘Urban and Regional Development NEC and the Environment’, the section headed ‘Protection of the Environment’ deals with Department of Urban and Regional Development initiatives and we find that $250,000 is listed within that category for a national air monitoring program and $100,000 is listed for an education program to develop a public <span class="highlight">environmental</span> awareness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Really, this Parliament should be able to discuss the role that officers of the Department are playing in the United Nations <span class="highlight">environmental</span> program, where Australia stands with regard to the Earthwatch program and what Australia is doing about the exposition on human habitat; yet, because of the very nature of the way in which things have been presented, this Committee does not have the opportunity to examine those programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has become trendy amongst governments throughout the world to talk about <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other day the Minister for the Environment and Conservation  (Dr Cass),  the honourable member for Gwydir and I heard a gentleman who is very skilled in the field express his concern about the use of the word ‘impact’ in the term ‘<span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements’ because it has some connotation of force, confrontation, the adversary principle in examination and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If such are found to be environmentally unsound or harmful to health such information might be attached to the product in much the same way as the smoking warning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was particularly pleased to hear the most helpful comments on overseas trends made by the honourable member for Scullin and his reference to the attitude overseas to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> studies and statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It sees itself as an ‘<span class="highlight">environmental</span> advocate’ to the Government, which remains as the decision-maker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I direct the Minister’s attention to the urgent need to develop a school for teaching <span class="highlight">environmental</span> law because I believe that lawyers should be trained to intervene more in these matters and it would be - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nowhere is this more clear than in the field of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Despite all the warnings and the forebodings there still seems to exist among people who are the supporters of the free enterprise system the belief that the government has no real role in determining <span class="highlight">environmental</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the survey by the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, the preliminary design assessment and the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study can be completed by February next year it should be possible to make a decision and start the final detailed design in March. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, in certain areas, they are vast concrete jungles, as it were, which we might term <span class="highlight">environmental</span> prisons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This has to be done by the use of economic, social and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> criteria applied at the national level rather than the State or regional level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have studied very carefully the papers associated with this matter, including the report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, and I think I am able to say in answer to the honourable member for Diamond Valley that any cause for anxiety which he may have had in respect of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters and things of that sort, including danger from radiation, can be removed from his mind and the minds of the people in that region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill seeks to improve consideration of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors in the Government’s decision making through use of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement technique and public inquiries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government’s proposals reflect its belief that, in the past, insufficient attention has been given to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations when decisions were being taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the most important piece of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> legislation ever to be considered by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement procedure introduced through this Bill represents a development and improvement of policies adopted by the previous Government in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That Government had required impact statements to be prepared on environmentally important proposals being considered by Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In considering requests by State governments for financial assistance for major development projects, the previous Government merely required assurance that associated <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors had been suitably investigated and taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, it will be used to ensure that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects of mining and woodchip proposals are thoroughly evaluated before any decision is taken on export licences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These extensions merely use Australian Government constitutional powers which, because of the indifference of earlier government to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues, were never applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government will have to rely to a large extent on State government advice in assessing the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences of proposals in which it is involved and which are being developed in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although we will be limiting the requirement in terms of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> importance of a proposal, we will not be limiting its scope in terms of the type of proposal that could be the subject of a statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The statement will be required to set out the need for the proposal, the objective of the proposal, the alternative means of reaching that objective and the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects of these different alternatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, where the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences of a proposal are considered to be particularly significant, or where there is considerable public controversy over these consequences, a public inquiry will be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The assessment of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences will be conveyed to Cabinet at the same time as the proposal itself is put to Cabinet for consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus we will ensure Cabinet considers the economic, technological and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences of proposals at the same time, before any decision is taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The procedure will not give to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations a veto power in decision making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Environmental</span> considerations will become an integral part of the information upon which a decision is taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should also question- I hope the study questions itwhether or not a bus service is environmentally sound. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So I compliment the Minister on his study and I ask him to consider the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> facets of the study as well as the pure economics of the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that it is a mixture of good and bad because in the total evaluation beyond economics we must consider the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In saying that it could create demand I mean that a double track is more likely to increase the desire for urbanisation of this area, and increased urbanisation could be in conflict with the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> planning of the Dandenong Ranges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One must plan with an overall, total, integrated view so that one produces an economically and environmentally sound plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>where operations or future operations for the recovery of minerals or excavations or other works are contemplated provide an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact assessment related to these operations prepared by those proposing to engage in the recovery of minerals, excavations or other works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister could quite rightly claim that he has introduced <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection legislation which gives the Minister power to call for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact assessments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This makes other Commonwealth departments responsible for the submission of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact assessments in areas where there is Australian Government involvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I have no doubt that the Minister for the Environment and Conservation who is sitting at the table would, in fact, as a matter of course demand that an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact assessment be provided with regard to any operations that may be contemplated within a reserve or a national park another may not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the thinking of many well informed environmentalists around the world that it is probably better to allow mining to take place where there is mineralisation and where it may be considered to be in the national interest provided the mining is undertaken according to very strict guidelines and under the codes of the plans of management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, before any consideration is given to the possibility of mining I think it should be mandatory that those who are going to take part in the mining exercise, whether it be done by the proposed Petroleum and Minerals Authority, by private enterprise or in association with an authority of the Australian Government, should undertake an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact assessment to ascertain the likely effect upon the environment within that park and the area adjacent thereto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know what the position would be but whatever is contemplated in this area I believe that there should be an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact assessment that relates to these operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If anything should be done in a national park which is of such <span class="highlight">environmental</span> significance as this, an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study should be conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in essence it becomes a sort of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study procedure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this separate legislation, which with a bit of luck we may debate later today or tomorrow, is to ensure that anything that is considered of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> significance, and quite clearly mining in a national park in anyone’s estimate would be environmentally significant, in which the Australian Government has a say and for which it is responsible- and unfortunately we can only hope that the States will follow this lead because we cannot impose anything upon them- will be subject quite apart from the plan of management which will have gone through the whole vetting process which has been discussed, to our <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Bill, which will insist that an EIS or <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study be drawn up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that statement it was announced that the Government had decided to introduce a system of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements designed to protect the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite frankly, from memory, that was the first time that 1 heard the term <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from being notable for the introduction of this legislation the month of November 1974 must be remembered and be regarded as an appropriate time to contemplate the present and future status of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nation’s first few <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements have been released so that we can decide, with a reasonable amount of confidence, whether they are worth the time and expense which is involved in their preparation and, more importantly, whether they will be an adequate vehicle for bringing <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations into the processes of government decision making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill we are debating gives the Minister power to ensure that any project of any organisation or agency or, indeed, the Commonwealth Government or any project involving Commonwealth funds within the States which is likely to have a significant effect on the environment should be accompanied by an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will take a lot of courage from the Minister to try to exercise the sort of influence which will be necessary to satisfy the public on the one hand and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> action groups on the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If loan works were to be made the subject of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact studies the consequent delays would mean without doubt that it would be impossible for approved allocations to be expended in the same year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would mean that preplanning, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact studies and design work would have to be carried out at least a year in advance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have read that message into Hansard because I think that the Government needs to take into consideration whether the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact proposals will cover the applications from the States for funds from the Australian Loan Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>whether the Commonwealth has either the constitutional right or the heed to be concerned about the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects of projects financed from borrowings by the States or its instrumentalities as the result of an agreement on total borrowings at the Loan Council meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the Commonwealth has the constitutional right to insist on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> satisfaction with respect to works- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole tone of this legislation is one of apparent desire for dominance by the Commonwealth Government in an area where the majority of the problems are those which must be faced by States and local governments and for which the States have at least as good if not better expertise for the consideration of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation seems to be saying that the States have not looked after <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters and they must be subject to some oversight on the grounds that some of the matters which may arise will have national as opposed to local, regional or State significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is precisely to overcome such an attitude that the standing committee of the Australian Environment Council established a working party to put forward the principles which should be observed in the assessment of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects of projects and these principles were agreed to by the Council at its last meeting late in 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commonwealth Government to accept advice that any project has been subject to an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessment of its effects in accordance with this agreed set of principles and of the outcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There appears to be no disagreement between the States and the Commonwealth that projects of various kinds need to be assessed so that the decision makers are aware of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects when making decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There seems to be no disagreement with regard to the procedures and principles for making an assessment of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects of any particular project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There seems to be no disagreement that the Commonwealth Government is justified in seeking <span class="highlight">environmental</span> satisfaction with regard to all projects for which it has some constitutional right to seek that satisfaction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Victorian and the New South Wales Governments have moved as far as, if not further than, most governments in the whole of the Commonwealth to try to ensure that the procedures that are adopted with respect to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessments are in fact sound, and more than just window dressing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the purpose of the Bill was stated by the Minister for the Environment and Conservation in his second reading speech to be the introduction of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study technique into the Government’s decisionmaking processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, as the Mnister stated, there has been basic agreement by State Ministers sitting on the Australian <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Council on what statements should cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, it would appear that the Minister has given a great deal of power in calling for or refusing an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Others see them as advocates to Cabinet or as <span class="highlight">environmental</span> policemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once having done that, I am sure that we will be able to develop a degree of respect and confidence amongst the community at large for the importance of taking <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors into account before taking decisions on a whole range of projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bill is the most important <span class="highlight">environmental</span> legislation to come before the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a speech to the Academy of Science on 29 November the Minister for the Environment and Conservation  (Dr Cass),  when he was discussing <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact techniques, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be subject to enhancement as a result of experience and the assessment of the significance of findings on proposals subject to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is very little Australian literature on the technique of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impacts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As yet all the States do not have manuals on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now a new department has been set up and it is combining <span class="highlight">environmental</span> control with planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In South Australia recommendations of the Environment Protection Council on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements have been approved by the South Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Western Australia there is still no official policy and one can say that the need per se for an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement is not yet fully recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite obviously we are all in the same boat as far as <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clauses 6 to 10 concern <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement techniques. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim is to protect the environment by 2 means- the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement technique and the hearings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that the aim, desire and hope of the Government is that when major development proposals are being considered it will be just as logical for business, for a government authority or a government department to make an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessment as it is to make a feasibility study. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact I see cost benefit economic analyses or economic studies being just as much a tool for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements as I do for economic feasibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps when we do an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study on this form of energy production we should look at coal production, the side effects of uranium, the problems with fuel oil and all the rest of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again there is a need to look at these things in cost terms to get a proper <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To conclude in general terms, I have had some doubts about <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also appears to me that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement techniques tend to ignore people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study was conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Few people could disagree with the statements of the Minister in his second reading speech when he refers to the virtues of legislation of this type, as distinct from this Bill, and its clauses, and one could be very much inclined to accept the view that to speak about the environment and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences when we are looking at important developments, is almost the same as speaking 10 years ago about the virtues of the family and family life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The word ‘<span class="highlight">environmental</span>’ has a corresponding meaning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the concept of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements ought to be widened in the public mind to accept a social responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that this definition will be more important in the future when the concept of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements is seen to be wider, particularly when government proposals are being looked at. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He stated that these arrangements provided the public with minimum opportunity to influence the decision on an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister inform the public of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact studies as they are initiated from time to time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could find nothing dealing with <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements or dealing with the important national parks and wildlife legislation before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the Galston decision would clearly indicate that a government, where government interests are concerned, could arrive at a decision without regard to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors and it could do so in exercising this sort of discretion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen numbers of young lawyers, particularly at Sydney University, express concern at the lack of teaching at the moment of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> law within universities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an important principle here that the community ought to have locus standi to be able to undertake themselves where <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors are involved and are influencing the decision makers and they ought to be able to do it particularly by bringing pressure to bear through legal action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again in this legislation, which is the second Bill dealing with the environment and conservation which has been before this House today, there are matters relating to civil liberties which appear to be in conflict with the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection and impact proposals that we have before us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member referred to the duplication and triplication of the preparation of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government will have to rely to a large extent on State government advice in assessing the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences of proposals in which it is involved and which are being developed in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see no danger of and am not concerned at the possible duplication of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that full consideration is given to the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors involved in the Government’s decision-making through the use of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement technique and public inquiries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions for the publishing of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements and the conduct of public inquiries are in line with the Australian Labor Party’s policy of open government, of informing the people, of enabling public participation in the decision-making process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent years increasing concern from all parts of the political spectrum has been expressed that inadequate consideration was being given to the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effect of decisions taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally, economic and technical considerations have overridden the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of our existing <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems of today- of noise pollution, air pollution, waste disposal, reduction of amenitywould not have arisen if there had been procedures available for a complete assessment of the impact on the environment of the proposed developments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Sydney region, Botany Bay would still have most of its own natural qualities if <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessments had been carried out before industries and port developments were commenced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concept of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessment is not new. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We aim through this Bill to protect the environment in 2 ways; firstly, by use of the information obtained in the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessments themselves- the factors threatened, the alternatives and the best course to follow having in mind a full consideration of all factors involved; secondly, by the educative process inherent in public hearings that may be held in association with the preparation of assessments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people may see the need for preparation of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessments as another round of red tape to be overcome- a further unnecessary cost to be incurred by the taxpayer and a possible further delay in the planning process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that, unlike the past when economic considerations were the prime considerations that influenced the decision-making process, in the future consideration of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact of proposals will take place along with the consideration of the economic features, hand in hand: that is, a parallel process, a marrying of the econ. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It goes without saying that this legislation will mean there will be considerable scope for co-operation with State <span class="highlight">environmental</span> authorities- a complementary activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus it is expected that as experience in the use of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessment technique develops, a decision on whether or not a proposal should be the subject of an impact statement will become a relatively simple matter and the preparation of the statement will be part and parcel of any initial consideration of a proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact legislation had been in existence since Federation the 8-year argument over Blackbutt Reserve would have been avoided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The people of Stockton in the Lyne electorate would not be subjected to the discomfort and the irritants of air pollution from nearby Kooran.gang Island if an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement had been prepared prior to the construction of its industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Coal trucks blighting the whole of the Hunter region presently could have been avoided if there had been <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements into mining development and transport of coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In accordance with its current practice, the Australian Government also reserves the right to consider the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> implications of projects prior to agreeing to provide funds for those projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the proposed takeover is judged to be not against the national interest on this basis, the following additional criteria will also be taken into account: Whether, after the takeover, the firm concerned could be expected to follow practices consistent with Australia’s interest in matters such as exports, imports, local processing materials produced, research and development and industrial relations, including employee protection; and whether the takeover would have adverse consequences in terms of the Government’s objective for defence, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection or regional development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-79-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the reasons that I voted for your party in the last 2 Federal elections was that the ALP policy seemed to offer some hope that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues within the community would be resolved by democratic- and ultimately by legalprocess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by saying once again that I hope that this incident, which will become known as the Fraser Island incident, ushers in a new era where governments in future will never undertake or give approval to development projects of this kind without first undertaking an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study- an assessment- and making the result of those studies public, and without giving the public an opportunity to put their case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He gave the people in the area and the conservationists great encouragement when he declared his attitudes and said that it was his intention to prevail on the Government to take measures to arrest the sand mining operations until such time as a proper <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study could be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The sand mining of Fraser Island is now seen by conservationists throughout Australia as a betrayal of trust by the Australian Labor Government that promised that export licenses would be withheld pending satisfactory <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements stop Dillingham Mining Company claims to have received export license in December stop Stopping wanton sand mining of Fraser Island provides a test case of sincerity in conservation matters stop The devastation can be avoided by decisive action by the Australian Labor Government stop We urge Australian Government to summon the courage to stop this wanton rape of the irreplaceable wilderness area <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The minerals are named-  derived from new sand mining ventures, the precise source from which the mineral is to be obtained should be stated together with full information concerning the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations and safeguards that have been submitted to our colleagues the Ministers for the Environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress the word ‘new ‘-  for these minerals to be accompanied by an identification of the precise source of the mineral and by evidence that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences of the mining operations have been studied and found to be satisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as this might require the preparation of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements for submission jointly to the appropriate State and Australian Government Departments concerned, I suggest that this specific matter be referred to our respective Environment Ministers at the meeting which we agreed at our Conference on 7 June should take place shortly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This issue confronted the Committee with a problem that arises very often in matters relating to transport, that is, the need to achieve a proper balance between <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations and the need in a rapidly expanding city to provide the citizens of the city with increasingly efficient modes of transport and access to and from different parts of the city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present it seems that any industry established following satisfactory resolution of the technical and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems associated with the mining would be of small to medium scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-35-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, at this stage, the Executive considers that appropriate areas for study might include trace elements, minerals and vitamins; nutritional status and energy metabolism under varying <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and socioeconomic conditions; the impact of tehcnological and social developments on dietary patterns and nutrient intakes; nutrient values of foods; and biochemical aspects of nutrition in relation to growth and development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact still remains that we have been able to conduct public inquiries and assess <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements from State governments before legislating because we have been able to get the co-operation of the State authorities and because, in the circumstances, there have not been commercial interests at stake that could make a claim of prior commitment in the way in which the sand miners were able to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee believes that the planting rate is excessive and that because of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> disadvantages associated with the program it ought to be reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main reasons for the Committee recommending a reduction in the planting rate are: (a) Future demand may not be as great as forecast due to a lower rate of population growth and lower consumption rates than those predicted; (b) future supplies may not be as scarce as expected due to the availability of long-term supplies from New Zealand with whom we have a free trade agreement; (c) the planting program has continued with little heed for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> values especially where the clearfelling of areas of native forest is involved; (d) the financial returns and balance of costs/benefits may not be sufficient for the continuation of the commitment of public funds over such a long period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Emerging from the Committee’s examination of this legislation have been some serious <span class="highlight">environmental</span> shortcomings which the Committee believes require most urgent attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some cases not the slightest concession is made to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> values, the only considerations being ease of planting and ease of harvesting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second is for greater research to be conducted into the side effects of softwood forestry upon all the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues raised in the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This involves questions of finance and resource management as well as the important <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Briefly, the facts are that  Mr Sinclair,  on behalf of the Fraser Island Defence Organisation, appeared before the Mining Warden and was heard on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it seems that he took the view that the evidence put by  Mr Sinclair  on behalf of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> movement represented only a sectional interest and was not to be equated or consistent with the public interest at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A mandamus was issued and if I have a correct report of what the High Court judges said unanimously, it was held that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> interest is much wider and much more important than the Mining Warden considered appropriate for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should also inform the House, in conclusion, that legal assistance through the Australian Legal Aid Office was given to the objector and the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> movement right from the beginning; in the hearing before the Mining Warden, in the hearing for the writ of mandamus in the Queensland Supreme Court and right up to the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder whether the northern boundary has been truncated at that point because of a desire not to beg the question of boundaries in the Torres Strait area, but obviously there are areas to the north of the present proposed boundaries that should, at some time in the future, be attached to the park, given the different <span class="highlight">environmental</span> circumstances of some of the islands immediately north of Cape York. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The role of the Bureau of <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Studies is to carry out research and investigations to provide factual information needed by the Department of Environment to enable it to carry out its legislative and regulatory functions and to encourage research in those aspects of the environment where a need exists but which have not been adequately studied by other research bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, the Australian Government would require an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement on programs which involve expenditure of Australian Government money- that is, where the money is identifiable as being Australian Government funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study would need to take into account many factors, including the impact of the proposal on the physical environment, the flora and fauna, and man made materials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the publication of such an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement resulted in public comments which questioned whether the proposal had been considered adequately, then the Minister could call for a public inquiry to follow, although I suspect, and it is expected, that only a small proportion of such statements would result in public inquiries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is extremely important that that sort of assistance be given by the Australian Government and that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact studies and public inquiries be carried out if all people in the community are to have their rights observed and the community rights observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee in recommending the construction of these works has concluded that: (i) The Stuart and Barkly Highways form the main road links within the Northern Territory and its continued development is dependent on the provision of adequate transport facilities; (ii) the upgrading in accordance with the national highways standards is justified and will increase road safety; (iii) the works will reduce the prolonged transport delays now experienced in each wet season; and (iv) the economic and social benefits which the proposed improvements will provide to the Northern Territory community are considered to outweigh any possible adverse <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish briefly to express a concern which really follows upon the concern I expressed in relation to subclause (4) of clause 29, and that is that a party or group of persons may, under the fairly wide criteria which I envisage under clause 29, be given legal assistance in respect of an action which does not involve the prosecution of individual rights, which does not involve an attempt to recover damages or to assert a claim to property, but which might, for example, involve an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> action against a particular company, either large or small. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the Government is saying about Canberra is that if people in other cities must live in squalid, overcrowded conditions with poor <span class="highlight">environmental</span> surroundings, inadequate transport facilities, bad roads and lack of sewerage then the people of Canberra should not expect to enjoy the conditions of a well planned city without being heavily taxed for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I direct a question to the Acting Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development I ask: In view of his answer to the question from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and in accordance with the administrative procedures of the Environment Protection Act, when was the final <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement prepared by the proponent, which I take it was British Airways? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The events of the last 6 months make me doubt whether the Government will give <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters the high priority they deserve, particularly when public health and safety is involved, let alone the protection of our national heritage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last week’s decision to allow the Concorde to fly to and from Australia without preparation of a final <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement is just one reason why I doubt the Government’s intentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The failure of the Government to appoint commissioners to the Heritage Commission and giving it very little financial muscle, the low priority it has given to the preservation of the national estate as witnessed by the Budget measures announced 10 days ago and its failure to appropriate any money for the National Parks and Wildlife Service in the supply Bills last week are just some reasons why all Australians must doubt this Government’s integrity on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example, the Australian Advisory Committee on the Environment, in its report on the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects of supersonic transport aircraft, added a proviso to the recommendation that the Government should not prohibit the operations of Concorde in terms of the necessity to have continuous and extensive monitoring of the stratosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Australia, economic and physical factors have tended to dominate urban planning almost to the exclusion of other factors such as <span class="highlight">environmental</span>, cultural and social aspects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is generally agreed that, in the past, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and, to a lesser extent, social aspects have received inadequate attention in urban planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The failure of both Ministers to comply with those requirements, coupled with the events of the past 6 months, makes me doubt whether this Government will give <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters the priority they deserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That not only entailed the abolition of many positions in the former Department of the Environment, but also meant that the role the Federal Government was playing in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters had decreased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government to appoint commissioners to the Heritage Commission, the low priority it has given to the preservation of the National Estate as evidenced by the budgetary measures announced 10 days ago, and its failure to appropriate any money at all for the National Parks and Wildlife Service in the Supply Bills last week are just a few of the other reasons why all Australians must doubt this Government’s integrity on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the other more startling actions of this Government in relation to the environment, and a matter which is indirectly related to the subject of the debate today, was its high-handed action in directing  Mr Justice  Fox to complete the Ranger uranium <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry by May this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my opinion that this Government not only does not have any commitment to the preservation and improvement of the natural and built environment but also does not even understand the most important <span class="highlight">environmental</span> Act it has to administer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The enactment of this legislation by the Whitlam Labor Government is the only example of formalising <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessment requirements into statuterequirements that most Australians want followed, not ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Section 6 of the Act provided a framework for the introduction of the details of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessment procedure requirements by regulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regulation 8.1 states that if any written comments are received on the draft <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement those comments must be taken into account by the proponent in the preparation of a final <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regulation 8.2 provides that the final <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement, when prepared, will be circulated to interested bodies, including the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development and those people who made comments on the draft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regulation 9.1 provides that the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development shall examine the final <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement on behalf of its Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is no dispute over whether an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement was called for on Concorde flights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>There is no dispute over whether British Airways, through its agents, was prepared to comply with the requirements of that legislation It in fact submitted its draft <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement to the appropriate Minister late last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently comments were received by the proponent, British Airways, on its initial <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a letter to the Minister for Transport the proponent’s Australian agent said, among other things, that the final <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement would have only minor editorial changes to that submitted originally as a draft and that it was its intention to prepare an addendum to the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement which would be its reply to the comments received as a result of the public circulation of the draft <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement earlier this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In point of fact, y saying that the Minister has said that it is pointless to follow the requirements of the legislation; it is pointless to take into account the views of responsible Australians who fear the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> damage that Concorde may bring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister does not even give the courtesy of waiting to see what arguments British Airways uses to refute the criticisms made on the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of Concorde by concerned Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Minister’s opinion, no final <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement is needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those regulations, as I have already said, require the proponent to prepare and circulate a final draft <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, as the honourable member for Reid said, the British Government, the British Aircraft Corporation and British Airways produced a draft <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement on Concorde operations in Australia dated December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the Act that the honourable member for Reid says was not followed-  on the necessity or otherwise of holding a public <span class="highlight">environmental</span> enquiry on the operation of the Concorde aircraft into Australia, in particular to Tullamarine Airport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that the key <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problem for Australia, insofar as it can be determined at this time, is the noise impacts in the vicinity of Tullamarine and upon occasion at any alternate airport to which the aircraft might be diverted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am writing to confirm the agreement we have reached today following our consultation in accordance with the Administrative Procedures of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act of 1974-75 on the necessity or otherwise of holding a public <span class="highlight">environmental</span> enquiry on the operation of the Concorde aircraft into Australia, in particular to Tullamarine Airport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I agree that the key <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problem for Australia, in so far as it can be determined at this time, is the noise impacts in the vicinity of Tullamarine and upon occasion at any alternative airport to which the aircraft might be diverted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Setting this aspect aside, the wider consequences on the global environment have been well canvassed in enquiries in other countries and at this time I do not believe that further knowledge would be gained by traversing these issues again in an Australian <span class="highlight">environmental</span> enquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, in the light of the foregoing observations, I agree with your contention that a public enquiry is not warranted and I am prepared to recommend to the Government that Concorde operations into Australia in the form described in the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement be not opposed on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> grounds subject to: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The British High Commission again confirmed that the draft impact statement with some minor editorial changes will be the final <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement on the question of Concorde visits to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If account is taken of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues and the decision can be made that it can come here on its trial run, the sooner we can let the British know about it the better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seemed to me that as nothing in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> terms stood in the way it was proper that the British be advised as soon as possible of our decision to allow Concorde to come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will give the operators notice, under due process, when we are satisfied about the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The letter, whether from our Department or the British Department, indicated that the proponents of Concorde, British Airways and Air France, had been asked to prepare a final <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, no such final <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement is yet available, at least not at the time the letter was written. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Department informed our Minister that an addendum to the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement would be prepared by it and it would reply to the comments received as a result of the public circulation of the draft <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the United Kingdom and the United States of America required an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement would confirm that our own legislation is not excessive on this score. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next, in section 6 it is indicated that, in order to fulfil this requirement to examine fully and take into account <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects, certain administrative procedures must be followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 8 (b) indicates that each Minister shall do all that is necessary, consistent with relevant laws, ‘for ensuring that any final <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement’- I emphasise the words ‘final <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement’- ‘formulated in accordance with those procedures, and any suggestions or recommendations made in accordance with those procedures, are taken into account, in matters to which they relate, in the department administered by him and by any authority of Australia in respect of which he has ministerial responsibilities’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have to await a final <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But no final <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement has yet been prepared by the proponents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We called for an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement and the draft was received and distributed as required by the administrative procedures, as the Minister pointed out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 9.1 of our procedures requires the Department of Environment to examine the final <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, in the light of the foregoing observations-  which really related to whether there would be a public hearing; it was always the Minister’s right to deny a public hearing-  1 agree with your contention that a public inquiry is not warranted and I am prepared to recommend to the Government that Concorde operations into Australia in the form described in the <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Impact Statement be not opposed . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has to be, first of all, a draft <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your Department have asked that we, as proponents, now proceed with the preparation of the Final <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Impact Statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having studied the submissions received as a result of the procedure for public comments we do not anticipate that any other minor editorial changes to the <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Impact Statement are required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>subject to these editorial changes, the draft will become the Final <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Impact Statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our intention is to prepare an Addendum to the <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Impact Statement which will be our reply to the comments received as a result of the public circulation of the Draft <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Impact Statement earlier this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why has the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study completed by the Australian National Line on its container berth development at Botany Bay not been tabled in Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-52-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (2) There is no legislative requirement for the completed <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Impact Statement to be tabled in Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-52-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think honourable members will be aware of the difficulties associated with <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems that the Australian National Line has run into with trucks carrying goods to and from Mort ‘s Dock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is vital that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and conservation issues be properly weighed in the making of decisions, whether by governments or by private developers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For too long in our history <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues were ignored and many of our greatest man made and natural assets have been destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Environmental</span> issues must be one of the factors considered in each decision, together with other factors such as the economic cost and community convenience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has attempted in too many cases to give <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues an effective veto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is as unbalanced and undesirable a situation in the opposite direction as it was when <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues were not considered at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is expected that the selected consultant, if appointed shortly, would complete the commission of detailed plans and reports, including a comprehensive <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement by late 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In furtherance of the objective of ensuring that matters affecting the environment are fully examined and taken into account, the Government has given very careful consideration to a classified draft <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement prepared by the Department of Defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, in order that maximum possible information, consistent with the interests of Australia be made available to the public, a document titled ‘<span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Considerations of Visits of Nuclear Powered Warships to Australia’ dated May 1976 is attached to this statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is taking these decisions on the basis of international experience with nuclear powered warships and in light of the assessments in the unclassified <span class="highlight">environmental</span> document which I am tabling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those matters are dealt with in detail in the document ‘<span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Considerations of Visits of Nuclear Powered Warships to Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Appropriate arrangements concerning <span class="highlight">environmental</span> safeguards will be applied in consultation with state governments by a group of officials led by officials of the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  tabled a document- as you were careful to point out to him, not for the first time,  Mr Speaker,  he did not need leave to table a document- of in this case over 30 pages titled ‘<span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Considerations of Visits of Nuclear Powered Warships to Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects, both Commonwealth and State, had not yet been investigated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only questions which arise are the questions of absolute liability being accepted by the nation whose flag the ship carries and that there should be appropriate <span class="highlight">environmental</span> safeguards available in Australia in the unlikely event, although obviously the catastrophic event, of some mishap occurring because of that visit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, I wish to make this point: Towards the end of last year the position had arisen in consultation between the Department of Defence and the Department of Environment where my Government was about to make an approach to the governments of New South Wales and Western Australia, to consult them about the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of nuclear powered ships- in this case nuclear powered allied warships- visiting their ports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In what manner the security, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> safety and matters of that nature could be effectively protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proper attitudes, sound planning, and enlightened decision-making, taking account of all the facts, are the whole basis of responsible <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They show also our concern to work with the States and the voluntary bodies, and indeed with the whole community for the improvement of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and conservation standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, on looking through the document entitled  <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Considerations of Visits of Nuclear Powered Warships to Australia  I am tempted to mention a couple of things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seriously question the validity of this document placed before us and headed  <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Considerations of Visits of Nuclear Powered Warships to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is the final <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement on warfare conducted by nuclear powered ships? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Commonwealth financial assistance is likely to be sought for the development of the project, when will an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study be commenced by his Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760817_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-56-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus at this stage there is no basis on which my Department needs to take any action to examine the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760817_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-56-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>satisfactory reception of television programs that would adequately serve the interests of the community in that area could be obtained in that area by the means to be authorized by the permit; or ‘(d) in the opinion of the Board, the use of the means to be authorized by the permit to provide a television service in that area is necessary or desirable for aesthetic or <span class="highlight">environmental</span> reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was done by the enactment of the environment protection legislation, and the appointment of permanent heads of departments that had special <span class="highlight">environmental</span> significance to the Interim Committee on the National Estate, apart from conditions embodied in the legislation currently being amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The majority of people in Australia are concerned with the quality of their environment and are able to make assessments of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of any project likely to threaten that quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real result is that, whereas the principal Act allowed for wide ranging representationa wide ranging Commission, if you likerepresenting not only the States but all the interested organisations such as the National Trust organisations, Aboriginal groups and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection groups, this Act limits the range of expertise available to the Commission and increases their workload to such an extent that the program of saving the National Estate will be put back many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liberal and National Country Parry would provide funds to the States to assist in the preservation of areas and buildings of historical, social, cultural, ecological and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are very real examples of how we are concerned with and are protecting Australia’s <span class="highlight">environmental</span> heritage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is anticipated that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact of the scheme will be largely beneficial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The conservation, development and management of our water resources must take place within a broader framework, including overall economic, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and social planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me remind present Government members of the years preceding 1972 when Australians became frustrated and impatient with the lack of roads, schools, hospitals, sewerage, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection, health care and so on, the dilatory approach to those in receipt of or needing social services and the neglect of the Aboriginal people, which was so bad that when employment figures are quoted now they are inaccurate because at that stage there was no recording of them, or a poor recording of them and lack of attention to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reasons behind Canada’s review of its mineral policy are the same problems that Australia faces, and they are: The effect changes in global economic conditions can have on the mineral industry and on the economic wellbeing of the nation; the close relationship of the mineral industry to many economic and social problems, such as the rate and direction of economic development; the adequacy of supply to the domestic markets; <span class="highlight">environmental</span> control; foreign ownership content; taxation; resource adequacy; and the role of multinational corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a time when unemployment is expected to climb dramatically unemployment benefits are to be cut by nearly $34m; Aboriginal welfare is to be cut by $33m; migrant education by $ 10m; urban and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> improvement programs by $ 142m; while wealthy mining corporations are given rich bounty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The visits take place only after all the proper <span class="highlight">environmental</span> controls have been applied, and my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development is principally in charge of those matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such visits take place only after the fullest possible <span class="highlight">environmental</span> precautions have been taken as they ought to be, as they must be, as they were in Western Australia, as they were in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am glad to say that in spite of his earlier decision, the Premier of New South Wales has agreedthis has now happened- to discussions taking place between <span class="highlight">environmental</span> officers of the Commonwealth and of the State of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development will remember that in the document entitled  <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Considerations of Visits of Nuclear Powered Warships to Australia  tabled on 4 June, it was stated that because the authority for controlling emergency services is vested in State governments, the Commonwealth Government must rely on the States to establish and control the safety organisation in their ports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wrote to a number of Premiers- that was done in June and was not by any means just as a result of this exercise- seeking examination of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues involved in relation to this matter so that nuclear ships could go into as many Australian ports as possible with complete impunity and safety and with all the proper safeguards taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that there will be an answer because it is essential for Australia’s own purposes that nuclear ships be able to enter as many of Australia’s ports and harbours as possible, bearing in mind the necessity to take account of essential <span class="highlight">environmental</span> safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is noted that an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> study into the impact of agricultural chemical use in irrigation and that sort of thing will be required and that this will be subject to approval by the Minister for National Resources  (Mr Anthony). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These could include such vital aspects as flood mitigation, flood plain management, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters, etc., but I must stress that any further changes to the charter of the Commission would still require the unanimous approval of all 4 Governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of necessity, governments are obliged to do 3 things: firstly, to ensure adequate supervision; secondly, to ensure adequate <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection; and thirdly, to ensure that the country’s future is protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He will know that last Thursday his Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development issued a statement that the Government ‘will be looking very closely at the first report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry and will be announcing its decisions’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a greater awareness in the community today of the social and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues and, of course, that is a highly desirable thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the far reaching consequences of the recommendations of the Fraser Island <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact report, will the Prime Minister give an assurance that adequate time will be provided for the proper assessment of that report and the furnishing by affected parties of submissions to the Government prior to a final decision? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there is any doubt in any government department or amongst any government services about the Government’s attitude to the <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, perhaps this answer to the honourable gentleman’s question can be taken as dispelling that doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In trying to eradicate hookworm we have to improve the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> conditions of the people in those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That in view of the severe consequences to the people of the Maryborough-Hervey Bay district, this House should debate the findings of the Fraser Island <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the House generally knows that the main purpose of the discussions with the Premier related to issues involving Fraser Island which involve not only, as I have indicated, vastly important <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues but also issues of great importance, as the honourable member for Wide Bay would be aware, concerning the employment and the livelihood of the people and industries in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The highlight of our <span class="highlight">environmental</span> legislation was the Australian Heritage Commission Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of these legislative commitments were supported by action- action in appropriating funds for projects worthy of our <span class="highlight">environmental</span> goals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is just one more example of its lack of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> commitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Not only was this decision a clear breach of the legislation, but also it shows a complete disregard that powerful elements of the current Government have for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Queensland there are only 6 people employed in the Co-ordinator General’s Department with the responsibility under the State administrative arrangements to look at <span class="highlight">environmental</span> questions arising from the development proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These people never get the chance to comment upon mining proposals because the Queensland Government feels that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues concerned can be looked after properly in Mining Warden’s Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over the past decade, debate and concern about <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and conservation matters have been widespread, particularly as they relate to our natural environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What concerns me, however, is that not all groups supposedly interested in promoting conservation and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues do so with balance or honesty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over the next few months this Parliament will be making important decisions closely tied to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues and the preservation of our national heritage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave- The Fraser Island <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry reported its final findings and recommendations to the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development on 2 1 October 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inquiry took 15 months to reach its conclusions, and is thus a fully detailed and comprehensive review of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> features of Fraser Island and the impacts of the sandmining industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to the evidence in respect of all of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of the making of decisions by or on behalf of the Australian (Commonwealth) Government in relation to the exportation from Australia of minerals (including minerals that have been subjected to processing or treatment) extracted or which may hereafter be extracted from Fraser Island in the State of Queensland, the commission recommends that: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would be of real assistance in employing the men who are hurt by necessary, progressive decisions taken by the Government of honourable members opposite, decisions which we applaud for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Community Development  (Mr Newman)  announced the decision of the Federal Government on the report of the Fraser Island <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case a previous <span class="highlight">environmental</span> report commissioned by the Queensland Government and on which the mining was initiated has been swept aside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear now that the ability of the States to determine and manage their own development will continually be at risk of Federal intervention because of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that State governments should carry the responsibility for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A government or a committee which had a bias or an interest towards New South Wales- I mean New South Wales no mischief in singling it out for this example- could well turn around and bring in a report suggesting that the methods of open cut mining in Queensland were barbaric, and that such operations should be closed down on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has applied the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection impact study retrospectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly everyone acknowledges that consideration must be given to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, having established, in accordance with the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection legislation, a committee of inquiry, we were prepared to await results of that inquiry and then be guided by the findings of fact of the inquiry in order to determine what our future policy should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members look at the record as it is set out in the report of the inquiry or if they look at the parliamentary record they will find that the Minister for Minerals and Energy at that time made it quite clear that any extensions and any further export licences would depend upon the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessment being undertaken by the inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Fraser Island is of great <span class="highlight">environmental</span> importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of aesthetic, historic, scientific and social significance for the present community, and for future generations of Australians, as well as being of international <span class="highlight">environmental</span> significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said he agreed with this- it is difficult to identify any more environmentally significant and fragile area on the Island than that covered by MLs 102, 95 and the nearby mining leases of Queensland Titanium Mines Pry Ltd, MLs 84, 104 and 105. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of decisions having the effect of permitting the mining of all or any of these Teases will involve major permanent and irreversible <span class="highlight">environmental</span> harm to the landscape, vegetation and lakes of the island and, consequently, substantially damage its value to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole concept of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement procedure envisages that people’s rights come first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry should be concerned with the total environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the first page of the report it is stated that the environment- …. includes all aspects of the surroundings of man, whether affecting him as an individual or in his social groupings, and ‘<span class="highlight">environmental</span>’ has a corresponding meaning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would suggest that sometimes on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues that might be an appropriate motto to be adopted by some people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Commission of Inquiry was appointed on 12 July 1975 in pursuance of section 1 1 of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 to conduct an inquiry known as the Fraser Island <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry: … in respect of all of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of the making of decisions by or on behalf of the Australian (Commonwealth) Government in relation to the exportation from Australia of minerals (including minerals that have been subjected to processing or treatment) extracted or which may hereafter be extracted from Fraser Island in the State of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an environmentalist I say to other environmentalists that they should be working to make sure that the people and the workers of the area concerned are not disadvantaged in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are there may be a backlash against environmentalists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the people, particularly the workers, and the companies concerned suffer a great deal, some repercussions will flow to the whole <span class="highlight">environmental</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past year the Government has given no indication at all of any understandings of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has cut back drastically on all major <span class="highlight">environmental</span> commitments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I hope there will be a financial commitment to this side <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It worries me that this is just a sop to the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> groups and concerned Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government may not have the same commitment to the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry chaired by  Mr Justice  Fox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I do not criticise the decision on Fraser Island- in fact I have said very clearly that I applaud it- from an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection point of view I am worried by the way the Government intends to protect the displaced workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the same attitude going to be taken in regard to the first report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a wide-ranging debate covering all <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters affecting the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Covernment cannot make a decision in relation to one inquiry commenced under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act and then ignore the report of another <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report is heavily biased in favour of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations and is apparently written from an extremely narrow viewpoint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report obviously pre-supposes that Fraser Island is the exclusive preserve of environmentalists and scientists . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What really worries me is this: If the Federal Government accepts this as the bible for all <span class="highlight">environmental</span> reports, what will happen to my area of Agnes Waters where the sand mining companies have moved in and have established leases? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister confirm that the final report of the Commission of Inquiry on Fraser Island is primarily concerned with the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of Commonwealth decisions regarding the export of minerals extracted from the island? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member is correct in stating that under the terms of reference of the inquiry the commissioners focused their attention on the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of the Commonwealth’s decision on the granting of export licences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any review of the adequacy of current measures is unsatisfactory if it fails to consider the importance of broader <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not wish to extend the indulgence which the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith has allowed me in permitting me to intrude into the debate but I wish to say that not only should the School of Art not be transferred to Launceston but also that the School of <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Design and Planning must be kept in Hobart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- The Government has received the first report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry which comprised  His  Honour  Mr Justice  Fox, Professor C. B. Kerr and  Mr G.  G. Kelleher as the Commission of Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry has been long and exhaustive and has presented opportunities for all interested individuals and groups within the community to put their views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry should further illuminate particular issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The preparation of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements for uranium mining projects outside of the Northern Territory may now proceed but the Government will not make final decisions until the Commission of Inquiry has made its second report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements will need to take account of any physical and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> safeguards appropriate to mining sites set down in the inquiry’s first report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is therefore setting in hand, subject to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> requirements, action in relation to: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are concerned about the economic and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences of the continuation of agreements like this and we are concerned that the studies undertaken by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and the Forestry and Timber Bureau are not public and may have overlooked many important issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The operations of the Softwood Forestry Agreement Acts of 1967 and 1972 with particular reference to their <span class="highlight">environmental</span>, social and economic impact and make appropriate recommendations as to the form of any future softwood industry agreements legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Standing Committee was concerned that the existing program did not pay enough attention to economic and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement should be called for from the States before they are allowed to clear fell native forest areas for the planting of softwood forests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediate consideration should be given to providing financial assistance to the States for the regeneration of hardwood areas in a way that ensures maintenance of forest diversity and other <span class="highlight">environmental</span> values. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why do we not have a policy to regenerate native hardwood forest areas for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> purposes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They highlight the need for an independent inquiry into the forestry industry to look at the economics, the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects and the effects on our soils and watersheds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned, firstly, with the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of this Bill and, secondly, with the fact that it is providing employment that is so needed today in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I am interested in the environment, I am not a rabid environmentalist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recommendation (vi) states that money should not be loaned to the States for the planting of softwoods in areas where native forest is to be clear felled unless, of course, a thorough <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study is produced and various other aspects, such as sou quality, show such areas to be suitable for the planting of softwoods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister, in his second reading speech, said that an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement was not required on this occasion before these agreements were to be entered into with the States because the time taken would halt the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, however, further agreements are to be entered into I would sincerely hope that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements will be required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I restate that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact studies and statements should be produced by the States for the various areas that they wish to plant with softwood forests in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  shows a deep concern for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Due to the complexity of the problems connected with forestry and the paucity of knowledge on its <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and social effects, this approach may appear to be cautious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague the honourable member for Petrie  (Mr Hodges)  made some comment about the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> hazards of softwood forestry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the areas might be quite stable and there may be no effect on the water quality but to date one has the impression that too little examination has been done in the way of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements for the foresters or the public bodies concerned to be able to say with certainty that water quality, the habitat for our native fauna and a number of other matters would not be affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the appeal for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements is a reasonable one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If not, will the Minister tell the House how a speaker at the demonstration had a copy of his statement on the Ranger uranium <span class="highlight">environmental</span> study approximately  VA  hours prior to its being delivered in this House? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conservation, development and management of water resources must take place in the broad framework not only of development and management of resources generally, but also of overall economic, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and social planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The philosophy which the Australian Water Resources Council proposes seeks to maximise community benefit, having regard to economic growth, the impact on social wellbeing, on regional development and on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> qualities generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most significant <span class="highlight">environmental</span> studies undertaken to date, and continuing, relates to the waters of Westernport Bay and the catchment area, including groundwater. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important point I emphasise is that this was an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> study under a conservation ministry laying down a policy which will allow development of resources without damage to a sensitive and significant coastal and water environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before works could commence the Government required an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> study to be presented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general terms, the investigators found that no major <span class="highlight">environmental</span> defects would result from the proposed works, although the exclusion of the public from parts of the catchment area of the Thomson Dam is causing concern to a large number of people and to local government authorities in the Latrobe Valley area of Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Prime Minister: In view of the favourable reference in the Fraser Island <span class="highlight">environmental</span> report totimber harvesting activities on Fraser Island, will he give an assurance that such activities will not be affected in the event of Fraser Island being declared part of the National Estate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Station will therefore be instrumental in the development and proliferation of livestock herds which are better adapted to our <span class="highlight">environmental</span> conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister’s justification for siting the power station at Newport is to achieve a political objective and not an industrial or <span class="highlight">environmental</span> objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is seeking to use a declining and valuable resource, in natural gas, for that station in order to arrive at an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study was conducted it has been disclosed that the power station will be changed over to other forms of fuel if natural gas becomes in short supply, and that it will be a continuing rather than a peak load station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister is not to exercise any of those powers unless it is necessary to do so for purposes of safety or <span class="highlight">environmental</span> emergency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That this House is of the opinion that in all future <span class="highlight">environmental</span> investigations involving industrial or mining projects any recommendation to terminate, phase out or to alter the projects be rejected unless the following considerations are satisfied: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing demonstrates more tragically the inadequacy of the Fraser Government’s response to the report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry than its obvious determination to evade and misrepresent the findings of the inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Justice Fox and the two commissioners from the Ranger <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry have attacked the Government over its interpretaton of the Fox Report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, these fears have been unnecessarily inflamed by emotionalism on the part of certain <span class="highlight">environmental</span> groups and fanned by irresponsible utterances of Labor politicians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In informed debates there is agreement, on both sides of the nuclear power issue, that uranium mining carried out under today’s tight regulations is neither an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problem nor a health hazard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their empty statements on safeguards, controls and concerns about nuclear war do nothing to mask their basic concerns with advancing the interests of uranium mining companies, regardless of the social and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> costs that ordinary Australians may have to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The magnitude of the problem that this Parliament is now discussing cannot be compared to the possible pollution that can be produced by a Newport power station or the possible <span class="highlight">environmental</span> destruction of a Fraser Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr Deputy Speaker, this debate encompasses the contents of two documents, the first report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry and the Ministerial statement by the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  in respect to the supply of Australian uranium under existing international contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry or the Fox Report, as it is known, is a document of international significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has engaged and is engaging in a massive deception, and the Fraser Island decision in respect of the dishonouring of contracts following the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> report is but a throw-away to the environmentalists in Australia to gain some ground for the Government to move rapidly into the development of uranium resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to quote one part of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry Report which the honourable member for Blaxland  (Mr Keating)  was not game to quote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1) and (2) As announced to the Parliament by the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development on 10 November, the Government has reviewed in detail the findings and recommendations of the final report of the Fraser Island <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry and has decided that the export of minerals extracted from Fraser Island, other than from below high water mark on the beach south of Indian Head, should be phased out and export should not be permitted for minerals mined after 3 1 December 1 976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-43-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us deal with the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issue first before getting down to the issue of whether the Newport power station or something like it is needed in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The project has been the subject of the most detailed examination on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Melbourne seems to ignore the fact that the <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection Authority in Victoria has looked into this matter in the greatest detail and completely cleared the project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the fact remains that only 4 per cent of all strikes have been politically motivated or motivated by sociological reasons such as <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues just briefly we can see why the unions are so concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the history of the granting of the licence for the power station in Newport we can see that in fact the Government pressured the <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection Authority and the Appeals Board in a way which enabled the Newport power station to be given the okay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that after the first decision by the <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection Authority the State Electricity Commission appealed it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the matter went to the <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection Authority Appeal Board the Board increased the allowable limits for ozone in the atmosphere so that the power station could get a licence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To give the House an idea of the enormous increase, it provided a standard of 1 3 parts per 100 million for ozone in the atmosphere compared with 6 parts per 100 million laid down by the World Health Organisation and 8 parts per 100 million laid down by the United States <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst those inquiries were going on the Victorian Government let contracts worth $100m relating to Newport despite the fact that it did not have <span class="highlight">environmental</span> approval. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the fault of that government because it took quite precipitate action in letting those contracts before it had <span class="highlight">environmental</span> approval. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So when it is said in this House for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> or other reasons that mining needs to be looked at suspiciously in the Australian environment and needs to be curbed in the Australian environment- that is the background of many of the statements- that is a grossly incorrect proposition to put. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Inequitable economic growth, reflected in the wide disparities in wealth which now exist between countries and between human beings and which condemn millions of people to a life of poverty, without satisfying the basic requirements for food, education, health services, shelter, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> hygiene, water and energy; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Social, economic, ecological and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> deterioration which are exemplified at the national and international levels by inequalities in living conditions, social segregation, racial discrimination, acute unemployment, illiteracy, disease and poverty, the breakdown of social relationships and traditional cultural values and the increasing degradation of life-supporting resources of air, water and land; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The nations must avoid the pollution of the biosphere and the oceans and should join in the effort to end irrational exploitation of all <span class="highlight">environmental</span> resources, whether nonrenewable or renewable in the long term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All acts by nations and people should therefore be inspired by a deep respect for the protection of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> resources upon which life itself depends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such policies must be an essential component of an over-all development strategy, linking and harmonising them with policies on industrialisation, agriculture, social welfare, and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and cultural preservation so that each supports the other in a progressive improvement in wellbeing of all mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Health is an essential element in the development of the individual and one of the goals of human settlement policies should be to improve <span class="highlight">environmental</span> health conditions and basic health services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In achieving the socio-economic and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> objectives of the development of human settlements, high priority should be given to the actual design and physical planning processes which have as their main tasks the synthesis of various planning approaches and the transformation of broad and general goals into specific design solutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the planning and management of human settlements, Governments should take into consideration all pertinent recommendations on human settlements planning which have emerged from earlier conferences dealing with the quality of life and development problems which affect it, starting with the high global priority represented by the transformation of the economic order at the national and international levels (sixth and seventh special sessions), the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact of human settlements (Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment), the housing and sanitary ramifications of population growth (World Population Conference, Bucharest), rural development and the need to increase food supply (World Food Conference, Rome) and the effect on women of housing and urban development (International Women’s Conference, Mexico City). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matters to be discussed will encompass the preliminary thinking of the government in this area as outlined to the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry, the measures proposed in the first report of that inquiry and recent international developments both in this field and in relation to other initiatives for the strengthening of the international non-proliferation regime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-56-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I am pleased to say that when we are considering matters of historical interest and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters oft-times party barriers disappear substantially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the measures announced on 1 1 November 1976 by the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, the Government’s attitude is that policy decisions in relation to the further development of the Australian uranium industry will have to await the outcome of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-92-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will no doubt recall that following the chain of events resulting in the termination of sand mining on Fraser Island I sought and received from the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  assurances that the traditional timber harvesting activities on Fraser Island were not under threat as a consequence of the report of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> commission or, for that matter, from the ambitions of those who might seek to damage or destroy an industry which has served Maryborough and Australia for over a century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee recognises that all State governments are aware of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> dangers of ORV use and that some States have introduced control measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, we feel that all State <span class="highlight">environmental</span> authorities should give earnest consideration to the recommendations of this report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First, I would like to repeat some of the remarks I made when I tabled the first report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry on 11 November 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry should further illuminate particular issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also said that  Sir Brian  Flowers, the former  Chairman  of the United Kingdom Royal Commission on <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Pollution which published in September 1976 its report on nuclear power and the environment, has publicly lamented the lack of rational debate on nuclear power in Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While it awaits the final report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry, the Government has conducted a most thorough preliminary investigation on the whole question of nuclear safeguards, both as they apply in Australia itself and overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be interesting to also note that I, through my Department, sent about 1000 letters to interested groups and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> organisations in all States telling them that the Department would make available to them, if they so wanted, the Fox report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Further, it is available to all public libraries and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and conservation group centres and offices which we could find. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We know that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters have a very low priority under this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">environmental</span> arguments are just as compelling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The preparation of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements for uranium mining projects outside of the Northern Territory may now proceed but the Government will not make final decisions until the Commission of Inquiry has made its second report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever there is to be mining development, particularly in uranium, the Government calls for an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the Government realises that there are <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors and that safeguards regarding health and pollution must be given great importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One must look at the safety aspect and the pollution and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspect of the question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would like to see whether, for example, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors were considered in relation to transport and other functions of local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In reaching its findings the Committee will take into account all relevant factors- economic and financial, social, technical, operational, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and land use, and community attitudes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While the committee will continue its study on the locution of a plant in South Australia no firm negotiations of any kind will be entered into until the final report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry has been made public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are some small formal <span class="highlight">environmental</span> questions still to be answered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been a reappraisal and some general adjustment of thoughts in respect to the question of how this area should be treated from an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the things that occurs in a discussion of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of a national park is the balance between the tourist emphasis and the national park aspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any support for such a proposal shows a lack of knowledge of people in the Territory, and the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations that there are in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are the zero population growth advocates, those sceptical of economic growth for its own sake, others concerned with conservation and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues and those who fear, quite simply, that the country needs time to digest the postwar influx of immigrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Equally significantly, transportation can help to create the urban designs and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> changes necessary to make the transport system work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Combining transportation with other development programs through the use of air rights over highways is also a means of supplying needed space at economical prices and of overcoming the unwanted <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects of expressways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently the Australian Environment Council, which is also comprised of State and Commonwealth Ministers responsible for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters, has moved to form the Vehicle Emissions and Noise Standards Advisory Committee (VENSAC) to deal with problems associated with vehicle emission control enforcement at the local level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-12">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>State and local governments are primarily responsible for purchasing and holding land for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and conservation purposes and it is for them to determine their own priorities when allocating funds for the acquisition of such land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements presented to the public for comment by Commonwealth instrumentalities are considered to be drafts and no serious attempt is made to present a finished statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-88">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For this reason public comments often add greater depth and understanding to the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessment of a project made by the proponent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-88">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are willing to keep open minds on the subject, and my Government has consistently said that no firm decision will be made before the second report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry is received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The world reserves of coal are relatively very large but it is by no means clear that coal could be mined on the scale that would be needed to meet growing energy demands, or that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems arising from its extraction and use would be acceptable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand, nuclear power introduces <span class="highlight">environmental</span> risks and problems, and some of these appear unique in their implications for society . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The study has not yet reached the stage where an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement is appropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-57-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He will remember the different accounts that were given last November and December by the Minister who represents him in the Senate about the letter which  Mr Justice  Fox gave to him concerning the interpretation that had been placed on the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry’s first report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be recalled that, following the release of the First Report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry, the Government announced in the House on 1 1 November 1976 that it supported the Inquiry’s view on the need for the fullest and most effective safeguards on uranium exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Government has repeatedly emphasised, this remains a matter for consideration following receipt of the final report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this respect the Government’s policy introduces a requirement additional to those recommended by the Ranger uranium <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry in its first report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of this requirement also, the Government’s policy extends beyond the recommendations made by the Ranger uranium <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry in its first report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This requirement is additional to those recommended by the Ranger uranium <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry in its first report and reflects similar concerns to those expressed by the inquiry in relation to reprocessing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>These requirements also translate into concrete policy measures concerns expressed by the Ranger uranium <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason, although the Ranger uranium <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry in its first report did not make a recommendation on this matter, the Government has decided that it is desirable that, as a standard practice, a clause should be included in any future contracts for the export of uranium from Australia noting that the transaction is subject to safeguards as agreed between the importing country and the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It builds on the preliminary thinking of the Government described in testimony to the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry last year, as well as the recommendations of” the First Report of the Inquiry itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Action taken to achieve a social or <span class="highlight">environmental</span> end such as green bans would seem to us not to be exempted by the exemption clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The sorts of problems which he struck and which I have had are things like the need to have cooperation and co-ordination with the States, the need to avoid duplication- duplication between governments going over the same ground and duplication between industry and governmentsthe need to give industry early warning of requirements in the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consideration of the project, and the need to make sure that the people nearest to the problem are helping to solve the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the Government’s decision in relation to the recommendations of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry will be made in the light of knowledge of the issues of major concern to the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-56-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This goes against all the other issues which we mentioned to the Attorney-General such as <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues where environmentalists and other groups want to get legal aid, and they need it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an all embracing clause which would pick up all the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues such as the Fraser Island group or other groups which have an interest in getting assistance for matters which would not come within the normal ambit of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Respectfully urge that you seek amendment to section 6k of the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Bill to depoliticise the determination of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> legal aid by allowing the Commission to consider <span class="highlight">environmental</span> groups applications on merit without a waiting reference by Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that a person cannot get legal aid for a number of important matters such as <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues or the issues he might want to contest as regards a local planning scheme where a council says: ‘You are going to be zoned out of existence’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All these other actions, whether they relate to restrictive trade practices or <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues, are no longer to be funded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The restrictive trade practices legislation, consumer protection, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues and other matters are all matters that are coming before the Federal Parliament now and people are entitled to receive legal aid in those areas as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would guarantee that assistance would be given to organisations such as the Fraser Island Defence Organisation and the others involved in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If someone is affected by a disturbance in his <span class="highlight">environmental</span> amenity, for instance, because a pipeline is being built somewhere, he should not be concerned about whether it is a pipeline constructed by a gas corporation chartered by the State or a pipeline chartered by this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  said earlier in the life of this Parliament that there would be a wide ranging debate on the second report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry during the Budget session, I prepared myself only for a speech on the ministerial statement about the nuclear safeguards policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament now has before it the final report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These were, of course, very clearly recognised in the reports of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inquiry is of course in the nature of an advisory body on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters and has made a number of recommendations to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw attention to the section entitled Conclusions in chapter 13 of the First Report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It incorporates and builds on the findings of the first report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quoted as the basis for the last major speech I made on this subject in the House of Representatives 2 extracts from the first report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquirythe Fox report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>You have not really thought about the international <span class="highlight">environmental</span> interest or the dangers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us leave the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> questions, the global environment interests and the moral questions aside for one moment and dwell upon the market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That move in some countries has been temporarily held up by <span class="highlight">environmental</span> objections and the general view that nuclear power is undesirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They have no regard for the global <span class="highlight">environmental</span> interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The information we have before us is the first report of the Ranger Uranium- <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry- the Fox report- which deals with the export of uranium and which really comes under 5 headings, namely, the dangers associated with mining and milling, the dangers associated with the operation of nuclear reactors, the dangers associated with the safe disposal of nuclear waste and the 2 key questions of terrorist activities and nuclear proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second Fox report deals not with the general problem of export but with the specific problems of the Northern Territory and has drawn attention to very serious and difficult problems concerning <span class="highlight">environmental</span> control, respect of the rights of Aborigines and national parks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, we must see that State and Federal <span class="highlight">environmental</span> laws for uranium mining and export are coincidental. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must not have a situation where a mining company has to meet 2 separate overlapping <span class="highlight">environmental</span> requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fast breeder reactors certainly have unsolved <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But the people of this country are entitled to know and to be exposed to the pros and cons of the many matters that have been the subject of deliberation by the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot has been said about the second report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report enters into considerable technical and administrative detail on the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> controls and monitoring arrangements it proposes should mining proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It even recommends that the landscape setting proposed in the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement prepared by the Ranger mining interests be substantially altered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He appeared to me after listening to him to be really explaining why there is absolutely no point in Australia keeping its uranium in the ground and why the report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry- the Fox report- is quite correct in stating that no matter what we do in Australia or what we recommend it is not going to make an ounce of difference to what happens in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry second report stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Anyone who looks at the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems of society today realises that the attitudes on environment of the active capitalist and the active communist coincide, with equally bad results for their communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the industry of the capitalist society the profit motive means that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors are probably amongst the last to receive consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nature of the debate has not allowed me to refer to either of the Ranger <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry reports as we had hoped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have studied the first report of the Ranger uranium <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry and now I am studying the second report with some interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If an American supersonic aircraft had been constructed and was now operating, the demands of those working in the factories building those aircraft would have overcome the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems surrounding its use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-This is a cognate debate on nuclear safeguards policy, the uranium industry and the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose I could also include the third subject of this debate, the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry, under that heading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This debate which flows from the first report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry and now encompasses the recommendations of the second Fox report and the statements of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  on safeguards policy is an important element in the Government’s consideration of the technically complex, diverse and internationally significant issues associated with uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has stated time and again that it would not make its decision until the second report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry had been received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that speakers in this debate from both sides of the House have comprehended many of these issues, drawing them together in a consideration of nuclear safeguard policies, the potentiality of the uranium industry itself and the reports of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 2 reports taken together represent a major contribution not only to Australia but also to international understanding of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences of the uranium industry in the broadest terms as it affects mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Commissioners’ own words, it is a uniquely sensitive <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consideration particularly when applied to the Alligator River area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For its part, the first report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry helped crystallise many of the issues and enabled the Government to take that issue further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the first report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry the Government, in formulating a policy in this matter, has taken into account the report of the Australian Safeguards Mission which was made late last year, the Prime Minister’s correspondence with  President  Carter and Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada and the recent visit to North America by the Acting Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  and several other Australian Government officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As set out in the Government’s statement of 1 1 November following the First Report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry, the Government is satisfied that appropriate controls would apply to the shipments under these contracts which will be used for electric power generation in Japan, the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany, all of which are parties to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inquiry and these reports epitomise in a most comprehensive and profound way what <span class="highlight">environmental</span> concerns are about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The end point of an inquiry is the recommendations it makes, in the first place to the Minister responsible for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters and then he- that is myself in this case- in turn carries them to the Government as a whole for its decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I finish on this note: As the national Minister concerned with the environment, I state that the thrust of the many recommendations of the inquiry seems to me to be entirely consonant with proper <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Thus, I would like to see further administrative arrangements developed which are consistent with the discussions I have been having with my counterpart ministers in the States on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As indicated in the Working Party’s report, the Biological Conservation Committee was not in a position to report on its terms of reference and the governments agreed that the work of this and of other committees would be superseded by committees which have since been established by the River Murray Commission, including an <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Study Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-33-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further issues of longer term policy significance raised in the submission, such as flood mitigation, river management and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection, will require more detailed examination by the appropriate committees that have been established by the River Murray Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-33-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has his attention been drawn to page 3 of the 5th Report of the Royal Commission on Petroleum which states that there is a clear conflict of policy looming between the national economic interest and the requirements of State Governments, particularly in implementing policies calculated to have some <span class="highlight">environmental</span> benefit, notably those relating to vehicular emissions, lead and sulphur levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-33-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Department also arranges community forums such as the recent ‘National Housing Conference- Housing and the Community’, and the proposed national conference on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> education which provide an opportunity for the exchange of ideas on such issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 16 August, the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  asked me if I would table cables and a letter of 8 November 1976 from  Mr Justice  Fox allegedly concerning media and stock exchange speculation on the Reports of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Group is conceived as a small, informal and unofficial body of highly qualified people convened to assess the current and prospective patterns of nuclear development in the light of pressures imposed not only by energy demand but also by <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and security factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During this stage all the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of the proposed development will be taken fully into account through the environment protection administrative procedures to ensure that the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">environmental</span> legislation is complied with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770824_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement will be required in time to enable it to be adequately examined prior to the granting of any production licence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770824_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition notes that the project will be subject to an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement, but it needs to be reassured that such an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry is conducted by the Commonwealth perhaps with State participationbut certainly not left solely to the State of Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770824_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Evidence gathered by the Government indicates overwhelmingly that it is not feasible to construct a parallel runway system at Sydney airport without enormous financial, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and social costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770824_reps_30_hor106/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There must be a much better way of solving these <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and transport problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770824_reps_30_hor106/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>by leave- Since the tabling of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry’s first report on 1 1 November 1976, there has been a wide-ranging debate inside the Parliament and in the public arena. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It looked at both the world-wide and the local regional <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues associated with the mining and export of uranium: the issues of nuclear weapons proliferation and nuclear safeguards; the contribution of nuclear power to world energy requirements; the economic implications of uranium export for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is now satisfied that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> control and industrial health measures proposed by the Inquiry and accepted by the Government, will provide proper regulation and control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry Report stated that total renunciation of intention to supply Australian uranium was not justified and was undesirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The vast uranium reserves of the Alligator Rivers Region are located in an area of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and Aboriginal significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger project will proceed subject to the full range of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> controls recommended by the Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is completely in accord with the recommendations of the Ranger Inquiry and will provide a proper and adequate basis on which uranium development will proceed so as to harmonise the interests of development, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection, National Park values and Aboriginal welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In coming to this conclusion, the Government is satisfied that the comprehensive and interlocking administrative arrangements I have already described, which will govern development, will provide the necessary protection of <span class="highlight">environmental</span>, Aboriginal and National Park values in the course of development and operation of Ranger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to satisfactory completion of the necessary <span class="highlight">environmental</span> requirements and conclusion of arrangements with the Aboriginal people, the Government will take a decision on development of the Nabarlek deposit by Queensland Mines Limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existing deposits are at different stages of investigation and there will of course be different <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and other requirements necessary in each case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to satisfactory completion of the necessary <span class="highlight">environmental</span> requirements, the Government will also take decisions on the development of projects in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In coming to these general conclusions on Nabarlek, Jabiluka, Koongarra, on development in the States and on the question of sequential development, the Government is conscious that particular decisions must await the outcome of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes it is not appropriate at this stage to come to decisions which could pre-empt <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consideration or foreclose the Government’s intention to take decisions in full knowledge of facts that may arise at a later stage, including the careful monitoring we will maintain of the overall impact of activity on the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- When it took its decision to proceed with uranium mining under the stringent safeguards already announced, the Government gave the most careful consideration to the views of Aboriginal leaders as recorded in the Second Report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry and to the Inquiry’s recommendations on Aboriginal interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will also outline some of the major <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues considered by the Government in taking its decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In taking its decision on uranium mining, the national park, and Aboriginal land rights, the Government has been guided by the two reports of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry commissioned under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I stated in the House of Representatives on 2 June 1977, ‘the two reports taken together represent a major contribution not only to Australia but also to international understanding of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences of the uranium industry in the broadest terms as it affects mankind’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Principally because of the wide ranging nature of the Ranger Inquiry, I have decided that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact of a number of the matters considered by the Government and announced today have been adequately examined and taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Inquiry has identified the major <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues and has made recommendations accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To adopt strict <span class="highlight">environmental</span> controls and standards in relation to uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first finding of the Ranger Inquiry the Commissioners took the view that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects of uranium mining could be adequately regulated and controlled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The disposal of nuclear waste and the potential <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems which this could pose have been matters of public concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The responsibility for disposing, in an environmentally responsible manner, of waste arising from nuclear power generation in countries abroad, is a matter for those countries which generate electricity by nuclear means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Prime Minister has said, the issue of nuclear waste disposal has been examined by a number of eminent independent authorities including the British Royal Commission on <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Pollution, the Ford Foundation and the Ranger Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These elements will be based, where possible on existing international and overseas codes, and will assist in making <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection practices and procedures developed overseas more widely known in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Environmental</span> standards, procedures and practices will be specified in the uniform Code. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Inquiry has noted the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems that resulted from uranium mining at Rum Jungle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The establishment of a national park in this Region is central to the findings of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was seen as a means to minimise adverse social and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impacts which might occur with the development of mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before any mining proceeds we need to be assured that any social and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects are acceptable, having in mind the overall impact of development in the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Second Report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry recommended that environment protection of the Alligator Rivers Region could be accomplished in two ways, of which the establishment of a major national park was first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These recommendations relate to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> supervision, research, and the establishment of standards, monitoring and administrative arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has decided to appoint an officer, to be known as the Supervising Scientist, to exercise a supervisory and integrating role over all research and monitoring programs associated with <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection from the hazards of uranium development in the Alligator Rivers Region and to advise on the specific <span class="highlight">environmental</span> requirements for the Ranger project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As recommended by the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry the Supervising Scientist will be responsible to myself as Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development and I hope to announce an appointment in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this body will be to provide the Supervising Scientist with a small number of highly qualified research staff to assist in the development and management of the multi-disciplinary integrated research programs that will be necessary for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection of the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This committee will co-ordinate the formulation of standards and procedures and control measures for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection in the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before such decisions are taken the Government will need to be satisfied about the acceptability of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact on the Region of the development of the mine concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The application of the Act to other mining proposals in the Region will ensure that the Government will have all the facts on the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> implications of these proposals when decisions on them are required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the national Minister concerned with the environment I believe the thrust of the many recommendations of the Inquiry to be entirely consonant with proper <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection, and it will be clear from my statement today that the Government takes a similar view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague, the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  has in addition outlined the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> controls to be adopted by the Government and he briefly referred to some of the health aspects of these. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Code deals with radiation protection aspects only and is not concerned with the other potential hazards or with the broader <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues already elaborated on by my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Code was accepted by both this and the previous Government and was submitted in the evidence my Department gave to the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Code does not deal with the broad <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues of mining and milling of radioactive ores, its provisions are to be applied by operators of mines or mills in the context of comprehensive <span class="highlight">environmental</span> studies made with respect to any proposal to mine or mill radioactive ores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many of them now regret their decision on both economic and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With regard to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects, I and members of the Government committee on natural resources went to Arnhem Land and the Alligator River province last year and looked at the projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has made it perfectly clear that Australia’s uranium may now be mined subject to the most stringent <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and health conditions at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Whitlam Government’s policy statement made it perfectly clear that that Government put the mighty dollar before the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and safeguard conditions which must now apply before Australian uranium can be mined or sold overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of those reports was to advise on the worldwide and local <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues associated with the mining and export of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is well satisfied that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> control and industrial health measures proposed by the inquiry and adopted by the Government will provide proper regulation and control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe we are in the hands of a government of social and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> vandals who have not a care at all for the rest of humanity for Australia’s advantage as long as they can make some more dollars or as long as they can divide the community for their own political advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me quote from a talk by  Mr Kelleher,  one of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry commissioners, to the <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Engineers Conference in June this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The disposal of nuclear waste and the potential <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems which this could pose have been matters of public concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The responsibility for disposing, in an environmentally responsible manner, of waste arising from nuclear power generation in countries abroad, is a matter for those countries which generate electricity by nuclear means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although coal is plentiful and world production can be expanded, this will bring with it associated <span class="highlight">environmental</span> difficulties as it has done in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that coal brings about <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems; therefore it was desirable not to use coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me, from all I have read and from all I have heard, even with the unbiased mind that I have on the question, that the use of enriched uranium for the production of power or for any other purpose will create far greater <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems than the use of coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very importantly, the people who appeared before the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry provided a vast range of viewpoints and attitudes towards the matter and a vast amount of factual material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have had to acquaint themselves with a vast array of complex <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those uranium deposits which do not concern Aboriginal lands and the mining of which complies with proper <span class="highlight">environmental</span> conditions into which public inquiries are about to take place will of course be available for export and in due course for processing within Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To produce and export the equivalent quantity without proper <span class="highlight">environmental</span> safeguards, designed to minimise the further potential risk from proliferation, is not acceptable to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already Australia is suffering from the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects of a fossil fuel powered economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Environmentalists ought to cogitate upon that problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>under Carter’s scenario a total of 1,000 million tons of coal a year will be extracted but under rigid <span class="highlight">environmental</span> strictures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Uncontrolled coal mining has wrought <span class="highlight">environmental</span> havoc in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that there is a nuclear coal trade off where the economics may make little difference where the decision between the two and the proper mix of the two may depend therefore on an assessment of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and social costs and risks associated with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have warned Carter that he is sailing on a collision course if he wants more production, more <span class="highlight">environmental</span> purity and more safety regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether one welcomes or deplores the fact, electricity generation will become more and more dependent on uranium over the next 50 years, or at least until a further abundant source of energy without radioactive or otherwise dangerous <span class="highlight">environmental</span> waste is available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would have been refused on <span class="highlight">environmental</span>, ecological or any grounds whatever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were opposed then- I go back to the years 1967 and 1969- because coal would be a source of carbon monoxide development in the world, that there would be hothouse and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The background paper titled ‘Health and Safety Aspects of Nuclear Power Generation’ which was published with the documents outlining the Government’s decisions quotes from the British Royal Commission on <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Pollutionthe Flowers Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry also dealt with this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note what  Sir Brian  Flowers,  Chairman  of the United Kingdom Royal Commission on <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Pollution, said in a report on the nuclear power industry published last September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are few subjects in the field of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> pollution to which people react so emotionally as they do to radioactivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that at the moment the fast breeder reactor poses substantial <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very early in the public debate that has been proceeding for some time I resolved that I would not come to a final veiw on the subject until after the presentation of the two Fox reports by the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry and after I had had the opportunity of assessing some developments overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A second reason for Japan favouring a nuclear power generation program is an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Australia when we talk about the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problem as it relates to uranium mining and export we think in terms of the waste disposal problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was designed to enlist support for my representations to the Government to ensure that the requirements of the Fraser Island <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry’s final report would be fully met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not propose in the few minutes available to me to canvass the rights or wrongs of the decision made on the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issue but the fact is that, as a consequence of that decision, very many Australians are suffering hardship and distress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only proper that the people of Australia, through the Federal Government, should compensate those people adequately, as urged by the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry itself in the recommendation to which I referred before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To suggest that the mining company commenced operations with indecent haste to thwart the ambitions or the intentions of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry is quite mischievous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In actual fact on 16 March 1975, some few days before the announcement was made that an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry would be conducted on Fraser Island, the company had expended $6m on pre-mining activities and the construction of plant for that project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object of this Act is to ensure that the significant <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues of any Commonwealth action are thoroughly examined before decisions are taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was with this object in mind that he directed the preparation of an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement on the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Authority’s proposal to extend its 132kv sub-transmission around Belconnen and North Canberra, including the extension along the Mount Ainslie-Majura foothills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extent to which the provision of this Act will be applied to future proposals for areas of national importance will depend on a variety of factors including the form of the proposal, the extent to which <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters (in the widest sense of the phrase) have been taken into account and the extent to which public review of the proposals is allowed for or encouraged in any future Australian Capital Territory legislation covering conservation matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally the second Fox report was honest also about the grave <span class="highlight">environmental</span> hazards associated with all aspects of the nuclear industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">environmental</span> pollution problems led to the Ranger Commission’s suggestion for the modification of the Ranger mine proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For both <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and economic reasons it is not in Australia’s best interests to encourage fast breeder reactors or take any action which would hasten the development of fast breeder reactors in countries overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliamentary Labor Party’s <span class="highlight">environmental</span> committee had a representative of the Atomic Energy Commission address it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the problem of pollution is concerned, the uncertainty about waste disposal was shared by the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger report at page 187 in a postscript which was printed after the first report had been prepared refers to the Flowers Royal Commission on <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Pollution and spells out the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But here was a chance, with three uranium deposits which could go ahead subject to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> study. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the cuts is in expenditure on public hearings in respect of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry identified a number of defects in the then existing safeguard arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry was set up by the Labor Government to investigate the safeguards and requirements that would be necessary if Australia were to enter into the rnining and export of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only thing that we have done during the whole of the debate on nuclear energy in Australia has been to insist that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> safeguards and normal safety procedures should be well and truly established- that the waste, the rubbish that lasts for years and years, should be disposed of with safety to the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1969, when the Jervis Bay prototype reactor was first mentioned, it was the Labor Opposition which insisted that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of the disposal of waste should be very thoroughly examined by the then Government In order to prove my point, let me quote an answer given on 19 August 1970 by the Minister for National Development to question No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he make available the reports on the (a) (i) geological, (ii) hydrological, (iii) hydrographical, (iv) meteorological, (v) ecological and (vi) <span class="highlight">environmental</span> investigations carried out at each of the sites considered for the building of a nuclear power station and (b) ability of each site to dispose of the radioactive and thermal waste from the proposed reactor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real reason that Prime Minister McMahon, the Prime Minister of the day, cancelled the project was that the experts- the same experts who are being quoted now in relation to the disposal of nuclear wastecould not decide on the type of reactor that was required; did not know what <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects it would have on Jervis Bay; had no idea where the waste was to be disposed of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, I believe that there are good economic as well as <span class="highlight">environmental</span> reasons for sequential development, as  Mr Justice  Fox and his commissioners recommended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the growth of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems in the United States, Japan and Western Europe challenged the supremacy of oil so that oil was not in fact going to be the foremost source of energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has followed very closely the decisions of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry and its recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the Government’s decision on uranium mining and export the matter of monitoring arrangements in the Alligator Rivers Region will be considered by the Supervising Scientist and the Co-ordinating Committee as part of their responsibilities in the formulation of measures for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection in the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is used mainly by students undertaking urban or <span class="highlight">environmental</span> studies courses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Justice Fox was the Presiding Commissioner of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry established by the previous Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Justice Fox, with his background and experience in this field- so well demonstrated by the breadth and quality of the reports of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry- has indicated that he is prepared to accept this task, a task which is most important for Australia and I venture to say for the wider international community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember that when I approached him in July 1975 to be the Presiding Commissioner of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry and urged upon him how seminal and crucial it was that such an inquiry should be for all <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues, particularly one which had such great national and international importance, he gave very careful consideration before accepting the Labor Government’s commission to conduct the Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia could not be better represented at these important international meetings than by  Mr Justice  Fox, who, I believe, already has secured the respect, indeed the admiration, of all sections of the Australian community and of many people overseas for the way that he conducted the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Progress has been made in the consideration of the technological and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of future minerals exploration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The full justification for what we have done in this area comes from the second report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) The areas involved are more particularly explained in paragraphs 1 and 4 of Chapter 16 of the Second Report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry, under the section headed ‘Proposed Strategy’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these possibilities may be accepted with equanimity by some people such as the zero population growth advocates, those who are sceptical of economic growth for its own sake, others who are concerned with conservation and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues and those who feel quite simply that the country needs time to adjust to the post-war influx of immigrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is regrettable that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters have been very low on this Government’s priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An example is the <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, which probably is one of the most important pieces of legislation ever introduced into this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They had wide ramifications and it is very interesting to note that although both reports were brought down during the last two years, no proposal has been referred to the <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act by the Fraser Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With regard to the mining of uranium, as I said earlier, both the first and second reports of the Ranger inquiry were brought down under the terms of the <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government is superficially concerned with <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and human justice issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will deal briefly with the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sad thing is that this Government is so superficial even with regard to the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> proposals put forward by the Ranger inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Ranger report argued very strongly against using the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act, both for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> reasons and reasons associated with civil liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It does not allow <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations to disturb its provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact legislation is irrelevant and has no force on uranium mining in the Alligator River region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has only a moral obligation, not a legal obligation, to recognise the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> safeguards recommended in the second Ranger report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other comments to be made on the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole basis of my criticism of this Bill is that on the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> front and the conservation front this Government has such very low priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of accepting the proposition, as reported, that there should be sequential development of uranium mining in the areas and that only the Ranger mine should go ahead first to ascertain what problems would be created in this delicate <span class="highlight">environmental</span> area- that would have been bad enough- the Government rejected it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, whilst not opposing the Bill, the Opposition criticises and in some cases condemns the priority given to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and conservation matters of protecting our national heritage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it is good to see in the Minister’s second reading speech- I compliment him on the fact- that the Government, through the Aus.tralian <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Council, will move positively towards comprehensive and co-ordinated regulations for the export and import of environmentally hazardous chemicals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although I do not regard the Bill as a major controversy for the House, I must say that quite consistent with the inability of the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  to sustain expenditure in other areas for which he is responsible, there has been this heavy decline in funding of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Alongside those who suffer the direct effects of collisions on the road are the more subtle effects of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, the present Government, as in so many other areas, has allowed the <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection Act to be watered down so that we now have the absurd situation in Victoria where in my own electorate in the City of Heidelberg in respect of the Bell Street-Banksia Street connection, the construction authority is carrying out its own impact studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are also the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> people, the fisheries people, the people who monitor oil spillage and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is perhaps unfortunate that the report has so little feeling for the social, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and industrial determinants of people’s health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Scullin  (Dr Jenkins),  who will second the amendment, will deal more fully with the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of replanting should be taken into consideration and be part of any agreement under which funds are made available for the purpose in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1974 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation inquired into the operation of the 1967 and 1972 Acts with particular reference, which I will mention in part, to their <span class="highlight">environmental</span>, social and economic impact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry in its Second Report on 17 May 1977 and the purchase of which was promised by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on 25 August 1977  (Hansard,  pages 650 and 667 J. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-75">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third factor which ought to be looked at in the light of our amendment is the question of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least in the previous Bills some attention was paid to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not exactly enlightening as far as <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the 1972 Act more note was taken of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The States shall ensure that planting during each year is carried out efficiently and in conformity with sound forestry and financial practices and shall ensure that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors relating to planting have been considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other very significant factor in this area is the question of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> hazards that arise from such plantings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I talk of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> hazards I am not referring only to the green issues, if you like- the sorts of things that relate to Australian flora and fauna and cause so much emotional reaction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things I should emphasise when referring to the recommendations of the Committee is that this Parliament in its program should not concentrate only on softwood programs but should be willing to consider a similar program for the regeneration of our natural hardwood areas in a way that would ensure the maintenance of forest diversity and a number of other <span class="highlight">environmental</span> values. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other point I am concerned about in this Bill is that no attention is paid to the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> hazards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in common with most of us who are single-minded in some sort of occupationI was nearly going to say we often cannot see the wood for the trees, but that would be almost a Freudian slip in this context- they lose the awareness of the concern that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> hazards can cause in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should seek to make certain that at all steps the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> concerns that are held in the community are observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that if honourable members read paragraph 159 of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation and in particular sub-paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) and clauses (a) to (1) they will see the common-sense approach of this all party Committee to the sort of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors that we should be talking about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think he was accurate when he said that the Government has paid no attention to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That report discusses rather extensively some of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues that we need to face with respect to softwoods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is for greater research to be conducted into the side effects of softwood forestry upon all the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues raised in the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like an opportunity to say that in my view the people employed in the Forestry Commission who manage the softwood plantations and the hardwood plantations in my electorate are the true conservationists who, in their dealings with both the softwood and the hardwood environment, have always been very careful in their management techniques to take account of any <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors that they find could be detrimental. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insufficient research is being conducted into the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> hazards connected with the plantation of large areas of exotic trees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Insufficient research is being conducted into the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> hazards connected with the plantation of large areas of exotic trees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a role to be played in the softwood planting program by private forestry interests provided they are subject to the same <span class="highlight">environmental</span> safeguards as State forest services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediate consideration should be given to providing financial assistance to the States for the regeneration of hardwood areas in a way that ensures the maintenance of forest diversity and other <span class="highlight">environmental</span> values. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that wood-chipping operations or other operations involving clear-felling of large areas be discontinued until the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects are better known and properly assessed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is most desirable from an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> point of view and from a resources point of view that we should replant this area with softwood timber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the amendment from an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> point of view, as I have said, because it puts pressure on forestry organisations to purchase timbered land instead of cleared land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much has been said about the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues in regard to the forestry industry in general in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who talks about <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impacts should consider that aspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Fundamentally, the inquiry was designed to provide a basis on which the Government could take responsible decisions for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A commission was appointed to inquire, and I quote from its terms of reference:  in respect of all the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The second report contained recommendations on measures to ensure that the necessary degree of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection was provided over the full period of uranium mining developments in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To adopt strict <span class="highlight">environmental</span> controls and standards in relation to uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to refer to the main clauses of this Bill, which, I am sure honourable members will agree, is a very significant piece of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, honourable members will appreciate the scope of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection measures, in a geographic context, by reference to the schedule attached to the Bill, which is in effect a copy of map 3 from the second report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will consider and recommend programs for the collection of data, consider and keep under review standards, practices, procedures and measures for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection and restoration and keep under review requirements and their implementation under prescribed instruments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I expect that membership of the Co-ordinating Committee will include representatives of Commonwealth and Territory government agencies involved in the research, monitoring and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection programs, the Northern Land Council and the mining companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will be pleased to know that under the direction of  Mr Robert  Fry, who has been seconded from the Australian Atomic Energy Commission to the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development to undertake preliminary functions of the proposed Supervising Scientist, steps have already been taken to establish monitoring of base-line <span class="highlight">environmental</span> conditions in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using temporary field laboratories, a significant amount of work has already been undertaken to establish a data base for later development of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Ranger uranium <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry recognised the intrinsic value of the region, and central to its recommendations was the establishment of a major national park to safeguard these assets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The management plan prepared by the Director and approved by Parliament will ensure <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection, and that appropriate management practices are employed, taking into account the interests of the traditional Aborigines owners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every care will be taken to minimise <span class="highlight">environmental</span> disturbance during the exploration phase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill is intended to give effect to the Government’s decisions on the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry as far as they affect Aboriginal land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The inquiry was concerned to ensure that the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Northern Land Council should be able to reinforce the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection machinery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">environmental</span> conditions which each mining company in the region will be required to observe will provide for consistency with the relevant codes as they are promulgated, where comparable or more stringent requirements do not already exist in the conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is responsible <span class="highlight">environmental</span> legislation that will provide for the development of protection measures in respect to nuclear activities in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry saw the Director of National Parks and Wildlife and the Northern Land Council as having a special interest in reinforcing the environment protection machinery in the Alligator Rivers region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It confers jurisdiction on the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, at the suit of the Director of National Parks and Wildlife or the Northern Land Council, to make orders for the enforcement, in relation to uranium mining, of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> requirements which are contained in Commonwealth and Northern Territory laws and in instruments made under those laws, and it gives the Court a wide discretion as to the exercise of this jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be noted that the Bill does not give the Court power to impose new <span class="highlight">environmental</span> requirementsonly to make orders in relation to requirements which are imposed elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The six Bills just introduced underline our determination to proceed with uranium development in a carefully-regulated and responsible fashion with full regard for proper <span class="highlight">environmental</span> control and for ensuring the welfare of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actual individuals to be members of the Uranium Advisory Council have not yet been settled, but the Government has agreed that the Council should include representation from the following groups: The Austraiian religious community; the Aboriginal community; a national voluntary <span class="highlight">environmental</span> organisation; the Northern Territory community; the Australian Council of Trade Unions; a person with experience in energy matters; the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that last August the then Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development stated that strict <span class="highlight">environmental</span> controls and standards in relation to uranium mining would be adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard the Government is presently examining the nature of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> requirements, consistent with the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> controls agreed on by the Government last August, that would be included in the grant of a mining authority to the Ranger consortium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In accordance with the administrative procedures under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, Pancontinental Mining Ltd and Queensland Mines Ltd have prepared draft <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements on the development of the Jabiluka and Nabarlek deposits respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Western Mining Corporation also made available for public comment a draft <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement on its research plant at Kalgoorlie proposed in connection with the Yeelirrie deposit in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to meeting Aboriginal interests in the area and the necessary <span class="highlight">environmental</span> controls, the Government will be proceeding with a tightly controlled exploration program so that the resources of the stage 2 area can be identified and appropriate action taken as quickly as possible to enable the proclamation of the area as a national park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have set ourselves a policy of carefully regulated and controlled development, paying due regard to proper <span class="highlight">environmental</span> control and ensuring the welfare of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one goes through the list one sees mentioned the Australian religious community, the Aboriginal community, a national voluntary <span class="highlight">environmental</span> organisation, the Northern Territory community, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, a person with experience in energy matters, the Australian uranium industry, a nuclear scientist, a medical practitioner or health physicist, an environmentalist with experience in natural resource development, an economist with experience in natural resource development, an expert in national and international affairs or law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Given the fall away of growth in the gross national product in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, as well as the problems of siting nuclear power stations and the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> backlash against them, it is very likely that those projections will not be met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The area is in a band roughly 10 to 30 kilometres from Melbourne’s centre, but psychologically and environmentally it is as far from Melbourne as Ballarat or Bendigo, with a deepseated sense of social isolation which will be difficult to overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has not supported the Rathburnie <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Education Estate at Linville in the Brisbane Valley, however, under the States Grants (Soil Conservation) Act 1974 and the Environment (Financial Assistance) Act 1977 the following projects aimed at demonstrating the long-term commercial viability of land and environment conservation practices have been supported: demonstration catchment, Pisant Creek, South Australia demonstration project- pitting of denuded pastoral and marginal land, South Australia demonstration erosion and reclamation control project in cereal growing districts of Western Australia demonstration of a method of sand-trapping and dune rebuilding, Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This must be intensely painful, for the baby of this age has already developed a real sensitivity to touch and pain over the whole of its body, and it writhes about in the uterus during the pickling, trying to escape its deadly <span class="highlight">environmental</span> pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All proposals are to be supported by information required to determine, firstly, the economic and social value of the proposal; secondly, the relevance of the proposal to overall urban transport objectives and policies; thirdly, the relevance of the proposal to urban development policies; and finally, the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact of the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the major debates on the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> legislation regarding uranium mining in the Northern Territory in respect of which six Bills will come before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To undertake any substantial amount of construction work on the Ranger project or to bring a substantial number of workers into the Ranger area without agreement would appear to be contrary to the recommendation of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry Report referred to by the honourable member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The recommendations of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry, to which the honourable member referred, do not mean that any developmental work could not proceed at Jabiru prior to the implementation of the recommendations in question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government will do everything in its power to ensure that the Ranger project is developed as quickly as possible subject to meeting the necessary constraints, social and <span class="highlight">environmental</span>, and protecting Aboriginal interests in accordance with the Government’s statements in Parliament on 25 August last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-The introduction of the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill 1978 demonstrates in the clearest possible way that the Government has failed to take seriously the criticisms of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry of the use of the Atomic Energy Act as a vehicle for the commercial development of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The crucial section of the Memorandum provides that contracts giving it effect ‘shall not become effective until Australia has affirmed them following consideration of: (a) the report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry; (b) a report by the Interim Aboriginal Land Commissioner in any claims by Aboriginals in respect of land within the Ranger Project area’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, there could be a real or apparent conflict of interest between the entrepreneurial role of the Atomic Energy Commission and its responsibilities under the Act to supervise local <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment, however, there are only shaky grounds to suggest that an independent Council will be able to offset the Atomic Energy Act’s potential for preventing adequate public scrutiny of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> standards at Ranger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed the appointment of an Atomic Energy Commission scientist to set up the office of supervising scientist responsible for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> research and monitoring hardly inspires confidence in the Government’s sensitivity to the need for unimpeachable information and judgments on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> controls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government chooses simply to ignore the independent, well-informed judgments of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a failure on the part of honourable members opposite to see that the Australian will that is implied in the series of Bills coming before the House is recognised by the rest of the world and recognised in such a way that many other countries will take up our safeguards and our <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I quote part of the third finding of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry, which appears at page 185 of its first report: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since then we have had the benefit of much information from Australia and overseas, particularly that contained in the report of the Ranger <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Governor-General in his Speech when opening the Parliament this year mentioned that the Government would be proceeding with the development and export of Australia’s uranium resources in a carefully regulated and responsible fashion with full regard for the population, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> control and the welfare of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time the amending measure protects mining interests from disclosure of incriminating material which concerns <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill is, of course, linked with the numbers of important Bills designed to give effect to the implementation of the second Fox report, the proper name of that report being the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Reference was made by the honourable member for Cunningham  (Mr West)  to the specific provisions that I have mentioned briefly relating to the provision of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> information and also the inspection rights that the Northern Land Council will enjoy as a result of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These three Bills- the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill amending the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 and the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill- are based on recommendations of the second Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry, better known as the second Fox report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fairness to the Government, I state that I recognise that there will be much greater <span class="highlight">environmental</span> control over mining in the Alligator <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We in this Parliament have a responsibility to Australia and the rest of the world to develop our uranium resources as speedily as possible, subject, of course, to essential safeguard provisions, reasonable <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and safety considerations and the rights and interests of the Aboriginal and other inhabitants of the areas where the reserves are located. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill the Director of National Parks and Wildlife is given enormous power, not only in relation to national park management and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> considerations but also in relation to the development of uranium mining and milling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst the three Bills are truly <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and deal with different aspects, it seems to me that the content of the two groups I mentioned is somewhat different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, which deals with the Alligator Rivers region and the setting up of a scientific structure to monitor events, contains certain deficiencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is not truly known what the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects may be, we may face a situation where, put under test, it will be shown that in the middle of the national park mining should not take place at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Admittedly, the report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry recommended that the national park be created under a Federal Act but, at the time that report was prepared, moves towards self-government for the Territory were only beginning to gain momentum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill envisages that the national Director will have a central role in the protection of the environment and in the enforcement of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> controls, whether relating to uranium mining or not, in the area comprised in the national park or in any conservation zone, pending the extension of the national park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It also happens to be a fact that in my own State, whatever its imperfections, there is environment protection legislation on the statute book that goes further than anything the Government has contemplated in this legislation, and indeed further than any <span class="highlight">environmental</span> Commonwealth statute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No State government, having regard to its own background knowledge and experience in the handling of industrial affairs and industrial and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> legislation, where some States are well ahead of the Commonwealth, should be prepared to accept that sort of treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It follows, does it not, that there would be many people wanting to test the issue of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> control and all the other matters as here defined concerned with uranium mining operations, yet the jurisdiction is being limited to the suit of the Director or of a land council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is extraordinary that when an anti-miner decision is involved the State Labor Government will oppose a report by a judge, even though that opposition is against the best interests of the mining companies and the miners themselves; yet when there is a decision that would be to the benefit of the mining industry, that is, the location of a coal loader at Botany Bay, the State Labor Government hides behind an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> report which, quite frankly, is very poor indeed in quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has shown that it will sit back and let the States fight amongst each other for development in the absence of strong national guidelines for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Chairman, what members of the Opposition have said in this debate- it is their allegations that I am answering- is that the States are entirely incompetent to have any influence over the code relating to the uranium <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection that we are debating tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Chairman, I will go directly to the clauses we are debating and point out the fact that the codes which are the subject of the amendments are part of our obligation under international agreements that presently exist and which this Government will be proposing in forums to see that there is a universal approach to safeguards and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> standards which will apply to the mining of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments and this code which the Government has come up with after a great deal of consideration after receiving the report of the Fox inquiry are specifically designed to provide that level and degree of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection which is absolutely basic to the mining and treatment of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the States already have codes that cover this kind of legislation; that they did not need this <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection Act in the first place; they could have drawn it up without us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The concept of participation within the International Whaling Commission, therefore, of representatives both from the whaling industry, on the one hand, and from <span class="highlight">environmental</span> groups on the other, is designed to try to ensure that there should be an adequate opportunity for consideration of the Australian point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been brought to my attention that the representative to be sent on behalf of Project Jonah, the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> group concerned, is in fact neither an Australian citizen nor an Australian resident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In accordance with the recommendations of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry, the Government had delayed issue of any formal authorities to mine until other recommendations concerning the grant of Aboriginal land and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection mechanisms have been implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Analysis of all relevant records, including exposure incidents, sickness absence, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and biological monitoring data and previous work history, subject to a statement first being issued to AAEC staff (by the Commission with the support of the Labor Council), that: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That policy was based on the findings and recommendations of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry conducted under the Honourable  Mr Justice  Fox as Presiding Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our policy was decided only after most careful consideration of the report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The development of those resources, while serving the objectives just mentioned, must also be regulated and controlled so as to ensure full protection of the environment and the welfare of the Aboriginal people, and yield the economic benefits to Australia and its people that were described in the report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s approval for the export of uranium from a particular project will be given only after full consideration by the Government following the completion of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> procedures and compliance with the Government’s foreign investment policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The machinery and the procedures I have just outlined will ensure that the Government maintains strong regulation and control over uranium exports in the national interest in a manner consistent with the Government’s policy of uranium development announced on 25 August 1 977 following receipt of the report of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although looking to the eventual development of the Jabiluka uranium deposit, the Government is nevertheless committed to not making a final decision on whether the Jabiluka project should proceed until the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects of the project, both physical and social, is satisfied . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This development strategy seems particularly appropriate in the Region as it should also minimise adverse <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The decisions in relation to nuclear codes in particular and also the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> standards to be set will be made by the States and not by the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Blaxland also raised the question of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problem in the area in which this uranium mining is to be carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recommendations have also been made in a number of other areas relating to helmets and visors; applicability of road rules to riders and cyclists as well as their training and licensing; other road and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors; and safety related publicity campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The understanding that I have of the Western Mining project at Yeelirrie is that the company is at the moment seeking <span class="highlight">environmental</span> approval to put in a research plant to test the feasibility of a uranium mining operation at Yeelirrie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there is no substance whatsoever in statements that Yeelirrie is likely to come in before the Ranger project and it is quite wrong to make statements that that project can go ahead without the satisfactory <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements that are required before any uranium project is approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently the Australian Environment Council, with the strong support of the Commonwealth Government, decided to establish a National Advisory Committee on Chemicals to assess the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects of a wide range of substances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-39-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Ranger uranium <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry pointed out, Aborigines have never before been confronted with such important matters requiring a knowledge of a negotiating system utterly foreign to their traditional methods of consultation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This important matter, which is essentially one of longterm <span class="highlight">environmental</span> management, has become confused and distorted by several unfounded allegations, in particular that an unexploded nuclear weapon is buried at Maralinga; that radioactive waste was brought from British nuclear power stations and buried at Maralinga; and that about 800 tonnes of nuclear waste material, including plutonium, is buried at Maralinga, which is what the South Australian Minister for Mines and Energy was reported on 20 December 1976 to have said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The forthcoming <span class="highlight">environmental</span> survey should add further data assisting governmental decisions about the continuing secure management of the material at Maralinga. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The principal recommendation of that report was that the Government should undertake a further detailed study of all ecological and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors associated with the burial of material at Maralinga. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From the standpoint of long-term <span class="highlight">environmental</span> management the most important of the extensive facts recorded in the report relate to the burial of some 20 kilograms of plutonium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was also decided subsequently to join the Emu Field area to this study because the proximity of Maralinga and Emu Field suggested that the same, or similar, long-range <span class="highlight">environmental</span> management measures should apply to both. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that it will not be necessary to invoke the national interest provisions of this Bill, and that with goodwill from all parties- the Aboriginal landowners, the prospective miners, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> interests and the Government- a reasonable and effective solution can in most cases be found to protect the Aboriginal interests and to meet desirable national development goals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia is not well prepared to cope with a major pollution incident, yet ship-sourced oil pollution, accidental or deliberate, is already a major <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problem and the Committee believes that as Australia’s reliance on imported oil products increases so will the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact of marine oil pollution is difficult to predict not only because our knowledge of marine ecology is imperfect but also because there are no effective means of evaluating the physical factors which affect an oil spill such as tidal and wind movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The inquiry has resulted in the co-operation of a large number of people, not only the staff of the Committee who, of course, have given their usual excellent service, but also representatives of industry and other interested people who, I believe, have made a genuine attempt to improve the safety and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> precautions within the industry generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its creation was seen as essential to the overall strategy for minimising adverse social and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impacts which might occur with the onset of mining in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is within this context that I wish to draw honourable members’ attention to the arrangement that the Government has made for detailed <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">environmental</span> requirements for Ranger, which reflect fully the recommendations of the Ranger uranium <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry, are a condition of the authority to mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say that all of these <span class="highlight">environmental</span> requirements were the subject of quite detailed consideration and discussions during the Government’s negotiations with the Northern Land Council, and the Council did indicate its satisfaction with them knowing, of course, that precise standards are to be applied before mining and milling commences, and after adequate research has been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will ensure that co-operatively, the Commonwealth and the Territory can implement the strict <span class="highlight">environmental</span> requirements recommended by the Ranger inquiry, and agreed on by the Government in its uranium decision of August 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I wish to announce that the Government proposes to introduce a levy as a recognition of the special costs of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> monitoring and research activities related to uranium mining in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the Supervising Scientist and the research institute will be carrying out <span class="highlight">environmental</span> monitoring and research activities specially designed for regulation of uranium mining, the Government has decided that an appropriate levy should be paid by the uranium miners concerned in recognition of the special <span class="highlight">environmental</span> costs involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all, I believe that the Government, through these legislative and administrative arrangements, and the land use controls to be enforced through the national park procedures has established new and significant standards for resource management and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection, and that the opportunity is provided for a completely satisfactory reconciliation of the various interests in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and aesthetic aspects of road planning are generally taken into account although I fear that many transport planners do not take account of the social and community factors in road works and planning, particularly in the laying of major roads and freeways through communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Especially those of us who are often worried by the shrill prophecies of gloom from some of the environmentalists, such as the obviously biased Australian Conservation Foundation, would appreciate some scientific and hopefully unbiased comments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Ranger inquiry specifically recommended that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> controls be regularly reviewed and strengthened if necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, for example, it becomes clear in the future that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> restrictions imposed on the Ranger operation by virtue of its authority to mine are too weak, then this legislation would prevent the Government of the day from updating the conditions attached to rnining, despite that newly acquired knowledge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All parties to the proposed Ranger and possible Pancontinental Mining Ltd mining operations, for example, acknowledge that comprehensive baseline <span class="highlight">environmental</span> data has still not been collected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that would be required would be the development of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems unrecognised or ignored at the time of granting an authority to mine, or, alternatively, the development of a greater <span class="highlight">environmental</span> awareness than existed at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill also prevents the addition of new <span class="highlight">environmental</span> safeguards to the authority to mine unless current conditions are not adhered to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Of course, the most troublesome <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problem associated with uranium is the need to dispose safely and securely of the large quantities of radioactive waste generated by the use of uranium in nuclear reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of this legislation is that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> conditions placed on uranium which would take this problem into account, conditions which would place some of the responsibility for this problem and its pollution on the beneficiaries of mining, conditions which could be used to influence the use or choice of particular waste disposal technologies, could not be added by a future government without further amendment to the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Has his attention been drawn to a statement in the August 1978 newsletter of the Environment Council of the Northern Territory that there were 9 public responses to the draft <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement of Pancontinental Mining Ltd for the extension of the Arnhem Highway, but a response prepared in a Government department was suppressed by a higher authority in that department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-50-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The nine public comments received on the draft <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement for the Arnhem Highway extension were summarised in the final impact statement which was made available to the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-50-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister will also be aware of increasing pressure from mining companies to water down measures for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection and the preservation of the Australian heritage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The principles of the Heritage Commission are of great importance to Australia and this Government will maintain those principles to the fullest; but at the same time there are some elements of the Heritage Commission Act, as originally passed, which do come into conflict with other Acts and which could even stand in the way of matters which have been under full <span class="highlight">environmental</span> examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, there was a possibility of one point of conflict as a result of the Heritage Commission Act involving matters that had been the subject of  Mr Justice  Fox’s <span class="highlight">environmental</span> reports and it does not seem to make much sense to have the possibility of conflict of that kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first action I have decided upon is to seek from the United States the information upon which the United States <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection Agency based its decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In making this decision, the Government has taken full account of the recommendations made by the Minister for Science and the Environment  (Senator Webster)  in relation to the final <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement submitted by <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is satisfied that the legislative controls which we introduced in April 1978 regulating uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers Region, in conjunction with the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> requirements which will be imposed on the company, together with the controls negotiated and agreed between the Northern Land Council and Queensland Mines Ltd, will ensure that any adverse impact on the local Aboriginal population will be minimised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In relation to the Yeelirrie deposit in Western Australia, the Minister for Science and the Environment advised me recently that there are no objections on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> grounds to that project subject to satisfactory arrangements being made with the Western Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my statement to Parliament on 25 August 1977 I said that the Commonwealth Government would take decisions on the development of projects such as Yeelirrie subject to satisfactory completion of the necessary <span class="highlight">environmental</span> requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As to the Jabiluka and Koongarra deposits in the Alligator Rivers Region, the companies involved, Pancontinental Mining Ltd and Noranda Australia Ltd, have submitted draft <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the policy of this Government to establish uranium mining and marketing on the basis of the recommendations of the Ranger uranium <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are basic <span class="highlight">environmental</span> concerns as well as concerns related to the orderly development of the Northern Territory economy and infrastructure dictating the wisdom of sequential development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a foolish policy even on a commercial basis alone, without any <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is a good thing to gain a wide understanding of the necessary <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection measures in which public spirited companies are now involving themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In some States the main responsibility associated with vehicle emissions is exercised by <span class="highlight">environmental</span> authorities while in other States the transport authorities exercise the responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is imperative that the Federal and State governments adopt a national energy conservation policy with a balance between <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and fuel economy requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If common sense prevails ADR27A will be reviewed by the motor industry and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> interests as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the research will be carried out in close co-operation with the Northern Territory Department of Health, which will take into account other surveys and evaluations aimed at assessing different methods of improving <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors in health and methods of health care delivery and administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-49-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee found that the low standard of health apparent in the majority of Aboriginal communities can be attributed largely to the unsatisfactory <span class="highlight">environmental</span> conditions in which Aboriginals live; to their low socioeconomic status in the Australian community; and to the failure of health authorities to give sufficient attention to the special health needs of Aboriginals and to take proper account of their social and cultural beliefs and practices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I stress that as far as the major <span class="highlight">environmental</span> health problem is concerned, this Government has a major responsibility to regard this problem in the way indicated by the  Chairman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The World Health Organisation, along with many other authorities and most people who have studied the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems of deprived communities, particularly indigenous minorities, has said that it is essential that those communities determine their health care priorities and take a major part in planning and decision-making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As distinct from that we have a committee of the Australian Environment Council- Vehicle Emissions and Noise Standards Advisory Committee- which places far more emphasis on the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of exhaust emissions and which in turn tries to make sure that some of the figures and some of the information produced by the Committee on Motor Vehicle Emissions are perhaps wrong or deficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The following Government Departments have procedures concerned with monitoring or controlling the importation into Australia of equipment, technology, chemical or pharmaceutical preparations or formulations which may be hazardous from the points of view of safety, health and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Question 1- Section 62 and 63 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 and the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations made under the Customs Act provide a means by which controls are exercised by this Department over the supply and importation of goods which may be hazardous from the points of view of safety, health and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example it is as improper as using federal export powers to impose <span class="highlight">environmental</span> restraints on States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some criticism could be levelled on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors at both the Federal and State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this particular matter one thing that I would like to express is the surprise at the general lack of interest in this type of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear that concern for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters is well down the drain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>We find some comments there that indicate that all forms of development are being questioned as to their <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Environmentally and economically it is not necessarily wide enough in its scope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That may be good economic and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am disturbed at this loss of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> interest, particularly in the forest area which cover such a wide scope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In referring to the report I would remind honourable members that it recommended that immediate consideration should be given to providing financial assistance to the States for the regeneration of hardwood areas in a way that would ensure the maintenance of forest diversity and other <span class="highlight">environmental</span> values. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that we will be able to progress to a situation where we take more notice of the forest diversity and the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I utter the warning that there will be need for further biological survey and constant <span class="highlight">environmental</span> monitoring if the program is to be properly successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My criticism of this Bill has been based mainly on its restrictive <span class="highlight">environmental</span> nature and, further, on the rather niggardly attitude of the States concerning the period of repayment of the amount involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am concerned at this loss of feeling for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> values. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is involved is knowledge of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters and an examination of our marvellous resources, such as timber, a material that is so much a part of our every day life and is so useful in all that we do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I notice that the honourable member for Scullin  (Dr Jenkins)  in his speech pointed out the proper connection between softwoods and hardwoods as an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspect which must be noted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects of this Bill are all important to the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the original 1967 agreement- as was pointed out by the honourable member for Scullin  (Dr Jenkins)  who is occupying the Chair at this time- and with the rise in general community concern about the ecological and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact of forestry several major investigations have been made into forestry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although forestry is essentially a State issue, this Parliament has a role, financially, and a responsibility, economically and environmentally, to enlarge the forestry debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In strictly <span class="highlight">environmental</span> terms, one should not let the occasion pass without reference to the two most heated disputes at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Science and the Environment whether it is a fact that the Government is in the process of reviewing each of the existing Commonwealth Acts covering <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it the intention of the Government, following the completion of these secret reviews, to instruct the Minister to introduce amending legislation to each of the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection Acts with the intention of weakening the existing legislation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no secret that the Government has for some time been reviewing the principal <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection legislation in order to spell out properly the role of the States in supervising the protection of the environment in Australia, to ensure that overlapping and possible duplication of effort is avoided so that expense incurred by companies and people involved is kept to a minimum and io make the Act generally more efficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Fox reportits correct name is the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry report, as I mentioned earlierrecommended against the use ofthe Atomic Energy Act to grant authority to Ranger to mine uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That decision is contrary to the express findings and recommendations of the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was said by Stephen Zorn, one of the major consultants in these negotiations for the Northern Land Council, that one of the reasons he was prepared to accede to what he described as miserably low royalties was that he had managed to have written into the Ranger agreement considerable amounts to be provided for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection, which he estimated would bring the total to something like 9  ‘A  per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection is not just for Aborigines and the royalties paid will still be far short of some of those paid in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The prospect is that, if the Government were permitted to proceed with its plans on such a basis, we could find ourselves so substantially committed to uranium exports a decade from now that we would be a desperate seller rather than a seller concerned, as we should be, about the safety, <span class="highlight">environmental</span>, weapons proliferation and waste disposal problems of nuclear energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The harsh facts are that, firstly, the Government is continuing to do no more than mouth its commitment to selective elements of the proposals in the Fox report; secondly, the Government has not kept abreast of, and has not informed the Parliament of the pace of international developments concerning nonproliferation; and thirdly, the Government is pursuing a policy which is dangerous in terms of economic investment, political, social and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences and national security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In response to a request from the Office of the Supervising Scientist, 19 CSIRO officers participated in a Workshop on <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Programs in the Alligator River Region which was held at Jabiru from 21-25 August 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequent to the Workshop, the Division of Entomology is advising the Supervising Scientist on insect problems at the Jabiru townsite and is carrying out an exploratory study into the use of insects for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> monitoring in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time, other Divisions are discussing with the Supervising Scientist what further assistance CSIRO might provide and additional <span class="highlight">environmental</span> projects are likely to be commenced when the present program of appointing technical staff to the Office has been completed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, I present the report of the Committee entitled ‘<span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection, Adequacy of Legislative and Administrative Arrangements, First Report’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Originally, the Committee had hoped to examine the overall needs for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Act is to ensure that those responsible for developing proposals and those responsible for taking decisions on those proposals think about and take account of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could be applied to areas not suitable to the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement technique. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is considerable potential for overlap between the Commonwealth and the States in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The objectives of these arrangements are to ensure co-ordination of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessment and to avoid duplication of State and Commonwealth requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the attitudes of the various States to Commonwealth involvement in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection varies, all State Governments, except Queensland, stated that the arrangements are working well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee recognises the responsibility of the States in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection and believes that the Act should be amended to acknowledge the States’ role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report emphasises that there is a need for the Commonwealth to maintain powers that would enable it to intervene in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters of national concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One requires the Minister to give reasons for not directing an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement and the other recommends an amendment to the Act to allow for round-table discussions between interested parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we received evidence from some of the mining companies- they put the view forward that all <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters ought to be the responsibility of the States- I think we were all suspicious of the fact that their enthusiasm for ending Commonwealth involvement in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters was because one or two of the States in particular seemed to give the Australian mining companies almost a totally free go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They emphasise the intent of the Committee that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and conservation considerations be discussed openly and without the privacy of government inquiries and government departmental actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>12 states that the Minister should provide details of the reasons why a direction on an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement on particular proposals is not given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I get a little tired of those who seek to use the ACF as a whipping-boy for anti-conservation and anti-<span class="highlight">environmental</span> outbursts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were pressures on the Government, particularly from the Australian Mining Industry Council and its affiliates, for quite drastic changes in relation to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Committee received considerable evidence from the Mining Industry Council, the Council and its various State affiliates were not able to come up with a single example of a major mining project in Australia that has failed to go ahead because of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> legislation, except for Fraser Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not sure whether that reflects well on governments, environmentalists or what, but the reality is that despite all the evidence we received it did not appear to us that the Mining Industry Council really had a substantial case for major changes in legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We received evidence and were aware of the fact that in Australia at the present time a number of major projects which are of very great <span class="highlight">environmental</span> significance are being developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Government will fully take the report into consideration before it makes any decisions in relation to changes to <span class="highlight">environmental</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will make few comments on the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act except to say that the Committee fully recognises the role of the State governments and their <span class="highlight">environmental</span> responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it also recognises the contribution that this Act has had in developing industry awareness, government awareness at the three levels of government and a public awareness of this nation’s resources and the need for their exploitation under conditions that ensure adequate <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commonwealth involvement in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection be restricted to geographic areas under the direct control of the Commonwealth (e.g., Commonwealth Territories), Commonwealth works and activities, activities which the States have referred to the Commonwealth and matters considered by the Commonwealth Government to be of national significance-, <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I believe that local government and the State governments today have a much greater awareness of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues than they had a few years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>R;/ BAILLIEU (La Trobe)-by leave-Being a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, I appreciate the opportunity of having a couple of minutes in which to make some comments on the Committee’s report and its inquiry into the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection legislation of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the point which has to be borne in mind and which came through in the course of the hearings and the investigations that the Committee made was that the whole question of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection is not the sole province of any one tier of government in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I think the report acknowledges that the Federal Government has an enormous responsibility in the area of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection, and it must be borne in mind that the whole question of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection is probably one of the main responsibilities of any elected representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it also has to be borne in mind that whereas the Federal legislation for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection refers primarily to the impact proposals, it is the State governments and local authorities which have the on-going responsibility to administer and to monitor any development that is approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be remembered that the whole question of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection does not finish after there has been an inquiry, under the auspices of either this Act or any State legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a general rule Commonwealth involvement in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection be restricted to geographic areas under the direct control of the Commonwealth (e.g. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope this report will be read by people who take an interest in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters, particularly some of the people who came before the Committee with what I might call some of the more far-out evidence that was brought to our attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For many years they have been extremely isolated because of the poor <span class="highlight">environmental</span> circumstances for radio communications down to the bases in Antarctica. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer, firstly, to the comments of  Mr Geoff  Duncan on the Australian Broadcasting Commission program  AM  in which he concluded a report on Treasury documents concerning <span class="highlight">environmental</span> legislation with, according to the transcript, the following words: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection Act- preferring a behind-the-scenes manoeuvre to get its views across. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The authors of those two reports are presumably referring to several sentences in the published report of the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation entitled ‘<span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection: Adequacy of Legislative and Administrative Arrangements’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee wrote to the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  on 21 February, inviting a submission from his Department on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> legislative arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 21 February 1979 the  Chairman  of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation the honourable member for Petrie  (Mr Hodges)  wrote to the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  inviting a submission from the Department of the Treasury in relation to the Committee’s inquiry into <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection- Adequacy of Legislative and Administrative Arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has been made obvious during the past week that the key department of the Government that is concerned with economic planning and the assessment of major projects infrastructure could not give a fig for the social, <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and broader implications of economic policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony)  is leading a Cabinet vendetta against <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who have read the documents could have come to the conclusion only that the Commonwealth was preparing to water down <span class="highlight">environmental</span> controls and hand over virtually all its responsibilities in this field to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a statement that was typical of the deception, deceit and doubletalk that has highlighted the term of office of the Fraser Government, he said in the next breath that all that was going to happen was that the Government would hand over to the States the responsibility for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> matters- that is, all those projects for which the Federal Government has no direct responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation in its report and the Minister for Science and the Environment  (Senator Webster)  in his memorandum of 11 June, have stated that only one State, Victoria, has comprehensive <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Prime Minister has stated that he would like to have <span class="highlight">environmental</span> laws more simply administered than they are at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday morning’s Melbourne  Age  observed that even if there is foreign investment in the Rundle oil shale deposit, the project is likely to escape an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> study. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, amendments foreshadowed by the Deputy Prime Minister would give responsibility for safeguarding the environment to that great environmentalist, the Queensland Minister for Mines and Energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland virtually obliterated what <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection it had last March by leaving individual departments free to make their own requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new procedures do not include public participation and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Victoria is the only State which has comprehensive <span class="highlight">environmental</span> legislation although legislation is currently before the New South Wales Parliament and is in the process of being drafted in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth should encourage those States without <span class="highlight">environmental</span> legislation to adopt legislation similar to the Impact of Proposals Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It therefore must carry out a crusade to gain exemption from the <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as its Minister has a blinkered approach to government, so too is the Treasury blinded to the long term social and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consequences of its policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He proposed to take <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessment out of the public domain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The change would facilitate the ability of the Environment Minister to take action to conclude his <span class="highlight">environmental</span> consideration of many proposals without having to resort to directing an impact statement and subjecting the matter concerned to public review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we will ensure in development projects, which are likely to have a significant and/or damaging effect on the environment and involving the Commonwealth, that <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Impact Statements are prepared prior to decisions having been made . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems ridiculous that the Minister should seek to change the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act so that no impact statement need be prepared, since in the past financial year only two <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements have been ordered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1976-77 and in 1977-78, 34 <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements were ordered by the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1975, 3,230 proposals regarded as environmentally significant have been put forward, but only 50 of those proposals have needed <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements to be prepared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Standing Committee recommended:  the <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act be amended to require the Minister for Science and the Environment to provide, on request, details of the reasons for not directing an <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Impact Statement on particular proposals considered to be of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the Committee feels that a reversal of the trend away from <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement assessment is in order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does anyone suggest that the whole nation should not be concerned at the possible <span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects of uranium mining at Roxby Downs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act is a model for the States to follow in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that the Government has not stated an intention to absolve itself from the area of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has a record second to none in the area of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government has made achievements in the area of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection- not just nonsense, not just scatter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trouble is that when his party was in power it achieved nothing in the area of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He- said that the Labor Party set up an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry into the mining of uranium at Ranger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government put the taxpayers of Australia in hock to the extent of hundreds of millions of dollars to finance the Ranger uranium venture, yet the honourable member for Robertson has the hide to come in here and say: ‘We were very sensitive to the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues of uranium mining.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Labor Party should not come in here and talk about the number of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessment statements that were made by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I interjected and said that those very same proposals had <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessments prepared on them by the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is considerable potential for overlap between the Commonwealth and the States in <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act also requires <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statements to be prepared in respect of developments outside Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What Australian Government or political party would have the pretence to suggest that it should make an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact assessment into development proposals in a foreign country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a question of walking away from <span class="highlight">environmental</span> issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can honourable members imagine the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact of that sort of situation on the women and children in the Yarrabah community- with guard dogs, police in uniform, gaol-like conditions and visiting magistrates? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could only be because of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors I have outlined and the fact that an oppressive sort of superior group is going to control their destiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is something which does not provide any <span class="highlight">environmental</span> risk or waste hazard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> constraints on transport systems, long not understood, are now being seen increasingly to be critically important limiting factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to take into account <span class="highlight">environmental</span> aspects, social and developmental factors- such as the need to service areas on other than economic groundsfrequency and reliability of services, safety, quality and comfort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Army recently completed an exercise in the area, which is now the subject of an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> study. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first corrects a simple error in the calculation of the size of the Ranger project area subsequent to the adjustment to the southern boundary in accordance with the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry recommendation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things that goes with the pipeline construction is an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact study. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He announced that the Young to Wagga Wagga natural gas pipeline would become the subject of an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement and that once this was available public comment would be invited on the draft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it needs to be said that the record in an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> sense of the Pipeline Authority has been a very good one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Photographs in the sixth report of the Pipeline Authority show in graphic detail that the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact of the laying of the pipeline is virtually negligible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that no problems of an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> nature will be associated with this project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Uranium Advisory Council inspected all <span class="highlight">environmental</span> reports and recommendations made by government and semi-government officials and authorities at every stage of uranium mining operations at Rum Jungle; if so, what recommendations has the Council made to ensure that there will be no repetition of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> damage which has occurred at any other site at which uranium mining proceeds; if not, will he refer the matter to the Council for a report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The operations at Rum Jungle reflected <span class="highlight">environmental</span> attitudes of 25 years ago which Australians would not tolerate today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s policy in respect of uranium development takes fully into account the need for <span class="highlight">environmental</span> protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Development approval for particular projects will only be given following, amongst other things, completion of the necessary <span class="highlight">environmental</span> requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have referred to the Council Pancontinental Mining Limited ‘s final <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact statement on the Jabiluka project together with the comments, suggestions and recommendations provided by the Minister for Science and the Environment under the Environment Protection Administrative Procedures of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. lt is my intention to do the same in respect of Noranda Australia Limited ‘s Koongarra project and of other proposals for uranium development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Can the Minister state what Federal and State government <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact assessments have been or will be carried out on proposed new aluminium smelters in the Hunter Valley, NSW. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I expect that any <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessment carried out of these proposals would be in co-operation with the New South Wales State <span class="highlight">environmental</span> authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All uranium mining operations in the Alligator Rivers Region are now subject to a large body of applicable laws and agreements relating to control of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and public health impact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are there any proposals to dispose of waste salt from current or proposed power stations in the Newcastle area, New South Wales (which use Lake Macquarie as a source of cooling water) in disused mine shafts in the Hunter Valley; if so, can the Minister state whether any Federal or New South Wales <span class="highlight">environmental</span> impact assessment of these proposals has been carried out or is planned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-58-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Department has not had referred to it the question of the disposal of waste salt from a proposed power station in the Newcastle area and no <span class="highlight">environmental</span> assessment has been undertaken or proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-58-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Australia the previous government decided on an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> inquiry before there was any further development of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>I refer to the Ranger Uranium <span class="highlight">Environmental</span> Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></li>
