    <p>Will he also consider abolishing the present practice of handing how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> cards to electors at the entrance to polling booths and in lieu thereof provide for the display of authorised how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> cards in every cubicle in every polling booth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to the list supplied to the Honourable Member on 24 September 1968, the latest available information indicates that the citizens of the following countries or provinces under the age of 21 years have been granted the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at elections: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-36-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can he state what further national, State or provincial legislatures have granted citizens the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> under the age of  21  years since his answer to me on  24  Sepember 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-36-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to satisfy himself whether a <span class="highlight">vote</span> was recorded prior to the close of the poll, a Divisional Returning Officer takes cognisance of the date added to the certificate by the Authorised Witness before whom the elector records his postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-36-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No member whose dues have been withheld by his employer for payment to such organisation pursuant to his voluntary authorisation provided for in a collective bargaining agreement shall be declared ineligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span> or be a candidate for office in such organisation by reason of alleged delay or default in the payment of dues’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he see any merit in the United States law which decrees that no union member whose dues have been withheld by his employer shall be declared ineligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span> or be a candidate for office by reason of alleged delay or default in the payment of dues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many of these Conventions did the Commonwealth support or <span class="highlight">vote</span> for at the International Labour Conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How did the Austraiian Government delegates <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the instruments adopted at the 54th (1969) Maritime Session of the International Labour Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If those 33 amendments were moved individually, seriatim, then from past experience I think it rather likely that we would have to have a closure motion on each of them, followed by a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the substantive issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Personally, I agree with the interpretation of the honourable member for Farrer; but that does not mean that I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment - the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of censure - put forward by the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition, as a matter of tactics, has moved a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of censure and has been loud in its demand foi State rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have no real sympathy with the States, (f this <span class="highlight">vote</span> of censure were carried, it might well lead to a further erosion of State powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this does not mean that I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Lalor  (Dr J. F. Cairns),  who has just sat down, thought fit to suggest that nobody knew how I proposed to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this censure motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never given any cause whatsoever for doubt as to how 1 propose to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this or any other motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition does not propose to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, if he thinks it necessary to make that clear by an amendment we will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are expected to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this chamber on matters involving the expenditure of many millions of dollars with our heads completely in the sand, as far as the Government is concerned.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister will remember that since this matter was first raised by the honourable member for Farrer and me there has again been a debate on it in another place, where it emerged that the majority of members there were still of the opinion which they expressed by their votes a year earlier that the ban should not be lifted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700605_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now ask the Minister whether the Government will sponsor a debate and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue in this House in this new Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700605_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In case it is again suggested that the Opposition should propose a motion on this matter, I would point out that not since March 1965 has it proved possible to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this House on any of the numerous motions introduced by private members on either the Government side or the Opposition side, we having found again yesterday- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700605_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take it that most honourable members on the other side will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The House has agreed to take each <span class="highlight">vote</span> separately and I am putting the question now that proposal (1) (a) in relation to sitting days be agreed to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question is that  the  motion moved by the Leader of  the  House be agreed to, to which the Leader of the Opposition has moved, by way of an amendment, that the following words be added to the motion:  and the conclusion of any speech by the honourable member for the Northern Territory and sufficient time thereafter to take  a  <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the second reading of the Bill.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the following words be added to the motion: ‘and the conclusion of any speech by the honourable member for the Northern Territory and sufficient time thereafter to take a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the second reading of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How did the Australian Government delegates <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the instruments adopted at the Fiftyfourth (1970) Session of the International Labour Conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that what will follow is that the proposed amendment to my motion will be moved and that we will then have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it very shortly afterwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I expect that the motion will be moved and then I expect honourable members will want to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it fairly quickly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the time has come for us to take a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have gathered from the voices around the chamber that the general consensus is that we should have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest when you put the question,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  ‘that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question,’ honourable members who want the starting times set out in the Standing Orders Committee’s report, namely 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., should <span class="highlight">vote</span> ‘yes’ - that the words stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members do not want a 10 a.m. and a 2 p.m. start they should <span class="highlight">vote</span> no’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of ‘no’ is carried then the House can apply standing order 167 which provides that when there is a complicated question the matter can be separated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the time has come for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he said that we on this side of the House would not cross the floor and <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the other side I said that Labor would do the same thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the Opposition will take a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the amendment when the gag is applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700923_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It occurred to me that if I could have the time of the House for a brief period, a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on these Bills could be taken at approximately 5.55 and, therefore, the debate would be completed and off the agenda paper by the time the House resumed at 8 o’clock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the Minister reconcile his statement on 14th October to the Leader of the Opposition that Malaysia will abstain, from a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the actual recognition of - Communist China, with his reference given today to Tun Ismail’s statement that Malaysia would, if necessary, cosponsor any move to admit China .to the United Nations by a simple majority? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>Mr WHITLAM (Werriwa- Leader of the Opposition) - I want to assure the Minister that my Party will permit a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be taken on any Bills upon which a cognate debate has been commenced before 11 p.m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This amendment is consequential upon the <span class="highlight">vote</span> which we have just taken, the result of which had the effect of taking Part IV out of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The matter has arisen because 2 members of the Opposition asked specifically for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this mailer l before the Chair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order that this matter may be resolved, as it is quite obvious that the Opposition wishes to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the subject, I suggest that the <span class="highlight">vote</span> be taken on the original motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So far as the Subsidiary and Special Bodies of the UN are concerned the General Assembly <span class="highlight">vote</span> is regarded as binding and the People’s Republic of China can automatically take its place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not good enough, as Askin in New South Wales says, that his Government cannot accede to the request to grant a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to 18-year olds or to introduce any form of legislation in this regard because of section 39b of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I claim to have been misrepresented in this respect: As the member elected for the Division of Cowper I have obtained 50 per cent of the primary <span class="highlight">vote</span> and I have been elected without a distribution of preferences, which is contrary to what was claimed to have occurred by the Minister for Services and Property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were told earlier that this was to be a free conscience debate and <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and on the 2 votes which have taken place honourable members on this side of the chamber have been seen to support various sides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>A free <span class="highlight">vote</span> is meaningless if it pertains to only one side of the chamber and I have not yet seen a display of a truly free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Government side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My recollection of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the last amendment is that it was something like just over 60 to around 30. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is not a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue, this is a Government Bill, and what the Government is saying is that that man should not be punished with the supreme penalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this clause which will have the effect of restoring the Bill to its original form, as I outlined in my second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In looking at this clause I am reminded of what Oliver Goldsmith once said:’Every absurdity has a champion to defend it’ I have no doubt that there will be some in this’ Committee who will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I thank him for his complimentary reference to me; but he spoke about a <span class="highlight">vote</span> which I cast in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he recalls the circumstances to his mind, he will remember that the clauses concerned did not come up in this chamber because the Bill was guillotined; so we did not have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My reason is that constitutional provisions must be introduced to ensure that the people will have an opportunity to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on these vital issues affecting this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It would appear that on this matter everybody in the chamber agrees that everybody entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the House of Representatives should be entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the question of amending the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances I believe that the objective that we all have - that is, the giving of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on proposals to amend the Constitution to every elector qualified to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the House of Representatives - is best secured by removing the limitation contained in the words ‘in each State’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, it may be that it is illegal as a contravention of section 48, sub-section 1, paragraph B of the Referendum (Constitution Alteration) Act, which prohibits publication or distribution of untrue or incorrect statements intended or likely to mislead any elector in his <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the threats by the Opposition parties to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Senate against the Government’s appropriation Bills and so refuse funds for the implementation of the Government’s legislation, can the Minister for Secondary Industry give the House any facts that would indicate the measure of prosperity of Australia’s secondary industries that has resulted from the efforts of this Labor Government compared with the efforts of the previous Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The House was debating the Bills and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> was supposed to be taken tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  has come on and grandstanded and said: ‘We want a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister running away from a debate and a discussion and <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue, having in mind the fact that the Minister knows that union leadership right throughout Australia is opposed to the provisions in this particular legislation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The letter advocated a negative <span class="highlight">vote</span> for both forthcoming referendums seeking Australian Government powers over prices and incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most pertinent factor is that the present Government has been returned to power with 49.3 per cent or just about half of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government won power in 1972 on 49.7 per cent of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However,  I  do not want members of the Press Gallery to write, as one did the last time  I  did not call for a division, that the Opposition failed because we allowed the matter to be resolved without a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>more than one-half of the members who record formal votes of those ballot papers <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of the amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a provision that would provide for a reasonable proportion of the people within a union to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a ballot for an amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I put the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the estimates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make this observation in general terms because, since we have not had full time to consider the proposals put forward, the Government will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the amendments moved by the honourable member for Moreton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While regretting the 2 phases of the amendment, namely, that the priority has gone out of the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden),  and, secondly, the false eulogy that the Government has introduced, praising the Australian Government, and because the Opposition believes that this is such an important social issue and that there should be unanimity in this House on the issue, the Opposition will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the motion as amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way in which that can be done, of course, is for the Opposition and the Government to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To assist honourable members I point out that if honourable members want the Family Law Bill to be discussed at the next sitting they will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the ayes; if they want it discussed on 1 1 February next they will <span class="highlight">vote</span> no. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is only reasonable that the Bill be recommitted for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the third reading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek the leave of the House, therefore, to move a motion to rescind the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the House on the third reading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is no need for any <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the matter in relation to the second reading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make one point at this stage: I regret that there was not a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this Bill and that more time was not given to debate the issues contained in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the ‘Australian’ newspaper this morning I was listed, among the members who were categorised as having voted against the second reading of the Family Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to make it clear that I did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the second reading of the Family Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>

    <p>Will he supply details of all payments from the <span class="highlight">vote</span> ‘Other Services- Support for Aboriginal Sporting Activities’ during 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-19-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that as clauses 45 to 52 are all covered in the amendments and are all related to the matter that he has just spoken on, we can take one <span class="highlight">vote</span> on his amendments numbered 32 to 39. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister is suggesting that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> be taken on the honourable member’s amendments numbered 32 to 39 which deal with clauses 45 to 52 and clauses 65 on the basis that basically they deal with the same question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This is a matter relating to the postal votes which we debated to some extent earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of the amendment will be that a postal voter will no longer be able to post or deliver his postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> to a divisional returning officer other than the divisional returning officer for the division in respect of which he is enrolled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is pointed out in the memorandum that it would create delay if the new proposal were incorporated into the Act, that is, that postal votes cannot be counted if they are received after the close of polling on polling day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the strong view of the Opposition that the present situation should remain- that 10 days after polling closes is an acceptable period for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be received and counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We oppose this clause believing that all divisions should be capable of receiving postal votes for other divisions; that it is part of the facilities, the rights, and the convenience that should be allowed to citizens; that to pass this clause will again increase the postal votes which will be invalid because they cannot be included in the count; and that it will deny the opportunity to electors to have their votes recorded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable member for Curtin  (Mr Garland)  is going to raise the question of religious groups being denied the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> I would suggest that he check his facts fairly carefully. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In relation to finance, which arises from the question, I point out that as far as the <span class="highlight">vote</span> for defence purposes is concerned, in the last financial year of the previous Liberal-Country Party Government- that is 1971-72-the expenditure was $1,2 17m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact we gave their representative a full <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this Parliament and the honourable member for the Northern Territory always opposed the proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: Is it reasonable to ask the Parliament to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Budget when it is already recognised that the deficit indicated in the Budget Papers is now to be exceeded by at least $700m? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should not the Government recast the Budget so that the Parliament can <span class="highlight">vote</span> on an accurate document with accurate figures? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The honourable member for Gwydir  (Mr Hunt)  suggested that I would not understand the problem that farmers would face if the polling booths were to close at 6 p.m. My view is that the Australian farming community should recognise that the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> is a very important one and that they should express a preparedness to stop work for a few minutes during the day to go to their local polling booth or, alternatively, to take out a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I am convinced that the majority of members of my Party and the coalition National Country Party of Australia share my views, but as we have never taken a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the subject we do not really know how we stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a Federal election were being held today, which party would receive your FIRST preference (if you had a <span class="highlight">vote</span>)? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw attention to clause 31 (5) which gives the member presiding a deliberative <span class="highlight">vote</span> and, in the event of votes being equal, a casting <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to sub-clause (5) which gives the casting <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also we realise that one of the members on our side of the House, the former  Speaker,  the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes),  received an additional <span class="highlight">vote</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker,  I repeat and draw to the attention of honourable members that the former  Speaker,  the honourable member for Corio, received one <span class="highlight">vote</span> more than the number of honourable members who sit on this side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we had the self-same situation here, where someone in the Liberal or Country Parties was not prepared to accept the decision of those Parties and used the secret ballot to record a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in opposition to one of the Government’s own members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you were one of the candidates,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  I just wonder where that <span class="highlight">vote</span> came from, or whether the Minister for the Capital Territory  (Mr Staley)  was getting square again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister intend altering the postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> application form to correct the present anomaly whereby many Australian servicemen and tourists are unable to <span class="highlight">vote</span> if they truthfully answer the section on permanent residence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-54-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section 85 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act provides, in part, that an elector who will be precluded from attending at any polling booth to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, due to an approaching maternity, may make application for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-54-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>( 1 ) Is it a fact that women more than 6 months pregnant are automatically entitled to a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-54-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was their cry, as though the fact that the people of Australia gave the Australian Labor Party a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of less than 50 per cent represents a defeat of democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I begin by saying that the Australian Labor Party’s platform provides for participatory democracy in union affairs and provides that no financial union member shall be deprived of the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the election of union committees exercising any powers of management and that no committee man shall be permitted to occupy a full time office unless he is elected by a direct secret <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the rank and file of his union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rules of the more democratic unions had already provided for the direct <span class="highlight">vote</span> of members for all offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a 7 per cent increase in the Australian Labor Party <span class="highlight">vote</span>, there was a 4 per cent swing overall on a  2-party  preferred <span class="highlight">vote</span> but there was over a 7 per cent swing from the last Federal election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to day nurseries in the inner suburbs of Sydney - the Government of New South Wales has never been interested in such a thing, perhaps - I do not know - because in the inner suburbs people tend to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the opposite Party, although the Labor Party was not very keen about it, either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My electors, I am sure, deplore the fact that a coalition that is a conglomeration of ginger groups, mushroom clubs, caterpillar clubs, Rhodesian lobbies and other factions can govern though it collectively received a <span class="highlight">vote</span> that was 6% less than that received by the Australian Labor Party alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having suggested that Brisbane Airport be re-located between the City of Brisbane and the Gold Coast he surely will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I propose to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment moved by the honourable member for Newcastle  (Mr Charles Jones)  as this is the only means available to me of saying to the Government that the selection of a new site is now a matter of urgency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It may well be that the select committee investigating airport noise is not the best kind of organisation to go into these technical matters but it is the only body in respect of which I now have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> which can undertake something that ought to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I am going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment moved by the Opposition as an indication that the sooner we set about finding an alternative site the better so that development cannot go on in that area which ultimately will make its use impossible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely a distinguished and honourable gentleman like the honourable member for La Trobe or the honourable member for Bradfield, who is in his own right a lawyer, will agree that this is a reasonable assumption on my part and that if they do <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment they will only be supporting the honourable member for Newcastle in some political tactics that he is putting forward here this evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They would <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment only because of its actual validity and I recommend to both honourable gentlemen, including my learned colleague the honourable member for Bradfield for whom I have a great respect, that they consider the amendment and ask themselves whether voting for it would be justifiable in terms of intellectual integrity or whether it would be simply a case of supporting tactics that will  bt  an irritation here in the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, before proceeding to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, I should like to bring several matters to the attention of honourable members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members on this side of the House may, for reasons of their own, cross the floor and <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition members would rue the day they crossed the floor to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday the Minister for Shipping and Transport  (Mr Sinclair),  as he has already stated, gave me an assurance that the Opposition would be afforded an opportunity to bring in a private member’s Bill, if it deemed that action necessary, and that there would bc a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on such a Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I can think of no valid reason whatsoever why any member of this Parliament, with any confidence in its competence, its value or its sovereignty ought not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member and his colleagues on the other side will <span class="highlight">vote</span> to retain that situation, unless they have changed their views, attitudes and prejudices since the last <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see no sound reason why honourable members opposite should <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this amendment unless it be that they are completely inhibited not by the demands of committee work but by the discipline of their Party and their failure to assert their rights in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an invitation to anarchy as properly described, lt is a matter of such importance that I expect that a statement will be made by a Minister in this House so that the matter can be properly debated so that the views which are held by honourable members in this House can be exposed; for I am quite sure that whatever certain members of the Parliamentary Labor Party believe their views are not the views of the great bulk of those people who <span class="highlight">vote</span> Labor and who support the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker,  the Opposition did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the motion for the second reading of the River Murray Waters Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the motion for the third reading of that Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it had been amended as we proposed then, we would not be voting against the third reading in the same way as we did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the second reading of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee voted against that amendment which we sought to the Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because clauses 10 (a) and 13 (a) are still in that Agreement and there is now no opportunity to amend the Agreement or to <span class="highlight">vote</span> upon the proposed amendment to the Agreement to delete them that the Opposition is voting against the third reading of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly, we did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the second reading of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those objectionable features still being there in the Agreement, the only recourse that we have to put our argument is to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the third reading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because those arguments have not been answered and rebutted we will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the motion for the third reading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the third reading of this Bill because the Agreement, as it still is, is objectionable to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it therefore the position that the ban was relaxed in breach of an undertaking given to those seeking the retention of the ban and that the action taken so far to maintain the ban is in accord with the only <span class="highlight">vote</span> ever taken inside the Parliament of this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thirteen of the 16 national and State organisations supported the partial lifting, and the Conference took a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In each case when the second  speaker  for the Opposition rose he was gagged and every member of the Government voted for it except one - and this is to the credit of the honourable member for La Trobe  (Mr Jess)  who in the debate yesterday on war service homes walked out rather than <span class="highlight">vote</span> against a matter in which he believed strongly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With that honourable exception every member of the Government has voted to gag any more speakers on each of these matters of urgency, none of them trivial, all of very considerable moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I can say is that I hope the House will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment I have moved because that amendment clearly points out that the Leader of the Opposition in this place did not seek to restrain the Opposition from following a course, from refusing to obey your ruling,  Mr Speaker,  from standing and shouting in this House in such a way that the Parlia ment could not properly continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it but they do not have the right to put in its place another censure motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would allow any member of the House who may be willing to <span class="highlight">vote</span> to censure the Minister to avoid doing so by voting for an amendment that wants to censure somebody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It allows the House to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on a totally different question and therefore avoid the whole content and meaning of the motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One may well believe that both members of the House deserve to be censured and one should not be deprived of the opportunity of voting for the censure of 1 member by the necessity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for or against the censure of another member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your ruling says, in effect, to members: Although you may believe that the Leader of the House should be censured you can only achieve your aim by declaring by your <span class="highlight">vote</span> that the Leader of the Opposition should not be censured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As other speakers have said, it has been accepted as a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of censure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If anyone here does not think that that is a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of censure I think he is a case for medical examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, if the words proposed to be left out are ordered not to stand part of the question, this <span class="highlight">vote</span> does not by itself express a decision against the motion, but only a preference for taking  a  decision upon the alternative proposition contained in the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson)  has referred to this <span class="highlight">vote</span> as being a trial to find out who is responsible for certain things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly honourable members on the Government side of the House did not want to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a way that would support the Leader of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they had to <span class="highlight">vote</span> today on the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition they would have in effect been voting for the Leader of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can assume that, if the motion had been put as it most certainly would when the debate had been concluded, there would have been members from the Government side who would have walked out and not participated in the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can accept - and I believe it would be reasonable to argue in this way - that there were some members on the Government side who, because of this dissatisfaction with the attitude of the Leader of the House yesterday, would not have voted on the motion which was moved by the Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed they would have refrained from exercising their right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the division when the question was put. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not intended in a serious spirit and it is the custom for the debate to proceed without interruption until the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that, when we take the <span class="highlight">vote</span>, the House will recognise the enormity of the position and will make it a lesson for the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The supine Government majority always will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for any gag without any debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken in a few minutes because somebody takes exception to what I am saying and it is proposed that I should be put out of the chamber, those honourable members would not know what they were voting on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that those procedures be inviolate, that there should be a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, that it should be a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> and that it should be properly counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not just give an ordinary <span class="highlight">vote</span> here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We, as a House of Parliament, give a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and it is an effective <span class="highlight">vote</span> because we are representatives of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister had a lot to say about the fact that there should be a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does anybody in bis wildest dreams imagine that there is a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this Parliament from the other side of the House? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>House have been forced to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the gag. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time and time again they have been forced to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for candidates for the Speakership whom they do not like and whom they would prefer to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against and try to prevent from being selected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that this is so, because I would not like to think that every member on the other side willingly votes for the gag every time the Leader of the House chooses to move it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We might as well all stay at home, save our fares in coming here, and send a telegram each time the Parliament meets and say: T am going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against such and such a matter on the notice paper’, and let the Liberals go on and do what they are doing here, walking to this side or that side of the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tactical move by the Prime Minister in moving an amendment was to prevent a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on a motion where Government supporters would have been expected and required to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Leader of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What has to be done is not merely to refuse to talk politics or religion, as is almost the general custom, to <span class="highlight">vote</span> once very 2 or 3 years and leave everything to those who win seats in Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nor is Australia an electoral democracy, because in the late hours of a night not so very long ago we passed through this Parliament amendments to the Electoral Act to ensure that the seat of Malley should have 45.000 voters and the seat of Wills should have 58,000 and also that around Australia there would be some people whose <span class="highlight">vote</span> would count for 4 and others for 3. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last occasion on which I was in Vietnam in areas off the beaten tracks and in the countryside made me quite certain that the people there were building day by day and week by week the means to form an opinion and to know how they should <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To me and, I think, to the majority of people, democracy means that when a fair and just election has been held - in which the people have been able to <span class="highlight">vote</span> freely - and the result has been obtained, the Government is allowed to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>for the Opposition has raised, speaking for myself I would have no objection whatsoever, without a motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders, without a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, I would be perfectly happy to undertake - in relation to matters other than petroleum matters- - to present to this House what it is that the honourable member could have asked for without going into this great song and dance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No, but I had a very good representative there, one of your side who always tells me what happens when anything goes against the Prime Minister, oddly enough, and he told me that he is ready to cross the floor and <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Prime Minister on this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he wants to be fair dinkum he may merve an amendment or he may oppose the Bill; but as always happens we will see the members of the Country Party, who say that this is a cruel and vicious tax, support the Government when it comes to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the summation of what I have said tonight: That the family enterprise has been demonstrated to be both efficient and effective and is the backbone of the rural development of the nation; that the current crisis is a product of policies or the absence of policies; that imposts, such as estate duty, must be totally reconstructed; that this small measure should be only a prelude to this being done as a matter of urgency; and that the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the amendment that has been put forward should be a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that for <span class="highlight">vote</span> catching reasons every honourable member would like to climb on that bandwagon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to be the common practice of many honourable members on the Government side to criticise Government policies implicitly, and often explicitly, outside of the Parliament and then they do nothing in the Parliament to show their disapproval when it comes to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable member for Macarthur  (Mr Jeff Bate)  feels so strongly about some of the problems that he has mentioned, I would suggest that he take more constructive action and show what he feels in the House when votes are taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since then there has again been a debate on the matter in another place where it emerged that the majority of members were still of the opinion, which they expressed by their votes a year earlier, that the ban should not be lifted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is, unhappily, totally consistent with the whole sequence of attitudes of members of the Labor Party, whose predecessors in the last century fought with great vigour, great consistency and great determination to get a right for all people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> to elect a Parliament which could govern with authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to the second part of the honourable gentleman’s question, which related to the Indonesian initiative, particularly from  Mr Malik,  the simple goals of the conference are as follows: Firstly, it is to be related to Cambodia if it can be kept that way; secondly, to try to ensure that there is no interference in the affairs of other countries, particularly Cambodia; thirdly, Cambodia to have the right of self determination and the people, by a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>, to be able to express their opinions and have their opinions brought into legislative and constitutional effect; finally, that the International Control Commission for Cambodia be reinstated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is no friend of the Labor Party, as he said in his speech earlier today, but he is prepared to back his point of view and his honour by a <span class="highlight">vote</span> which he knows must place in jeopardy his political future, and I hope the political future of most of those who sit opposite me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as I am concerned, following the 15 years for which 1 have been a member of this House, if I have to place reliance upon the judgment, the integrity, the sincerity and the keenness of observation of the honourable member for Farrer against that of the present Minister for Education and Science, my <span class="highlight">vote</span> goes to the honourable member for Farrer because the Minister for Education and Science, during his time in this House as Attorney-General, continually associated himself with the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we come to a stage where some members of a parliamentary party are prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against that party on some ground of issue and’ principle, it is a matter of high moment indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those members are morally bound to cross the floor and <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the -Opposition on this occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why on earth should we support matters being left in the hands of the States whether they are continental shelves or not when it is known that the States either have upper houses in which, even if we received the overwhelming support of the Australian public, we would have no majority or they have a legislature like the one in Queensland where with  2i  times the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Country Party we are battling to get as many seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether people who made charges against the Prime Minister are prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against him is entirely their business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if an honourable member endorses the charges of the honourable member for Farrer and then votes that the Government should continue in office after having broken its promises to the States, he is in a very peculiar position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also a peculiar position to <span class="highlight">vote</span> to sustain a government which he believes breaks its promises in vital negotiations with the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>but 1 have already said that the essential point is that the motion asks the House to censure the Government, whilst the amendment urges it to approve the Government’s action, and ny opinion is that a motion that seeks to censure the Government, should be met by a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of ‘aye’ or ‘no’ rather than by an amendment that is a negation of the motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what we are asking the House to <span class="highlight">vote</span> about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the House is to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on a proposition the simplest and most effective way to do that is to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for or against the proposition, not to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for or against a proposition that is put up as an amendment and presented to the House as an alternative to that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment moved by the honourable member for Casey is quite clearly a proposition which is a direct contradiction of what we have been asked to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for in the first place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What conceivable argument can there be that we should proceed to consider an amendment to get exactly the same result as we can get if we <span class="highlight">vote</span> for or against the original motion? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the  Speaker  in 1936 put it very vividly, the <span class="highlight">vote</span> has to be aye or nay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, on this <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence the <span class="highlight">vote</span> cannot be aye or nay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment is going to be put first and honourable members can <span class="highlight">vote</span> for or against the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the amendment is carried there will be no <span class="highlight">vote</span> at all on the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to try a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it and see bow the numbers go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is upon that alternative that the House will be asked to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House will <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the amendment of the honourable member for Casey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members <span class="highlight">vote</span> as I confidently expect them to and support the amendment of the honourable member for Casey, that amendment, having been carried, will become the motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will then <span class="highlight">vote</span> upon that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I expect that until the members from the other side who are now winging their way here arrive there will be no possibility of co-operation from the Opposition in taking  a  <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The way to deal with a proposition is to <span class="highlight">vote</span> aye if you support it and nay if you do not support it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at it that way, it seems very difficult for me, on the basis of any sort of logical analysis, to arrive at any other conclusion either about this particular set of circumstances, or an earlier set of circumstances, than that the House is being asked to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on two questions of which one is virtually the negative of the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have gone from the high drama of the morning and the afternoon to this after-dinner period when the members of the Opposition are, by means of procedural devices, playing out time until they can build up their numbers to make the Government’s majority when a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken a little less than it otherwise would be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment is not a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence in the Government hut it is a censure of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House has an alternative now, either to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for no confidence in the Government or to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for an amendment which is a significant criticism of the Government and a significant censure of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister no longer wants that proposition to be tested because it was obvious that the honourable member for Farrer was going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against him, probably the honourable member for Casey  (Mr Howson)  was going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against him and the honourable member for Macarthur  (Mr Jeff Bate)  was going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody was quite sure how the honourable member for Lilley  (Mr Kevin Cairns)  was going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> although later he said that despite the fact that he agreed completely with the version of the honourable member for Farrer he was still going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the course of the whole afternoon today the Gorton Government was at the brink of disaster and was dependent on the votes of 3 or 4 people who were worked on in various ways during the course of the afternoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will leave the numbers to the Government because we know that it has enough people to win the <span class="highlight">vote</span> irrespective of the arguments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But every time he has to put his <span class="highlight">vote</span> up to test that, he goes to water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Fairbairn declared in Parliament that he would <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Opposition on the censure motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> came  Mr Fairbairn  walked from the chamber and abstained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the result, the <span class="highlight">vote</span> from which I abstained was not taken on the Opposition amendment but on the later amendment of the honourable member for Casey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If honourable members look at the record of votes on page 2328 of Hansard they will see that the first division is headed  (Mr Howson’s amendment)’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally I wish to make it clear that I committed myself to support the Opposition’s amendment, and I would have done so if it had been voted on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence in the Government, loan investors have subscribed less than $2m to the long term bonds in the February loan of S200m, two-thirds of which was absorbed by redemptions for loans then maturing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The right honourable gentleman will have noted the decision by some State governments to reduce the voting age to 18 if they secure the co-operation of the Commonwealth Government which compiles the roll of voters for State parliaments as well as the Commonwealth Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it has not, does the Prime Minister expect that it will come to a decision in time for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be taken on the Bill I introduced in November 1968 and which is on the notice paper for me to introduce again in the week after next? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, of course, by some kind of a trick the Opposition might <span class="highlight">vote</span> for something that it does not believe in just to get some kind of an upheaval on the Government side but it immediately dishonours the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think you mean to keep that pledge and you have said that you will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this and that means it is helping you to carry out your pledge, and therefore you are honest about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We moved amendments to 9 others on the second reading: after those amendments were defeated we did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the second reading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On one of those Bills and on 7 others we moved amendments at the Committee stage; in only 1 case did we <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the third reading when the amendments were defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every member of Parliament would thus, regardless of party, be able to make constructive criticism or proposals without being polarised into party positions because a <span class="highlight">vote</span> was due. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the Parliament and both sides of the Parliament should devote more attention to not just the general question of standing committees but to whether there are some kinds of standing committees which could advantageously operate side by side with th. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, an Estimates debate really ought to be that when a department’s estimates are brought before the Parliament members of Parliament should be able to say: Why is this particular <span class="highlight">vote</span> greater in this year than it was last year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the reasons for the increase in that <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why was that <span class="highlight">vote</span> dropped? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it does not go on at all perhaps it is a reflection on members of Parliament here generally, but what I was suggesting was that in that field there could be outside of this place committees sitting with the benefit of a Minister before them, with the benefit of public servants before them - not to disclose departmental matters but to give the factual reasons why this <span class="highlight">vote</span> was smaller than it was last year, why that <span class="highlight">vote</span> was larger and why a new <span class="highlight">vote</span> was there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Voluntary organisations have more get up and go and more initiative in broad national planning than this Government which ought to be giving the lead and which ought to be educating the grass roots people so that they can use their <span class="highlight">vote</span> intelligently and can assist the Government instead of having to buck it all the time to get the slightest minimum of action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we proceed further from this point without national water planning, without national legislation, and if the cost benefit of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is to be the only guiding factor, then we are not going to make the progress as a nation that we should make if we are to hand it on in a reasonable condition to the children who will follow us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This arises because the philosophy upon which the Government largely bases its action in social welfare seems to be <span class="highlight">vote</span> purchasing power which is cynically calculated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main question seems to be how many votes can be bribed, rather than a commitment to people and to society which guides what is being done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Social programmes depend more on estimates of their <span class="highlight">vote</span> catching strength than on serious study of people’s needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be noticed from the second answer that votes are now given in 3 of the Canadian provinces al 18; in another 3 at19, and in New Zealand the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is given at 20. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Netherlands has also given the <span class="highlight">vote</span> at 18. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not only my own Party which has had the policy of votes at 18 for quite some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that there can always be arguments for saving that it is not appropriate or not proper to give women the <span class="highlight">vote</span>, to give negroes the <span class="highlight">vote</span> or to give Aboriginals the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly sooner or later 18- year-olds will have the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is one very real reason why a <span class="highlight">vote</span> should be given at a younger age than it is at the present time in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if people were given the <span class="highlight">vote</span> at 18 years of age one would not only remove a great number of the causes of discontent symbolised by student power but one would also remove a great number of the causes of discontent which one finds in the developing areas of the capital cities and in the provincial areas - the development areas of this continent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is very clear that we would remove the causes of discontent in this country to a more marked extent than in any other way if we were to give the <span class="highlight">vote</span> to people who are involved in this respect, if we were to involve them in the political, democratic process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think, therefore, we must acknowledge that the resistance to votes at 18 is due to the fear among a great number of conservative persons in this country that their interests and their supporters would be diminished if votes were given at 18. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said that and not wanting to canvass the merits of those 2 matters, I do believe that I should identify what I feel is the only ground for resisting votes at 18 for this national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have very little doubt indeed that on a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this place this Bill would be passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>L am speaking for much less than the time allotted to me on this because 1 am anxious’ for other honourable members to speak on it and I am anxious that the House should <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think it is fair to say that on the last occasion the tactic was to spin out the debate for so long that no <span class="highlight">vote</span> could be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe the number of countries which are now giving votes at 18. the number of countries which are allowing marriage without consent at 1 8 and the number of Australians who will now get the <span class="highlight">vote</span> at 18 for their State parliaments, now make this Bill a matter of urgency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has with every justification reminded me of my recent past and has drawn the attention of the House to the fact that when I took part in the same sort of debate in November 1968 1 expressed a view which was favourable to the granting of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to people of 18 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather is the Government’s attitude simply that the question of reducing the age at which marriage may be contracted without consent and the question of whether the age of eligibility to <span class="highlight">vote</span> should be reduced are questions of great importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That slates in substance that no adult who has a right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> under the law of a State shall be deprived, having that right, of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a Commonwealth election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one adopts that interpretation of section 41 as a possible view - it is sufficient for my purpose to regard it only as a possible view - there is a strong argument for the Commonwealth leading in this field and leading now by giving the <span class="highlight">vote</span> to 18-year-old people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the right to marry and <span class="highlight">vote</span> is conferred, of course the full right of contract and of proprietorship must follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The position is that in certain instances - I refer to those young people who are serving overseas and to those who apply for special consideration - young people automatically are entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report went on with a quotation crf some of the remarks of a person who was opposing any reduction in the age of people who may <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and also young people accepting responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I accept the criticism that this decision to make further investigations and further studies can be used as an excuse to delay bringing in legislation; but I come back to the point I mentioned earlier that, because of al’l the complexities of the matter, because this subject in itself is not just an isolated question of whether a certain age group should be given the <span class="highlight">vote</span> or be allowed to marry at the age of 18 years and because of all the other factors that flow from this I. believe that this is a measure that should be given very serious consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some nf the new Labor MP’s, openly concerned at the amount of time their Party devotes to rural matters both in the House and iti Caucus, staged a show of strength last Friday when they forced  Dr Rex  Patterson, Labor’s shadow Minister for Primary Industry, lo defer putting hi new wool programme to a Caucus <span class="highlight">vote</span> until he produced a detailed report on its costs and benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me warn the farmers of this country that if the Opposition is elected to power and it implements the 1 <span class="highlight">vote</span> 1 value policy, as was announced by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam),  we will see the elimination of at least 2 wheat seats in this country, thereby reducing the voice of the fanner further and putting him further into the wilderness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can imagine the honourable member for Dawson travelling through the huge area of Queensland, including the drought areas, explaining to the fanners why he voted for these 6 Bills because the farmers will have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Bills because the industry wants what is called orderly or organised marketing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For once - far be it for me to do it too often - I commend those limited rebels of the Liberal Party in another place who sent this amendment back twice because for once they have cast an intelligent <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the interests of the people to see that the people are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the second reading of the Bill but will move in the Committee stage for the omission of the 13th Schedule of the Bill to indicate our opposition to these proposals and to separate that opposition from the fact that we do not oppose other parts of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Thirteenth Schedule to the Bill as well as the third reading of the Bill because it believes that the section of the Tariff Board’s report which deals with the textile industry is detrimental to the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He pointed out that the temporary duties do not apply unless the 13th schedule is passed, in saying that we would oppose the schedule I mentioned that there were some parts of it thatI did not want to oppose but that rather than separate those parts from other parts, which would have involved a good deal of work and time.I proposed to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the whole schedule to show our opposition to the implementation of the proposals arising out of the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly, in the case of a Territory it seems clear that the Parliament may, if it thinks fit, allow representation in the Senate by a representative or representatives who, although able to take their places and speak in the chamber, would not be senators in the true sense or be entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, except perhaps in a restricted way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only have we solicitude for honourable members opposite, including the honourable member for the Northern Territory, but we would like to see democracy maintained and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> taken on this motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the motion of the Leader of the House is carried there will be no <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue and the honourable member for the Northern Territory will not be heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support it so that we will have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this great issue, because I do not want the opinion to be created, as the Minister does, that the honourable member for the Northern Territory does everything the Minister wants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government has nothing to be afraid of and if it believes in more democratic representation for everybody what is wrong with a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and what is wrong with the honourable member speaking? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My predecessor held the seat with 67% of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I held it with about 57% of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other reason why I have moved for the suspension of Standing Orders is the <span class="highlight">vote</span>, 55 to 54, which defeated the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he had voted in support of the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition, his action would have meant that he was supporting at least further debate on the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first reason was the vital importance of this proposition, which seeks to allow the people of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> or a voice in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second reason is that the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition was 55 to 54. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The person who could have changed the outcome of that <span class="highlight">vote</span> was the honourable member for the Northern Territory, who voted to gag himself and so prevent himself from speaking on this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that if we are not allowed to discuss this issue and <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it the Government is adopting evasive tactics so that it will not be placed in the position of having to indicate clearly to the 64,000 people of the Northern Territory and to the people of the Australian Capital Territory that it has no intention of providing for them a basic right which is available to every other person in the Australian States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have we wasted our time and a great deal of taxpayers money this morning by merely talking aimlessly, for it is clearly the objective of the Government that the debate will fulfil no purpose and that every endeavour should be carried out to avoid a <span class="highlight">vote</span> being taken and a decision being made? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the  Chairman  or the  Deputy Chairman  presiding at a meeting have a deliberative <span class="highlight">vote</span> and, in the event of an equality of voting, also have a casting <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course then the House is expected to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Bill in toto, lt cannot possibly be altered because its contents have been agreed upon between sovereign powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that no law should be put on the statute book unless at least the present number required for a quorum are present and <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 will have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the proposal as it now stands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that, if we adopted this proposal we would be casting a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence in the value of our own deliberations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe that a reduction in the quorum for the pure symbolic value of the act is a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence in ourselves, in our deliberations, in the value of debate and in the importance of what we decide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are to have a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this matter in which everybody is interested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Usually when the bells are rung members arrive and ask: ‘Which way do I <span class="highlight">vote</span>’, if they do not know what the subject is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Presently the bells will be rung ami we will <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this motion, but I propose to oppose this provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of members will come into the chamber not knowing what they are to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on but on this occasion they have to make up their own minds, lt is no good in this instance looking to see which way the party leaders are voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A reduction in the quorum would be a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence in the deliberations of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Wills over-emphasised - I do not under-emphasise it - the importance of being here to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on an issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of us come into this chamber to <span class="highlight">vote</span> when we do not have a clue in the world about what we are to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Admittedly there was a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House of Commons knows well in advance when a <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had Opposition members chosen not to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on those occasions the sitting of the House would have been suspended for want of a quorum because the Government did not have a quorum in the House and the Opposition had disgracefully few members present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government Ministers and those from the major political parties who have been Ministers, have considered the maintaining of a standing order which prevents the suspension of the Standing Orders to be of such importance that unless an absolute majority of members is present and votes for the proposition the Standing Orders cannot be suspended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is considered necessary for an absolute majority to be present to suspend the Standing Orders, it is not an unreasonable proposition that at least an absolute majority be present when legislation is passed, even though they do not all <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the legislation, as they are required to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the suspension of Standing Orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only real, permanent effect of the changing of the size of a quorum would be in relation to the number of people who must be here when the House assembled in order legally to constitute the House; how many people must be here when the House assembled each day in order legally to commence the operations of the House; and how many people must be in the chamber and actually <span class="highlight">vote</span> in order to validate legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only important thing is how many members are in here to <span class="highlight">vote</span> when legislation is passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a Bill is not contested by honourable members it is passed by a consensus of opinion and not actually on a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If 14 members voted for a measure they could pass it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It was only by an accident of fate that I happened to be here to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the last night of the last sitting period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said last night, I hope that we will not fritter the night away talking about these matters when, If we took a <span class="highlight">vote</span> now, the numbers would be clearly in favour of this proposed change and we could then get home to bed and arrive here bright tomorrow morning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I for one will <span class="highlight">vote</span> that the number remain unaltered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe it is most important that when legislation is carried it should be carried by the deliberate <span class="highlight">vote</span> of as many members of this Parliament as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask him: How long would it take to include these younger citizens on the electoral rolls for any State where they are given adulthood rights and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the more numerous house of the State Parliament and where, under section 41 of the Constitution, they cannot be prevented from voting at elections for either House of this Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The  Chairman  shall have a deliberative <span class="highlight">vote</span> and, in the event of an equality of votes, also have a casting <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The opportunity has occurred, as a result of the work of the Standing Orders Committee, to place this matter before the Parliament and the further opportunity has occurred because of the agreement of the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  - almost his initiative, I would say - for questions associated with the Parliament to be decided by members by a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the motion is defeated, we will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Bills here and in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that if a referendum were held and the people of Victoria were asked whether they wanted an international airport and whether they wanted it at Tullamarine there would be an overwhelming <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of both, because most people do not live near the airport and they would not know what the sound of aircraft taking off and landing was like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The sort of area where the Liberal <span class="highlight">vote</span> is highest, where land is eagerly sought after, is right under the flight path of the east-west runway approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In spite of what the Leader of the House  (Mr Snedden)  thinks, he is going to be greatly outvoted on the recommendation to adjourn the House at 10.30 p.m. with provision for the adjournment debate after that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is up to every member to take part in a revolution, to <span class="highlight">vote</span> some sanity and sense into our Standing Orders when the Standing Orders <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As we will all have a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on that issue, let us all vole for earlier nights so that we can be more effective members of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In that case a <span class="highlight">vote</span> will follow at some time and the House will decide whether it will adjourn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet I point out that last year some Opposition members said that the 1969-70 Budget should be discarded as being an irresponsible social services budget and more like a bow to <span class="highlight">vote</span> card than a financial document. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However I feel that, when my friend the honourable member for Corio said that he did not speak to earn votes, he was being a trifle unfair to honourable members on this side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  for I believe that it expresses not only the spirit of this House, although that will not be reflected in the <span class="highlight">vote</span>* but also the spirit of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In concluding my remarks on the rural section I point out that the essential difference between the Government’s policy and the Opposition’s policy is that the Government endeavours to implement the policy of the primary producers expressed through their elected representatives, while the Opposition in a blatant <span class="highlight">vote</span> catching exercise supports generally the dissentient minority without regard to the welfare of the industry and those engaged in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Country Party polled 523,242 votes, making a total of 2,750,229 votes for the Government parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that the Labor Party polled more votes than the Government parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another aiding factor was the donkey <span class="highlight">vote</span>, as was clearly shown in  Mr Speaker’s  electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only possible explanation for the Government’s disregard of these petitions is that it is aware that it has lost and will never regain the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the pensioners and the community by its duplicity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The result of this type of dissent may be, as was pointed out the other day, a massive <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence in the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I expect that, as usual, I will get from the other side the catcall ‘Are you going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it?’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I should like to make it clear right at the beginning that I do not intend to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment proposed by the Labor Party because in my opinion the amendment is ridiculous, lt is couched in terms which are those of an ambitious man who wishes to take control of this country in any circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 was thrilled the other night to find that 2 members of the Opposition voted as they did on an issue which concerned the Public Works Committee and the Melbourne Airport runway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although their Party voted against the motion before the House they decided to stand by their word and to <span class="highlight">vote</span> with this side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wholeheartedly support that amendment and the stated intention of my Party to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Appropriation Bills if the amendment is defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Normally the boys in charge make the decisions and they get a yes <span class="highlight">vote</span> from the chaps in the hall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The men in the trade union hall and those members who are not present would not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this kind of radical militancy because they know that the minute a Labor Government gains power Australia will be in an impossible situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a split <span class="highlight">vote</span> - 34 each side - as to whether the problems of rural industries were worth the time of the Labor Party in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget proposes a defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> of $l,137m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In future the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be susceptible to the impact of the 5-year rolling defence programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first significant point to be noted about the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> is that it represents a lower share of total Commonwealth spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt the Minister for the Navy  (Mr Killen)  will be able to explain the reason for the drastic reduction in the naval section of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> and certainly the Minister will have the opportunity to  give  some indication as to why other essential defence services, particularly those areas upon which the defence Services are so dependent, will receive consideration as outlined in this Budget but no mention is made at all in relation to Cockburn Sound. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, he seems to be stirred up - I hope he is not too stirred up - about the fact that in the estimates dealing with the Department of the Navy there is on the figures - I emphasise ‘on the figures’ - a fall in the <span class="highlight">vote</span> related to naval construction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Budget will not be taken until shortly before dinner tomorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this Budget is $ 1, 137m and represents about 14 per cent of our total expenditure for the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Government at this time on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor means a sell-out in South East Asian defence and a yes <span class="highlight">vote</span> for galloping decline in public morality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However I congratulate him on his charitable attitude, but it is strange that he should speak so strongly against the Budget and yet refuse to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the country does not accept the Budget the people should <span class="highlight">vote</span> the Government out of office at the next election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For 20 minutes we have just heard the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder),  representing one-sixth of Australia, telling us that he was disappointed in the Budget and setting out a catalogue of things he would like done in the 500,000 square miles of his electorate, and then telling us how we must have the courage to stand for all the things Australia stands for, instead of being asked to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the things he said he used to stand for in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We offered him the opportunity a few weeks ago to <span class="highlight">vote</span> to give his people more representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a very large area, only about 11 square miles, with a population of 120,000 people of whom 55,000 or 56,000 are voters, lt is a great, throbbing industrial area, lt is part of the real produc tive capacity of Australia and, of course, most of the great productive areas of Australia are represented by Labor members, both in the country and in the city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who <span class="highlight">vote</span> Liberal say that they are ashamed of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a meeting the other day I heard a person who ordinarily votes Liberal say that it would have been better if the Government had given nothing at all because, as my friend the honourable member for Hughes  (Mr Les Johnson)  pointed out today, the Budget contains in essence things that are insulting to the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the majority of honourable members would agree with me about that premise - if we came to a simple straight <span class="highlight">vote</span> on capital punishment, for instance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can believe only that this action represents the result of a majority <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has been out-voted and he has put up, in his answer to the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  today, a brave front. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the House rises for dinner tonight a <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be taken on Appropriation Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the honourable gentleman tell the House before it votes whether he has decided to introduce a Receipts Duties Bill in the form in which it was previously passed by the House but rejected by the Senate, or in a different form, or not at all? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the <span class="highlight">vote</span> tonight a series of Budget Bills will be introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The arrogance of this Government, particularly the Executive, with only a couple of hours of debate remaining before a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken on the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam),  is shown by its adjourning the Budget debate so that a statement, for which we have been waiting years, could be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our defence forces will and must, as a continuing process, seek the best use of that <span class="highlight">vote</span> among the array of priorities presenting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, he said he would not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Budget because he could not join the Labor Party under any circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would have supported it because it had previously been moved as an amendment by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Barnard)  and defeated on a <span class="highlight">vote</span> by the Minister and his colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the House that it was the will of the Government Parties and of the Opposition Party that there should be a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on these 3 matters which I have enumerated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I am not as committed to the 10.30 a.m. start I would <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has properly pointed out that in all of these issues the respective parties have determined that there should be a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope only that the Minister will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for his proposals when the question is put to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Upon  the  putting of any question, any member may require the adjournment of the Debate, and in such case die next Business of the Day shall be called on forthwith, and the adjourned <span class="highlight">Vote</span> shall be taken as soon as convenient after the first occurring of 2 p.m or 8 p.m., and the adjourned Debate, if not already concluded, shall then be resumed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  hope that honourable members will <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the amendment as they think fit because the question of whether we should transform our proceedings along the lines suggested by the Minister is worthy of testing by the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe that it is important that the House should <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment to enable these important committees to meet and have ample time to meet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us use this occasion when we have an individual <span class="highlight">vote</span> to good advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I oppose the amendment of the honourable member for Maribyrnong and will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the recommendations of the Standing Orders Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to the House that those who are in favour of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Maribyrnong  (Dr Cass)  will <span class="highlight">vote</span> ‘No’ on this question and that those who are in favour of the report of the Standing Orders Committee, to which the amendment was moved, will <span class="highlight">vote</span> ‘Aye’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members are interested in the quality of their speeches and if, as was suggested during the debate on a motion earlier tonight, people are interested, whether they are listening to the debate during meal hours or at any other time, they should recognise that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of shorter speeches will in fact be a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for better preparation of speeches, if they want them to be effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that honourable members ought to examine the whole procedure very carefully before they <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope they will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some honourable members opposite have been weeping about lack of opportunities to speak, but when did they ever <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the gag? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for reducing the time alloted for speeches to allow more members to come in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to see as many members as possible get the opportunity to speak, and with that objective in view I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a reduction in the time allotted for speeches in order to give all members the opportunity at some stage to say what they want to say on behalf of the constituents they represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The philosophy of the Vietnam Moratorium is to ignore the fact that in this Parliament are members who are elected to come here to debate, put issues, resist issues and <span class="highlight">vote</span> on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is important that the House exercise its authority and require the presence of no fewer than one-third of members be present when a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is being taken on legislation, as distinct from the ordinary sitting of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, if the amendment which we are considering had been embodied in a standing order and a question were put to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> right at the moment, we would not be competent to pass a valid <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>lt  could be televised even on occasions such as that of the recent <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not talking about the honourable members who are in this chamber at the moment; I am talking about those members who are available to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the last <span class="highlight">vote</span> that was taken the numbers were 43 to 27. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of Government and Opposition; it was an individual <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts are that out of 125 members only 72 voted in a division a few moments ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That honourable member voted for a 4-day sitting week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the reduction of the size of the quorum from one-third to onefifth of the total number of members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation was that not even one-third of the number of members of this House was present and I did not call for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the measures under discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wills requests is that one-third of our membership- 42 members - remain here to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on a Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the benefit of the honourable member for Deakin, I point out that, whilst the House has decided that a quorum shall be one-fifth of the total membership of this House, the honourable member for Wills is asking that no measure be carried unless one-third of the membership of this House is present to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is provision in the Standing Orders that if on the counting of a division fewer than one-third of the members <span class="highlight">vote</span> then it is declared not to be a decision taken on the division of the House and the House is adjourned until the next day of sitting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Bill is passed, on a division only one-fifth of the members of the House will need to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the amendment is accepted on a division one-third of the members would be required to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All honourable members know the issues and we should <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the matter as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let honourable members get out on the hustings at election time and tell the people from whom they expect support that of a total of  125  elected members if  25  members <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a division a simple majority of those who <span class="highlight">vote</span> will suffice for an affirmative decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the ruling is against my view I propose to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the amendment, in any case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a free, non-party <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be taken by members of the Parliament who not only want to sec the Parliament work efficiently but also want the Parliament to be a permanent safeguard for the people of Australia against tyranny, despotism and the kind of abuse of power which governments sometimes take upon themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is on record that I am one of the members who voted against the general reduction in the quorum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This amendment gives me another chance to make the quorum as I thought it should be constituted operate on the special occasion of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the House and, of course, I will act accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, because there are other people who wish to speak, may I merely underline the point that the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on principle in this matter was a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> so there can be no suggestion that the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was pressured, railroaded or rammed through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have taken a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on principle which, in effect, is the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on a particular matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, those who were beaten on a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> are making a last ditch stand to recommit the same matter as was won on principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Likewise, it is misleading to suggest that because a member is not in this chamber he does not know what is going on here or what, in all likelihood, will be the result of the measure, because matters are debated throughout the country and around this building for days, weeks and even months before they come to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, in many cases the result is a foregone conclusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Rumour has it that those recommendations brought to the House by the Honourable member for Wilis  (Mr Bryant)  are not going to receive the support of the Government; that, in fact, the free <span class="highlight">vote</span> of Government members is being withdrawn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems quite unsatisfactory to me that the Senate should decide in favour of Capital Hill, that the House of Representatives should be divided almost 50-50 on the location and that the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  should walk into this chamber, without a <span class="highlight">vote</span> being permitted in the Senate, and announce to the world at large that the new parliament house will not be on Capital Hill, which site was so overwhelmingly supported by the Senate, but on Camp Hill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This country would be bankrupt in less than a week while Parliament was sitting, for the simple reason that when it came to increasing pensions everybody who wanted to please his constituents would <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it, and when it came to reducing taxation all honourable members would be voting on the one side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the part of the book where David Halberstam writes about the elections in which Diem always received a vast majority of the votes and indeed Diem’s candidates received more votes than the number of people who turn up to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A large proportion of growers (nearly 35 per cent) did not take the trouble to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the plan to be implemented required a substantial majority of those entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be in favour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been asked by way of interjection how many people voted informally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The table to which  1  have referred shows that  9  votes were rejected as informal and  84  votes were rejected for other reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To a certain extent it was because of apathy that a sufficient number of growers did not <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been shown, the number who did <span class="highlight">vote</span> were by a large majority in favour of the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it comes about then I believe that sufficient growers this time will <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for this reason that my office, with the concurrence, of course, of the Parliament by its <span class="highlight">vote</span>, is directing moneys to this effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The outcome was that the scheme was rejected, not because of a negative <span class="highlight">vote</span> but because of apathy on the part of the dried fruit vine growers to have a poll of sufficient producers to give SO per cent support by the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a positive <span class="highlight">vote</span> but it was by only a minority group of growers and as a result the proposal was rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a <span class="highlight">vote</span> catcher his argument sounded very attractive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such action just prior to an election was misleading and taken with a view to winning votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when the time comes for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and the members are being counted we can be sure that none of those supporters of the pensioners will come over to this side of the House and <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Right throughout the Budget debate Government supporters said that the Government could have done more for the pensioners, but when it comes to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this Bill they will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Bill, and so for all its deficiencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it should be made clear and brought into sharp relief that the issues on which the Parliament is about to be called to <span class="highlight">vote</span> are very limited and very specific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700918_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest to the honourable member that he should have another look at the figures for the Chisholm by-election and ask himself how the combined Australian Democratic Labor Party and Liberal <span class="highlight">vote</span>, which represented approximately 61 per cent of the total votes cast in Chisholm 9 months ago, has dissipated to 53 per cent in a very short time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700922_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would have been reasonable to expect the Labor Party, in putting before the Parliament the proposition for the appointment of a select committee on which we as members are asked to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, to indicate the types of statutory corporation on which we should exercise our judgment, but it has not done anything of the sort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700923_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The growing <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the organisation which calls itself DOGS- the Defence of Government Schools Organisation - is also a sign of a growing conviction about the neglect of State schools in the poorer areas of our country and failure to establish an educational system which will eliminate inequalities in education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable member for Lilley  (Mr Kevin Cairns)  has said, the amendment moved by the Opposition has allowed those honest Labor men who are uncomfortable to come in now and <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it whereas otherwise they would have had to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in support of their leader. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Askin,  on one famous occasion in the town of Leeton made a speech under a sign which read: <span class="highlight">Vote</span> Grassby (1) for Mumimbidgee’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr McEwen)  not so long ago spoke under signs which were in red and which read: ‘<span class="highlight">Vote</span> Grassby for Riverina and for progress’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the basis of the charge of supposed high seriousness that we have heard today as the basis for the call for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence in the Prime Minister and the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are the true issues of the confidence <span class="highlight">vote</span> tonight and I leave the House and the nation to judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the time comes it will be tested and both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition as people, both of whom I know and have seen over many years, will go before the people and there is no doubt where, in my judgment, the people’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> will go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The departmental <span class="highlight">vote</span> itself has increased by about $10m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#debate-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this instance the departmental <span class="highlight">vote</span> has been increased from $33m to $44m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#debate-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is this: If it is good enough for the Commonwealth to advance funds for the development of the fair city of Canberra and for other territories under the control of the Commonwealth, what is wrong with the concept that the Government ought to accept its responsibility, along with the <span class="highlight">vote</span> that it receives, to arrest this tremendous burden which is placed upon teenagers and young people in the community as a result of the ever increasing and spiralling cost of land? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the amendment is to do this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he also consider abolishing the present practice of handing how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> cards to electors  at  the entrance to polling booths and in lieu thereof provide for the display of authorised how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> cards in every cubicle in every polling booth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that almost all electors have made up their minds how they are to <span class="highlight">vote</span> before they reach -the entrance to a polling booth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that they need to have handful after handful of how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> cards thrust into their hands by the representatives of all the various candidates and political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A real scrimmage takes place to be the last to put a how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> card into the hand of some elector, who is harassed on the way to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realise that there are farmers who like to be on their farms in the summer months working and getting the last ounce out of the daylight before they go to <span class="highlight">vote</span> between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest that, even if polling hours were extended beyond 8 o’clock at night, there would be some electors who would roll up at the last minute,  f  n my judgment and in my experience, after talking to many people, I say with conviction that there are very, very few people who could not manage to <span class="highlight">vote</span> between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. if those were the voting hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But 1 do not think, from my investigations and inquiries, that there would be a great many voters whose religious beliefs would preclude them from voting by 6 p.m. on Saturday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask him whether or not those who have religious beliefs and fall into the category that I have just described could perhaps be catered for with postal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it seems that the only genuine criticism that can be levelled against the preferential system is that a voter quite truthfully may claim that he has no preference for any of the candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A  Mr Little,  a barrister, took the matter to court when he was summonsed for not having cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noted that he was strangely quiet in regard to the one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he is consistent in his argument he must on his own premise argue that one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value is also stupid and unfair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind him that the policy of the Liberal Party in Queensland is to have one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I assume that it must also be the policy of the Liberal Part)’ in Canberra, if logic prevails, to have one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson)  said that if one agrees with that principle one must agree with the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value - that plaintive note we hear so often from the Opposition benches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other matter I want to speak about is this plaintive call of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let honourable members opposite call out “one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value’ now if they feel like it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have to get a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Senate before you can hold a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there was a referendum the people would <span class="highlight">vote</span> to leave the Senate where it is because a cry would go up that it is the greatest safeguard of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that the Senate votes on party lines although it was considered by those who drafted the Constitution that it should represent the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But senators <span class="highlight">vote</span> on party lines; they talk on party lines; they live on party lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So where is the one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value principle now? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am showing that the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value is false. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will some member of the Opposition who says that it is not explain later, if he has time, how 10 senators for 4.5 million people and 10 senators for 400,000 people is in keeping with the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have given enough figures to show the true merit of the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value is followed fairly closely in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 would ask that the Prime Minister should use another form of communication by himself to the 6 State Premiers asking them to expedite the legislation which all of them have promised to give votes and adult rights to men and women at. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 propose a method by which they can <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a national election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should not be denied that <span class="highlight">vote</span> any longer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One wishes he would put it to the test because the fact is that the majority of the members of this Parliament favour changes in the National Service Act; a majority of them favour the majority of the changes put forward by my  Deputy  to this Parliament early last year and which are again awaiting today a debate and <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is if there were a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this matter in this Parliament conscientious objection to the war in Vietnam would become the law of the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although 1 have not had the opportunity to deal adequately with what has been put forward - because of what the Opposition has tried to do in disrupting the debate and the lime of the House  -  I suggest that this might be an appropriate time at which to take a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Bills before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the reasons that I have already outlined, the Opposition proposes to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the 4 Bills before the House at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the bells ring and the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken on these measures, I would be very happy if he would sit with me in opposing thom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Angas who interjected just now spoke in this House on the tax and he indicated that he would <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But on a very careful examination of Hansard I see that he said he would only <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it if the industry were brought to its knees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He can <span class="highlight">vote</span> with us now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think he referred to this review when he spoke so forthrightly on the subject during the Budget debate, but now that he has shown his hand and is going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the measure he will not mention it at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">vote</span> against these Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Malaysia will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the important question but it will abstain from a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the actual recognition of Communist China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I intend to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it because we will have to see how it operates, but as long as it is not prevented from holding the amount of equity that it can hold we lay ourselves open in a way in which I do not think we should. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Otherwise - and I think this is more likely - the concern that the Government expressed for the low income groups was merely a smokescreen for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> catching gimmick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>in company with Portugal and the United Slates, <span class="highlight">vote</span> against United Nations resolution 2603A which opposed any chemical and biological agents used in war, and yet in resolution 2603 B voted for wider distribution of U Thant’s chemical and biological warfare report (A/7575); if so, why. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-48-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reasons for Australia’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> on resolution 2603A are contained in a reply to a question on notice (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-48-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, it was only last night in the Legislative Council of Victoria that a unanimous <span class="highlight">vote</span> of censure was carried against the Commonwealth Government for autocratically taking over the authority of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 have no doubt that the honourable member for Burke  (Mr Keith Johnson)  will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment moved by the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Kalgoorlie can regret, as he has done, the fact that the legislation has not been suspended pending the deputation which will be received by the Prime Minister on 21st October but the Government has decided, having regard to all the facts available, that this legislation should be pursued and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be taken tonight in advance of the submission which will be put to the Prime Minister on 21st October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>About 3 weeks ago the Labor Party had a Party meeting at which it was deadlocked in a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on whether there should even be a debate on rural matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Party is deadlocked in a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on whether there should be a debate on rural matters, how would it be if it was asked for millions of dollars for primary industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the House could better understand the pyrotechnical language of the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  if I were to acquaint it with the fact that within his electorate there is the largest Royal Australian Air Force base in Australia,  lt  is a matter of notoriety that the honourable member for Oxley gets his poorest <span class="highlight">vote</span> from the RAAF base at Amberley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Oxley, who has set out to try to retrieve that position and stir up goodwill, -came along this morning with a speech that I have not -the slightest doubt he started to prepare a week after the last election when he looked at the  results and saw that his <span class="highlight">vote</span> at Amberley was down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would prefer to  channel this money to meet more urgent needs in the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> and in the general Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On Wednesday last, the Minister for External Affairs, referring to Malaysia’s intentions regarding China’s admission to the United Nations, told the House that Malaysia would abstain from a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the actual recognition of Communist China, ls it a fact that Tun Ismael, the Malaysian Minister, stated on the 5th of this month that: ‘Malaysia would if necessary co-sponsor any move to admit China by a simple majority’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have voted against my Deputy’s motions to have parliamentary committees inquire into the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund and into (i) pay and allowances for all personnel, (ii) provision for retraining of officers and men, (iii) housing and (iv) educational facilities for the children of servicemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Realising the danger that the second <span class="highlight">vote</span> represented to him, the honourable member for Herbert  (Mr Bonnett)  gave notice of a motion to appoint such a committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only implication that can be drawn is that he would like to reduce the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> by$l00m and divert those funds to social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the 1950s and now in these times we have the Opposition coming out in true colours and suggesting that the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> should be cut and that defence moneys be spent on other internal domestic matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But if honourable members think that we live in the sort of world in which we can dramatically reduce the Australian defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> and at the same time maintain the sort of posture that we need, maintain the self-respect that we must have, and maintain an ability for our own defence which is essential for survival, then that is a nonsense proposition which I am sure will attract no support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would like to know whether the Leader of the Opposition will have the honesty in the next campaign or the one after that to get up and say: ‘It is our purpose to reduce the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>’ because if that were clearly stated in an election campaign - and it has been very clearly stated by the honourable member for St George - I suggest that it would very quickly lead to further defeat of the Labor Party at the polls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must make it quite clear thatI was quoting the very remarks of the honourable member for St George.I did not misrepresent what he said because the only example of alternative spending which he gave when he was talking about reducing the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> was to spend the money on social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to know, although 1 am not likely to be told and the House is not likely to be informed, why the Budget increases the proposed <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this body by about 13 per cent, which is a greater percentage increase than was accorded to the social welfare sector of the community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 point out to the honourable member, who now strides somewhat slowly into the chamber, that if he thinks that ought to apply so far as the Labor-held areas are concerned he should tell Liberal members such as the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Millhouse,  from Mitcham,  Dr Tonkin  who holds Bragg and  Mrs Steele  who holds Davenport to <span class="highlight">vote</span> as their electorates voted on the day of the referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I rise particularly in this debate on the States Grants (Aboriginal Advancement) Bill to seek some assurance from the Minister for Social Services and MinisterinCharge of Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Wentworth)  that we do not in fact <span class="highlight">vote</span> more money to the States and find that the States are doing effectively less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a member of the Legislative Assembly of the New South Parliament I voted - it was a pretty unanimous decision  -  to establish an all party committee to explore the problems, hopes and aspirations of Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This leads me to rise on this occasion specifically to support the amendment because I want to be clear in my mind that the money which will be voted and dispersed to the States will lead to more being done and not less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise this matter with full sincerity in the hope that we can in fact restore the facility that we had, restore programmes which have been dropped and that in fact this amount of money which the Federal Parliament is tonight being called upon to <span class="highlight">vote</span> will in fact go to a better programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why we expect that some people of conscience from the other side of the House who have been disinterested enough not to join in this debate may be tempted to come over here and to <span class="highlight">vote</span> with us to uphold the contentions of their own Liberal State Ministers so that this discriminatory legislation might be got rid of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Council considers this will fulfill a long felt want develop a pride of ownership and in so doing reduce the heavy overhead administration repair and maintenance costs and allow the initial <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be self recouping to sustain continuing home purchase programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then, in the Northern Territory money is being spent on Aboriginal housing both through my own Office and through the normal <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Department of the Interior, the latter being a larger sum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, of course, it was not rejected because of itself or what it contained, but it was rejected because the government of the day- a Liberal PartyCountry Party coalition, the same as we have at the present moment - which had taken office shortly before the expiration of the scheme imposed a 74 per cent levy to raise money to administer the scheme if the growers voted for it and also brought down a measure to deduct 20 per cent from the gross income of wool growers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-37-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the names of all honourable members who <span class="highlight">vote</span> in those divisions will be recorded according to the way in which they <span class="highlight">vote</span>, there will be no opportunity in the future for honourable members on the Government side to sympathise with pensioners in their electorates and then come here and work and <span class="highlight">vote</span> against them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is most unusual for an honourable member to introduce into this House a matter of public importance and then at the conclusion of his speech to move the suspension of Standing Orders in order to discuss the same matter but to bring the issue to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If everything happens as the Government intends it to happen, that is to say, if the majority of honourable members in this House do not <span class="highlight">vote</span> to suspend standing orders so that a decision can be made now - and 1 cannot understand why any honourable member on the Government side should refuse to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in support of this motion - the result will be that the standard of those in receipt of social service benefits will decline by at least another 50c in the next 6 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I challenge the right of the Liberal Party to have made this change in the Prime Ministership of Australia- The Liberal Party has the right to change its leader - I do not take that away from it - but, as a party of 46 in a House of 125 members and as a part of a coalition government of 66 members, the Liberals do not have the right to transfer a mandate gained by one leader to any other leader after a revolt within the ranks of their party - a revolt carried on the casting <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the person being overthrown and then only after the supreme cowardice of all members of the Liberal Party had been shown in a secret ballot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The members of the Liberal Party, who make up part of the coalition Government, did not have the courage to stand up in their own Party room and <span class="highlight">vote</span> out the man they wanted to <span class="highlight">vote</span>- out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liberal-Country Party Government obtained fewer votes in the 1969 House of Representatives elections and the 1970 Senate elections than did the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trie figures for the 1969 House of Representatives elections were as follows: The ALP under the leadership of  Mr Gough  Whitlam gained 2,870,792 votes or 46.95 per cent of the formal votes cast, and for that the Labor Party got 59 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party under the leadership of  Mr Gorton  and the  deputy  leadership of  Mr McMahon  gained 2,126,987 votes or 34.79 per cent of the formal votes, and for that .it got 46 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Country Party under the leadership of  Sir John  McEwen got 523,342 votes, 8.56 per cent of the formal votes, cast, and for that it got 20 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total LiberalCountry Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> was 2.650,329 votes or 43.35 per cent of the formal votes cast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Therefore on a strict party basis the Labor Party was 220,463 votes in front and received a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of 3.6 per cent better than the combined <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Liberal-Country Party, yet we have 7 fewer seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apparently some people in this place are to be given the axe just because they are not prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> the right way, to look the right way or to comb their hair the right way; no more than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Labor lost one seat by 85 votes, another by 120 votes and a third by a couple of hundred votes,’ even though on first preferences the Labor candidates had led their nearest opponents by anything from 800 to 1,500 votes! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However preferential voting applied and the votes of all the other candidates combined were sufficient to remove from Labor’s grasp seats which otherwise would have been held comfortably. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way it will ever succeed is by securing 65 per cent to 70 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> at 2 consecutive elections, so giving Labor a narrow margin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that Labor’s only hope, if preferential voting is not abandoned altogether, is for the Parliament of Western Australia - and I would hope other Parliaments in Australia - to accept optional preference voting whereby people would not be forced to record a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in order of preference for each candidate who is standing for election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they desired, they could <span class="highlight">vote</span> for one person, two persons or three right up to the total number of candidates which, in some instances in the last election, was 7. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the present system the Act requires that a preference shall be given to every candidate in order of preference except in the case of the last candidate where a number may be omitted and the <span class="highlight">vote</span> still be counted as formal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present the elector is obliged to cast his <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Votes are counted as though each elector has carefully weighed up in his mind the exact order in which he wants to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for all candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By this means we might diminish the value of the votes of such groups as the United Farmers and Graziers Association, whose candidates stood for the first time in Western Australia during the recent elections, and the Democratic Labor Party whose candidates contest most seats throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So I appeal to the Leader : of  the House to decide for himself or to bring to the consideration of the Government the question of making this matter, when raised on an amendment to the Bill ‘ proposed to be brought into the House, the subject of a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>.  ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that 65 per cent of the growers voted for it and about 35 per cent against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A statutory number of votes was required, not just a simple majority, so the stabilisation plan suggested by the Government on that occasion lapsed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is right to a certain extent, but it is right only in relation to that <span class="highlight">vote</span>, because certain people in the industry advised growers to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greatest trouble was the apathy of growers who thought that the proposal would be carried quite easily and did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it and so will have stabilisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mention was made of the stabilisation scheme and the fact that some of the growers failed to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this very important issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is well known why they did not <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We lost the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on that issue and it has now been accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While certain of the proposed amendments are formal or machinery in character and need little or no explanation, other provisions of the Bill seek to bring about much needed changes in the electoral law and it is to these that I will devote most of my remarks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed to extend the absent voting facilities on an Australiawide basis so that an elector who is outside the State or Territory for which he is enrolled may on polling day record an absent <span class="highlight">vote</span> at any polling booth open on that day anywhere in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, an elector who on polling day is outside the State for which he is enrolled must record a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> and, unless he has made a prior application, his only recourse is to attend at the office of a Divisional Returning Officer or the Returning Officer for the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in this day of extensive travel, many electors find themselves interstate on polling day, but without having made prior application for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> it is then often impossible to get to the office cf a Divisional Returning Officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A side effect of the proposed extension of absent voting will be an alteration to the grounds upon which an elector may make application for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, in order to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, non-ambulant patients must make an application for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> prior to polling day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the Victorian Senate election held on 26th November 1966, how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards obviously intended to mislead voters as to the political affiliation of certain candidates were printed and distributed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, pursuant to provisions contained in this Bill, it will be an illegal practice to print or distribute matter intended or likely to mislead voters, whether or not the offending document represents a ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government also proposes to insert a provision in the Act to enable candidates to take proceedings in the Supreme Court by way of an injunction to restrain the printing, publishing or distributing of any electoral advertisement, notice, handbill, pamphlet or card having thereon any directions intended or likely to mislead an elector, or containing any untrue or incorrect statement intended or likely to mislead or improperly interfere with an elector in relation to the casting of his <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under that provision, a person’s right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> shall be deemed to have been challenged if the Presiding Officer puts any of the prescribed questions to a voter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, under section 115 of the Act, the Presiding Officer must put some of the prescribed questions to every voter, thus the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> of every elector is deemed to have been challenged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The terms of the existing section 48 of the Referendum (Constitution Alteration) Act make it an offence to print, publish or distribute any advertisement or document containing a representation of a ballot paper, or any representation apparently intended to represent a ballot paper, having thereon any directions intended or likely to mislead an elector in relation to the casting of his <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a referendum, but it is not an offence where the adver tisement, etc., does not contain a representation of a ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only did the Minister for Social Services reject this argument, but when steps were taken on this side of the House for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to express an opinion as to whether the increases which we were proposing should be implemented, every honourable member on the Government side, from the Minister for Social Services and the Prime Minister down to the most junior backbencher, voted against the proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No electoral system in a country which claims to be democratic can justify making one person’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> only half as valuable as that of another person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The gerrymander by the Labor Government in Queensland when it was in office brought about a position in which the combined <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Liberal and Country Parties was 30,000 more than the Labor <span class="highlight">vote</span> yet they had 12 seats fewer than Labor in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If private members of the Liberal and Country Parties value their rights, if they are prepared to stand up for their constituents in what is as important a parliamentary activity as any other, question time, they will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this motion because the rights of everybody in this place, except those of the Prime Minister alone are in jeopardy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it incorporates the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value; secondly, it introduces the first past the post voting system; and thirdly, it provides that the order of candidates’ names on the ballot paper shall be decided by ballot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Pending this review of the Act, the Opposition proposes these three major amendments as the basis on which a democratic <span class="highlight">vote</span> may be registered by the people of Australia in the election of their government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These amendments will as far as possible give effect to the principal of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, with which I will deal in the time available to me at the Committee stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I now deal with the question of the first major proposal in the Bill, namely, one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subsequent redistribution of electorates in 1968 provided a striking illustration of the effect of these amendments, the disparity in electorate population and voting power and the complete negation of the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present other factors indicate that the application of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value may reduce the size of some electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if the whole population is included now that Aboriginals have a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, electorates like Kalgoorlie, Kennedy and Darwin will be reduced in size under the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a democratic society there can be no justification for a country storekeeper, a rural worker or an office worker having more value in his <span class="highlight">vote</span> than city persons in the same category have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer to the far flung country electorate is not to pervert the electoral system by making the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of country people two or three times more valuable than the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of metropolitan dwellers or to give them a weighted <span class="highlight">vote</span> but rather to provide their representatives with greater facilities, travel allowances, staff, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Country Parly has never polled more than 10.9 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span> at any House of Representatives election from 1949; yet it has invariably held anything from 15 to 20 seats in a House of 124, and 6 portfolios in a Ministry of between 20 and 25. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tn short, while polling only 10 per cent of the public <span class="highlight">vote</span> it exercises a parliamentary <span class="highlight">vote</span> of between 16 and 17 per cent and a ministerial influence of more than 20 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every worthwhile authority supports the case for one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Population is the basis on which boundaries should be decided because men, women and children of all ages and all nations present as many problems as those eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present system gives expression to the idea that only those eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span> are entitled to representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Contrary to some points of view expressed, it was opposed by the Labor Party led by  Mr Tudor,  the final <span class="highlight">vote</span> being 37 ayes, 10 noes and numerous pairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principal arguments advanced in support of preferential voting are, firstly, that it ensures that only a candidate who polls a majority of votes - that is more than 50 per cent - is elected, thus reflecting the majority view and, secondly, that it gives a voter the exercise of a preference or second choice on the basis that voters are concerned with who will actually win, even if their first choice is rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does it mean half the number of votes plus one or a majority for any of the candidates contesting the election? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>experience has shown that the system so applied permits the development of strong third parties and indeed the adoption of the alternative <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Australia has been largely due to the pressure of the Country Party for a method by which they could contest elections against older non-Labor parties without running the risk of putting the Labor Party into office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preferential voting has assisted both the Liberal and Country Parties to put up rival candidates without splitting the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and losing the seats to a common enemy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Party machine dictates the how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> card right down to the last preference and asks the citizen to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for its candidates according to the how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> card prepared by the Party executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, it may ensure that a constituency will elect a member with a majority of the final votes, but it does not ensure that the Party with the overall majority of the votes will obtain a majority of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not intend to go over all of the electorates but mention that in the seat of McMillan the Australian Labor Party candidate received 42.11 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Wimmera the Australian Labor Party candidate received 37.55 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet all these candidates were defeated by the minority <span class="highlight">vote</span> candidates as I mentioned a moment ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the simplest and most democratic method and gives to the elector the candidate of his choice without the complications of voting for candidates in order of preference in which the voter has no interest whatever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will prevent splinter groups or parties polling only a small percentage of the votes yet holding the electorate and the nation to ransom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘First past the post’ voting is not the be all and end all of democratic elections, but by the introduction of one-<span class="highlight">vote</span>-one-value and the introduction of this system it is reasonable to assume that governments elected will be those chosen by the majority and not, as Malcolm McKerras described this Government, as ‘a second preference government’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All candidates and all parties should therefore have an equal opportunity to this position, or the donkey <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the House to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the most ardent advocates of the one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value principle would recognise that exact equality of electorates is not feasible and could not be sensibly implemented at the expense of ignoring the features which have been long established as having a logical bearing on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they stand for the one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value principle their concern for the country should be taken for what it really is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party wants to restrict the Redistribution Commissioners to a 10 per cent variation of the quota when drawing boundaries, not taking, into account the numbers of electors in those constituencies but the population as a whole, including a lot of new Australians who are not yet naturalised and who have not yet got a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To introduce a one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value concept would accentuate this inequity of representation and service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would not be in the best interests of the people because the voters in the large areas today do not have the same privileges as those who live in the smaller electorates and who are closer to their representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what all honourable members are being asked to <span class="highlight">vote</span> upon today - to gag the voice of rural Australia in a time of great difficulty and to disfranchise the hundreds of thousands of people in city and country areas who have the temerity to prefer policies other than those that are espoused by the Liberal-Country Parties and the Labor Party itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, this is what it is all about: We want a system of government in Australia in which the people get the government for which they <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaving that aside, I believe that when people, at the ballot box, clearly <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a Party and give that Party a clear majority that is the Party that is entitled to be elected to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe in getting as close as we can to the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see this position very much better if we consider the situation in Queensland at the moment where members of the Liberal Party, to their great credit, have crossed the floor of the Queensland Legislative Assembly to <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Australian Labor Party to secure a democratic redistribution in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have asked for one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value or as close as we can get to that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely people are entitled to representation by the parties for which they <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and that is the purpose behind this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not matter whether that money is being spent on something else, whether it be a defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> of $ 1,100m or SI, 200m a year - and not so many years ago the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> was about one-fifth of that amount - or whether it be on particular aspects of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> such as the purchase of Fill aircraft or of guided missile destroyers from America at 4 times the price at which they could be made here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the only way it can be proved is by the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those who <span class="highlight">vote</span> against our proposition will be making it perfectly clear that, as far as they are concerned, the increase of 50c given to the pensioners on this occasion is as much as they deserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again the result of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> will show what honourable members generally consider in regard to the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Anyone who votes against our proposition will be making it clear that in his mind the amounts being received by social services recipients are quite sufficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, again, the tone of the contributions to the debate from the Government side causes us some concern, and we will await with interest the outcome of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> before being sure whether members of the Government parties really want to eliminate the poverty and suffering that occur in some areas of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister must <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it unless he is only a sham fighter because, as those of us who have been around this place for some time remember very well, when he was a backbencher he used to be on his feet every second night speaking in adjournment debates and advocating the abolition of the means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I caution honourable members and seek them to give thoughtful consideration  -  I stress the words ‘thoughtful consideration’ - before they decide how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Doing that and readily subscribing to that invitation from the honourable member for Reid, I ask myself what is the principle that a member of this House should operate upon in determining for himself whether he should <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the disallowance of these ordinances, and I should have thought it was fairly clear in view of the fact that the motion came from the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All I want to say to the honourable member is that he voted for these measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before an elector could <span class="highlight">vote</span> as an ordinary voter at any polling booth in the Division for which he is enrolled, it would be necessary to equip each polling both in the Division with a full Division roll brought up-to-date with the official roll for use as the Certified List. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So what are people who have no <span class="highlight">vote</span> to do? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government will not let them <span class="highlight">vote</span> and it will not let them have a say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important that we have demonstrations if by the word ‘demonstration’ we mean something by which people can show that they feel strongly about certain issues and are prepared to do more than merely <span class="highlight">vote</span> once every 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Commission, (c) Australia has not first sought, as required by the United Nations Charter,  all  possible peaceful means of settlement which include asking  all  powers involved to sign the Accords and to petition and submit all matters in dispute to the determinations of the International Control Commission, the International Court of Justice and United Nations instrumentalities and (d) there are reasonable grounds for presumptions that the Thieu Government came to power in Saigon due to massive foreign aid and maintains power by corrupt procedures and the Lon Nol faction threatened certain key members of the Cambodian Parliament to obtain a near unanimous <span class="highlight">vote</span> ousting Sihanouk to offset his increasing international support, will he publish refutations in answer to these claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-50-6">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I treat it seriously because it is quite different from moving a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence in a Minister, who represents a part of the government, or in the government itself, because what is on trial is not the Minister but really the portfolio which he represents and administers or the government itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence is moved in you,  Sir, it  is moved against a person because you have made deliberate personal decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, whether you like it or not, or whether we like it or not, the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence is directed at you personally, and the Opposition has not done this without giving it serious thought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Barnard)  referred to the notorious occasion when the Opposition moved a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence in the Government and you accepted an amendment which was a direct negative of the motion, thus defying every rule of debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If honourable members <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders which will enable that simple thing to be done, all I can say is that they are easily satisfied and that the public outside will consider that they are easily satisfied too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It could well happen because on most occasions when the Standing Orders are before the House and amendments are proposed a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> is granted to honourable members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Debate on this Bill is long overdue: Is the reason why the Government does not bring this Bill on for debate because the Government wishes to continue with the present electoral set up in Australia which favours a system which elects to this Parliament 22 members of 1 Party which, at the last Federal election, across the length and breadth of the Commonwealth, polled less than 8 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that honourable members will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the suspension of Standing Orders so that we can consider each one of these Bills, whether they are urgent or not, in order to get down to the urgent business of determining for how long and by what process the debate will ensue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government does not dare hold a referendum on Bougainville because, and I say this definitely, it would get  i  97 per cent <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of secession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that would get the number of educated men info the House who might have some contribution to make from that point of view, but as we also believe that this is really resting on a form of illusion we intend to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My reason for moving for the suspension of the Standing Orders is that I want to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue, as I said before, to test the members of the Country Party, to see how genuine they are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a trick for the simple reason that although members of the Labor Party represent a certain amount of primary industry areas, the <span class="highlight">vote</span> they get comes from a densely populated area within the electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the <span class="highlight">vote</span> that Labor candidates obtain comes from the densely populated areas that are contained within the electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said in his second reading speech that it is, but nothing that has been said - it is mostly nothing -  by honourable members on the other side of the House so far has given us any confidence that that is true, and until we have a better case to justify the provision of funds such as provided under this Bill I submit that the House must <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-35">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that this is not strictly a no confidence motion, nor in fact has the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  accepted it as such, it would have been futile to move a no confidence motion because the many Ministers who have been displaced by the right honourable gentleman have all stated that they will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of a no confidence motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710817_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From now on a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for McMahon is a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for placing the control of the country in the hands of a multi-millionaire Press baron who will have power without responsibility, which has been the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710817_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since it is very difficult for the Treasury to devote consideration to this question - my proposition concerns similar schemes in New Zealand and the United States of America - I think it is one upon which we should have, with advantage, a joint parliamentary committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, I believe that the proposals by the Senate should be considered very seriously by this House and then debated and a determination made by way of a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was not endorsed at all by the majority <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a couple of States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They would have been able to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for 4 years before they were called up, and they would have wives who could object. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again, 1 believe the Minister could have made some explanation of the difficulties which have appeared in the South Pacific Commission over the weighted <span class="highlight">vote</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia has 5 votes whereas most countries of the South Pacific Commission - the new ones certainly - have only one <span class="highlight">vote</span> each. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite the present Minister to allow a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be taken on this matter, which has been outstanding for nearly 4 months on the notice paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To admit Taiwan to the United Nations it will be necessary to secure a two-thirds <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the General Assembly as well as the sanction of the Security Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Sun-Times said that President Kennedy deepened his commitment to a non-Communist South Vietnam despite a report by Charles  Maechling,  chairman of a special committee that: If free elections were to be held in South Vietnam in 1962, Ho Chi Minh would get 70 per cent of the popular <span class="highlight">vote</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that the Government is changing face and is going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for China’s admission to the United Nations, but I think it has left its run too late, because the Chinese realise, and they state, that we have been the puppets of the United States for too long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He might remember that the honourable member for Angas  (Mr Giles),  who voted in favour of the excise and who then said that if it was hurtful to the industry he would <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it, had asked him what progress the Government’s committee was making, lt might be remembered that the Government committee was set up to examine the effects of the wine excise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member says that we are bound by caucus decisions; that we are bound to <span class="highlight">vote</span> as the Party tells us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These men who can <span class="highlight">vote</span> as they like, do what they like, speak as they like, of course as long as they do not <span class="highlight">vote</span> the Government out, sat there silently and swallowed the words they had uttered all the week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is more, they say that the Prime Minister has not got a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They try to kid themselves that the are something special but when the crunch comes they <span class="highlight">vote</span> as they are told. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I leave aside the propriety of making such an announcement before the House has been given an opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the motion moved by the honourable member for Grayndler on 4th May last, disapproving of the decision to appoint Assistant Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us see the constitutional position and let us see how honourable members with their sense of responsibility are prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the motion I have put forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the debate was adjourned in May, it appeared that there were members on the Government side who, for once, would have voted against what they thought was an unconstitutional procedure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now the Prime Minister is seeking to avoid a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought to suspend the Standing Orders because before we do anything about finalising the appointment of these Assistant Ministers, we must clear the decks and ascertain whether the Prime Minister has the right constitutionally to do this, and I think that for that reason we should now suspend the Standing Orders and we should take a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on whether what is proposed is valid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is another example of the Party’s refusal to accept his dictates whenever there can be a private <span class="highlight">vote</span> on anything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>J do not think it is for this House to express by a <span class="highlight">vote</span> any disapproval of the decision that the Prime Minister, as head of the Government, has made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the question now before the House for the reason that I desired to draw the attention of this House to the need for a guide to action in such cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without legal training one has to depend largely on the advice of experts, but as one opinion offset the other I decided that it was not in the best interests of justice that I <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the Government is concerned honourable members on this side are free to <span class="highlight">vote</span> as they wish, just as they were on the previous occasion when a similar amendment was proposed to the Standing Orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason J was pleased to hear the Leader of the House indicate that this matter would be the subject of a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>, not only by members from his side of the chamber, but naturally, also by members of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Admission of Taiwan, as sought by the US and Australian Governments, would require Security Council approval and a two-thirds <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the General Assembly which in his opinion could not be mustered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know, as Lord Trevelyan said, that their system, the new 2-China policy, would have to get a two-third majority <span class="highlight">vote</span> in order to be accepted, and that this is an impossibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should realise that Singapore, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma - all of them - <span class="highlight">vote</span> against us on these Chinese issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure he would agree that never was there so much drama, never such an intense atmosphere, as existed for a couple of weeks prior to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> being taken on whether Communist China should be admitted to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year when the honourable member for Bonython and I were at the United Nations the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the proposal for the admission of the People’s Republic of China was 51 in favour, 49 against and 25 abstentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that in 1969 the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was 48 in favour, 56 against and 21 abstentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the proposal that the subject be regarded as an important question the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was 66 in favour, 52 against and 7 abstentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One rather felt that this would flow over into 1971 and that many of those who had abstained in 1970 no doubt would be faced with this proposition: Should they <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the admittance of Communist China to the exclusion of Taiwan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who knows - they may <span class="highlight">vote</span> overwhelmingly to join the People’s Republic of China and save us the difficult choice which we are left with in deciding whether to continue with the policy that this Government has perpetrated to date, that there is only one China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Treasurer advise me whether expenditure in relation to the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund is deducted from the Defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should expenditure for the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund be deducted from the Defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My recollection is that the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund expenditure is included in the totality of the Defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention today that the change in sitting hours was made in the nature of an experiment when a number of standing orders were overhauled, and with the best of intentions members, who were free to <span class="highlight">vote</span> as they wished, voted on this matter in a way that they thought would benefit the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I think it is fair that honourable members should hear what I propose before they <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the honourable member could have been saying that let me say that, if honourable members took responsibility, were prepared to play a greater part in the debates and perhaps to <span class="highlight">vote</span> according to their conscience and for matters of principle and to see this Parliament work, this without any doubt would be the most important part of a parliamentarians life and work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though the matter of trying the experiment, which is about to be abandoned, was carried on a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> last year, immediately a considerable number of people opposed any suggestion that the new system, the experiment as it has now been called, could work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that the majority, as my colleague the honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron)  pointed out, do come from the Sydney-Melbourne axis and it grieves me a little to find that a couple of people who suggested to the Government Members Committee that there might be a weighted <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of those people who come here from far distant places were ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Education is one area which must not be allowed to degenerate as it has in the past until it has become a political instrument for buying votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need imaginative action over and above the personal ambitions of Government members, above <span class="highlight">vote</span> catching measures ia election years and above party politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">vote</span> of $ 1,252.4m has been allocated to this Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I feel sure that honourable members will agree with the increased <span class="highlight">vote</span> in defence expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reject this amendment out of hand, as I am sure the Government will do when a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Following upon my correspondence with him regarding the rights of 18 to 20-year-old persons to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Federal elections under section 41 of the Constitution, what is the reason for the Government’s refusal to allow 18 to 20-year-old persons to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Federal elections in States where they have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for their State parliaments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After this decision has been made, of course, the legislation will be introduced into this House and honourable members will be able to debate it and <span class="highlight">vote</span> upon it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When (he Standing Orders Committee was discussing this matter 1 said that if it wanted my opinion on the different proposals it should look at Hansard to see how I voted when the matter was before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have some admiration, shall 1 say, for the honourable member for Banks for bringing forward an amendment which he thinks is a good one but I do not think it is good and naturally I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this amendment for the reasons put forward by the honourable member for Mallee  (Mr Turnbull)  which I felt were sound reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their wishes will be enforced, because honourable members will <span class="highlight">vote</span> and naturally the majority <span class="highlight">vote</span> will carry the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However they <span class="highlight">vote</span> will determine the question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He wants to get from them the feeling which will help him in his <span class="highlight">vote</span> and his conduct in the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is important and I would not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the 3-day week if we were not assured of spending more time here to deal with the legislation which, as I have said, has trebled in quantity in the last 20-odd years and in many respects is more important, too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the 3- day week hoping, firstly, that there will be no sitting past midnight because if this happens we will cause trouble using the Standing Orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But here again, I should not let this influence the way in which I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Wilmot  (Mr Duthie)  told us why he will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment, and I can see his view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will support the Committee’s recommendation and <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the amendment on the understanding that we will sit for more weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However the amount to be advanced to Qantas exceeds the increase in that particular <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I exempt the honourable member for Eden-Monaro  (Mr Allan Fraser)  from this criticism because if the report of a radio broadcast of his as printed in the Melbourne ‘Sun’ of 23rd August is correct he will oppose this means test provision and <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know that the honourable member for Angas is most anxious to have this matter brought before the House and voted upon but the effect of the motion that is now being debated is that he will be effectively silenced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Surely we should not put him in the position where he is voting- if we did have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it; 1 think it is a measure of the sweet charity on the part of the Opposition that we are nol voting upon it - to gag himself because of tradition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It used to be traditional not to give people a <span class="highlight">vote</span> if they did not have enough property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was a wideranging debate in the Press on the size of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> and what cuts would be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Treasurer’s comments on the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> are lacking in illumination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was confined to a statement of the total defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> and the amount to be spent on new capital equipment and works, a quick run through of items of equipment to be delivered this year, and passing references to Cockburn Sound, Learmonth Airfield and defence aid programmes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer said that the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> proposed for 1971-72 was $ 1,252.4m, an increase of $11 7m or 10.3 per cent more than the previous year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a proportion of Government spending this year’s defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> is much the same as in 1970- 71. in real terms defence spending has shown little significant variation in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Analysis of the various components of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> is much the same as in 1970- concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the total defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> is kept at its present percentage of the national income this allocation is unlikely to fall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If concepts of job values in the Services are recast then additional increases in pay rates are inevitable, lt is difficult to see pay, allowances and other benefits for servicemen absorbing less than a third of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the next few years, allowing for the recommendations of the Kerr <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This amounts to $177m or about 14 per cent of the total defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In total, paying servicemen and giving them appropriate equipment account for less than half of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> of this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government contribution to the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund is excluded, the remaining half of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> is soaked up by the extremely long administrative tail of our defence structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Provision for new equipment in the Budget is revealed under several items of the statement for the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total provision for new equipment for the 3 Services is $177m or about 14 per cent of the total defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The amount allocated for new production and procurement amounts to 14 per cent pf the total defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a proportion of the gross national product, the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Budget is less than it is in countries such as Britain, Sweden, West Germany and Norway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Undoubtedly a defence system which sops up half of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> in non-Service salaries and administrative costs is not operating at peak efficiency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On a rough comparative basis Britain allots 28 per cent of defence spending to Service pay compared with 32 per cent ot the Australian <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The British Budget devotes 36 per cent of spending to civilian pay, administrative services, stores and supplies compared with around SO per cent in the Australian defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless economies of the order of at least 10 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span> can be made in these costs, then the squeeze will stay on Service pay rates or re-equipment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have no doubt that neither of them will ever <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Government on the most simple matter or the most simple amendment: they will continue to wring their hands until we ring them out of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a matter which I think every honourable member would support if he had a a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I was very disappointed indeed today to see every Government supporter <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the move by the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  to set up a select committee of this Parliament to inquire into the best means of establishing a national superannuation scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is regrettable that the Government saw fit a short time ago to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders in order to allow the setting up of a committee to inquire into social welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that for once in a way we will see that Liberal independence whereby honourable members opposite can <span class="highlight">vote</span> as they like - cross the floor and say anything - and nothing will happen to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For once, let them cast an intelligent <span class="highlight">vote</span> and support the Opposition’s amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have tried to look at this in humane terms and not in the way that the Labor Party looks at it - purely in terms of <span class="highlight">vote</span> getting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party has said that children have not got votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> strongly in support of the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He agrees in principle with what we from this side of the House say but, of course, the last thing he will do is <span class="highlight">vote</span> for our amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that these increased charges will not be imposed, but I am doubtful that the Government will alter its attitude now, as a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is to be taken on this measure very shortly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I did read a statement that  Mr Ali  Bhutto had informed  President  Yahya Khan that his party would not be prepared to accept an enforced solution which deprived the people of their right to- <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a properly conducted democratic election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no doubt that the result of the introduction of one man one <span class="highlight">vote</span> in South Africa would result in immediate black rule for that country and many fear that this would be followed by inter-racial slaughter and inter-tribal slaughter, such as has happened in the Congo, Biafra and other African countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the Commission constituted by not less than 3 members nominated by the  President  (at least one of whom is a presidential member of the Commission) thinks that the views of the members, or of a section or class of the members, of the organization or of a branch of the organization upon a matter ought to be ascertained with a view to assisting the prevention or settlement of the dispute, the Commission so constituted may order that that matter be submitted to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of those members, or of the members of that section or class taken by secret ballot (with or without provision for absent voting) in accordance with directions given by the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is one occasion on which honourable members from both sides of the chamber would be happy, I am sure, to <span class="highlight">vote</span> unanimously for a military operation, and I would hope that perhaps this might be possible in view of the threat to the entire economy in vital regions of both States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one looks at the cost of the superannuation component which is paid by the Commonwealth - this does not include the PostmasterGeneral’s Department and other authorities - it will be found that $5 1.7m is paid from the Treasury <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  or his Department tell me why it is that the cost of superannuation for members of the Departments of Trade and Industry, Civil Aviation and other departments should not come out of the direct <span class="highlight">vote</span> of those departments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 find it rather extraordinary that while the Opposition were not prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the motion for the second reading of the National Service Bill it is prepared to move an amendment in the committee stage which if adopted would virtually abolish the need for this Bill altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why do honourable members not get together, sit in this House and find out what is going on instead of rushing in when there is a division with the call ‘What is the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But if one asks what should the real purpose of the Opposition be, surely it is to try to change the ideas of the Government and to effect real improvements in legislation, though, with public debating and the electorate outside eventually judging the protagonists by means of a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, it inevitably means that the public performance must appear not to allow the Opposition any influence on the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a matter of fact I do not think any State would carry it by referendum and as the honourable member would be aware, if he is at all knowledgeable in regard to the Constitution, the Senate can be abolished only by a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the 6 States with a complete majority in each State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Mitchell who has just left the chamber had his seat gerrymandered for pre-selec- tion purposes within the framework of the Liberal Party in the last few weeks, changing it to a city electorate from a country electorate so that he would get the block <span class="highlight">vote</span> from the Liberal Party Executive in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken at the United Nations General Assembly on Monday - they are 15 hours behind us - first on the question whether priority should be accorded to the non-expulsion resolution which Australia and 21 other countries were co-sponsoring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Albanian resoluion no <span class="highlight">vote</span> will now be taken on the dual representation resolution of which Australia was also co-sponsor with 18 other countries, and which in its terms would have provided for the representation of the People’s Republic of China and its taking the seat on the Security Council and would also have provided for the continued representation of the Republic of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt is possible this did have an effect on some of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the important question motion, which we co-sponsored, and which got priority over the Albanian motion for a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, it was provided, as honourable members will recall, that any motion which would invovle the expulsion of any member would be an important question requiring a two-thirds majority to pass. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was going against that important question motion there was, one could say, a movement of votes during the course of this debate on Monday night in the United Nations to join those who were voting in favour of the Albanian motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has put another reason why it might be necessary to suspend the 11 o’clock rule and that is that if we are having a cognate debate on certain Bills and we then need to have separate votes we might have to defer till the following day the votes on any of the Bills which had not gone through before 11 o’clock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no reason whatever, in view of the instances that he has given of Opposition collaboration, for him to believe that in those circumstances the Opposition would not agree to the <span class="highlight">vote</span> being taken on the remaining Bills upon which debate had concluded after 11 o’clock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I said to the Acting Prime Minister at that time, the Forrest electorate is ideally suited for testing out policies of decentralisation because it will not affect the Country Party <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It secures only 10 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the area as it is, so it is one area where we can get down to the serious work of ascertaining what can be done by way of decentralisation without affecting Country Party representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a member of the United Nations we should not be prepared to stand by and see another member of that body so recklessly abandoning all the principles which are sacrosanct and sacred, and that is of course that a party with a philosophy which obtains an overwhelming <span class="highlight">vote</span> from the peoples should be entitled to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is an occasion when we should have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> unless the Government lacks the intestinal fortitude to allow its supporters to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the matter and when an expression of opinion of this Parliament should be forthcoming on this matter which is one of conscience for every member of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No adult person who has or acquires a right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at elections for the more numerous House of the Parliament of a State shall, while the right continues, be prevented by any law of the Commonwealth from voting at elections for either House of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Now 1 am sure that you would have expected that, under that provision of the Constitution, 18 to 20-year-olds in Western Australia would be entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a Federal election and that 18 to 20-year- olds in New South Wales, South Australia and other States, when legislation was introduced to provide to those people the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in elections in those States, would similarly be entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a Federal election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of that provision and because in Western Australia the right of this age group to <span class="highlight">vote</span> had been exercised in a State election, I wrote to the Minister for the Interior  (Mr Hunt)  on 29th June. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked him what instructions had been issued by his Department to chief electoral officers in each of the States in which the voting age had been lowered to facilitate the enrolment of those newly eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked, finally, what advice should be given to inquiring 18 to 20-year-olds in Western Australia who had the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the more numerous House in that State and whether the Federal Government was intending to extend the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> to all 18 to 20-year-olds across Australia, as was promised by the right honourable member for Higgins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As that provision is in the Constitution I contacted the Minister’s Department again to find out what it intended to do about this matter because I believe that the provision was clearly there for these people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at Federal elections since they had the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at State elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason was the word adult’ in the provision that no adult person who has or acquires a right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at elections for the more numerous House of the Parliament of a State shall be prevented from voting at Federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was careful to mention that so that he would know that this was something on which he had given me a decision and also because he has a facility for remembering correspondence from members on the Country Party benches - regarding the rights of 18 to 20-year-old persons to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Federal elections under section 41 of the Constitution, what is the reason for the Government’s refusal . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had been told that it had refused - to allow 18 to 20-year-old persons to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Federal elections in States where they have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for their State parliaments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the reason for the Government’s decision to withhold the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> from persons 18 to 20 years old when they have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in State elections in certain States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the refusal of the Government to give 18 year olds a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is a further indication of the Liberal-Country Party’s desire to restrict the franchise at the federal level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think the reasons for this must be that the Liberal-Country Party saw that the first election in which 18 to 20 year olds voted resulted in a Labor government being returned in Western Australia and it has associated those 2 facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those elections in the metropolitan area the Labor Party received 149,094 votes for which it received 2 seats; the Liberal Party received 78,701 votes for which it received 3 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the agriculture, mining and pastoral areas the Labor Party with 63,698 votes received 1 seat, the Liberal Party with 43,868 votes received 5 seats and the Country Party with 25,035 votes received 2 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the decision made by the Minister for the Interior  (Mr Hunt)  with regard to 18 to 20-year olds in Western Australia, where they have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and where they ought to have it under section 41 of the Constitution, in refusing to introduce legislation to operate throughout the Commonwealth is a clear indication of the desire of this Government to restrict the franchise as far as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of 3,745 growers of sultanas, raisins and currants, who registered to <span class="highlight">vote</span> only 2,437 voted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of those voting therefore 65 per cent favoured the plan but since the citerion for the acceptance of the plan was that there should be a majority of those eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and since those who <span class="highlight">vote</span> ‘yes’ represented only 42 per cent of all eligible voters, no mandate for the plan was in effect given to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This can of course be regarded only as a matter of personal judgment but it might well be argued that the overwhelming ‘yes’ <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the recent referendum, held only 18 months after the earlier poll, does give support to this viewpoint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As 1 read this biography, and I will read it to the House shortly but not at great length, it seems to me to be the sort of public relations exercise which might be produced not for the Prime Minister of Australia but for somebody like the Imam of Oman or the  President  of the- Maldive Islands at the United Nations, if he had turned up to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they are sincere and <span class="highlight">vote</span> as only Liberal members can <span class="highlight">vote</span>, so we are told - as their conscience dictates; they are not tied to the Party line - there is no other course for them to adopt but to cross the floor and <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We on this side of the Parliament are particularly interested in the remarks of the former Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Higgins  (Mr Gorton),  who said when he was Prime Minister that 18-year-olds would have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the next Federal election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders everybody in this Parliament will know exactly what sort of people they are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This motion from this side of the House comes more in a desire to let Government supporters exercise their freedom and right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on an issue about which they say they are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is true that Government supporters have views on this matter and they can <span class="highlight">vote</span> as they wish, what a splendid opportunity they have to exercise that tolerant and democratic process about which the honourable member for Murray  (Mr Lloyd)  spoke when he said that an honourable member was entitled to move such a motion as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having looked at the Hansard record, which is full of their names as having voted for the excise, I thought that they had repented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not intend to offend the honourable member but this is an excellent opportunity for him to let the House know how he will <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would like to see them particularly give expression to an intelligent <span class="highlight">vote</span> for once by voting for Labor policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion is to suspend Standing Orders so that we proceed to debate this measure until a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken and we know precisely where all members of the Parliament stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us all <span class="highlight">vote</span> as a united parliament to see that justice is given to those who produce this great and spiritual product, wine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In what way would the passing of this motion, with acclamation and a unanimous <span class="highlight">vote</span> of this House, embarrass the Labor Party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are paying credit to the men of the Royal Australian Navy who served in the Vietnam theatre, and to the members of the Australian Regular Army, the national servicemen, the members of the Royal Australian Air Force and the nursing sisters who served in that area, lt is to them and to them alone that this Parliament on behalf of the people of Australia, whichever way they <span class="highlight">vote</span>, is giving credit and thanks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely honourable members on the other side of the House, particularly those from New South Wales such as the honourable member for North Sydney  (Mr Graham),  who served with the forces and wears his Ail Force badge with great pride, should stand up and <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Opposition on this issue and on the amendment which will bo moved later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the honourable member for Mitchell  (Mr Irwin),  who is a great war horse, a great man for blood and guts in war, a great supporter of the Vietnam war and the sending of our boys overseas, should <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to see them <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that, on this occasion, even honourable members on the Government side will <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Opposition to support my amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that those honourable members on the Government side who wear their RSL badges with pride will at least <span class="highlight">vote</span> with us to support our amendment seeking to increase the value of the war service homes loan to $15,000 so that the people in New South Wales to whom I have referred - and New South Wales is the most populous State of the Commonwealth - will be not only assisted to obtain a home but will be able to acquire a dwelling and so live with some security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the other context it is a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of gratitude, a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of thanks to the servicemen for the service they gave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I forget the figure he used but it was probably a bit less than the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment refers to servicemen wherever they have been engaged and whatever they have done, lt is widening the scope of the Bill so incredibly that I could not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was tempted to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment, and I went to my Whip and said: ‘I am tempted to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment, but I have to read what they have actually said in the amendment’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that we will have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this amendment in a short time, it seems that we will have the support of at least 2 Government supporters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to make clear what I am prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment to insert the words ‘serving member of the forces’ if by definition that phrase includes a member of the militia who joins tomorrow, or who joined a month ago, and who does one days service a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I often hear people say, ‘Why do not you teach the youngsters in your schools all about politics and about how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> so that we can cut down on the great number of informal votes at election times?’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the Opposition gives to those 2 gallant honourable gentlemen the opportunity to do the right thing and <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711130_reps_27_hor75/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are asking them now to come across and <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711130_reps_27_hor75/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both honourable members can <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this amendment and give an opportunity for serving members of the regular forces to be given this war service loan to which they are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711130_reps_27_hor75/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ask both honourable members for the sake of their reputations to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711130_reps_27_hor75/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The degree of that insincerity can be seen by the fact that members of the Opposition are getting up and asking people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the House and taunting them because they do not <span class="highlight">vote</span> when, as a matter of fact, they need not <span class="highlight">vote</span> because they have got what they wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711130_reps_27_hor75/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet these same people are themselves always bound by a Caucus decision and know very well that they would be expelled from their Party if they voted in this House against a Caucus decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711130_reps_27_hor75/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they put down an amendment which takes in specifically those who went into the Vietnam area, we will see whether they will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711130_reps_27_hor75/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member for Dawson suggests that I will cross the floor and <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this amendment, he is quite wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711130_reps_27_hor75/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have hoped that there would be more honourable gentlemen disposed to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for such a proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711130_reps_27_hor75/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are asking honourable members opposite to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for our amendment to increase the loan from $9,000 to $15,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711130_reps_27_hor75/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government were to give votes to 18-year-olds, 19-year-olds and 20- year-olds, there is no question how those who are still in the country would <span class="highlight">vote</span> because they are the people who cannot get jobs and who therefore go to the cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a clear point but it should be understood because it is a comprehension of that very basic point that honourable members would need to understand to decide how they should <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were inserted after due consideration and by a clear and decisive <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time and again in this Parliament when we have put this matter to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> the members of the Australian Country Party in particular have voted against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have little doubt that the Country Party will again follow that course of action and <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this amendment despite the fact that this is what the wool industry wants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have no doubt that some of the members of the Country Party who will get up to speak on this Bill will do exactly as they did in regard to the Bill which imposed the excise duty on wine; they will argue one way and <span class="highlight">vote</span> the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition will support and <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this Bill but I shall make some comment which I hope the Government will note because when another Bill is introduced next year, the year after or whenever it becomes necessary to readjust the salaries of these statutory offices the Opposition will, I hope, take the same note of what I think are shortcomings in the presentation of this Bill and will expect the government of the day, if it does not do it without prodding by the then Opposition, to see that a clear statement is given of the existing salaries compared with the proposed salaries so that the Parliament will have an idea of what actually has occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if highlanders are to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for what they think is in their best interests - and they are entitled to think that - but say that self-government will not be given to other areas until they are ready for it, then the Government has a real crisis on its hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with industry leaders who maintain that if that same referendum had been put to the same growers a few weeks after the first <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken, there would have been an overwhelming <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of stabilisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He spoke with the growers who at that stage voted in favour of the stabilisation scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of 3,745 growers of sultanas, raisins and currants who registered to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, only 2,437 voted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of these, 1,578 voted yes and 859 voted no. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of those voting, 65 per cent favoured the plan, but since the criterion for acceptance of the plan was that there should be a majority of those eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of it and because those who voted yes represented only 42 per cent of all eligible voters, no mandate for the plan was given to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just recently another stabilisation <span class="highlight">vote</span> has been taken and early in August this year over 350 growers from Sunraysia and the Riverland area heard the Minister for Primary Industry, whom I invited to visit Mildura, explain that the plan was the best arrangement within the funds available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister urged all growers eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the referendum on the plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the 5,004 growers enrolled, 4,616 or 92 per cent cast their votes and of this number 4,560 or 98 per cent voted in favour of the scheme offered by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will notice that the number of growers registered to <span class="highlight">vote</span> increased tremendously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of the scheme was such a good one that the Government is now implementing the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Opposition’s amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime 1 point out to the House that no-one should be fooled by the claim of the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair),  in his second reading speech, that the growers voted overwhelmingly in favour of the plan, because it was offered on a this or nothing’ basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other honourable members who have spoken made  a  great play of the percentage of growers who voted in favour of the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’ is only natural that if a person is going to get nothing else he has to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that all the growers who voted for this scheme knew it would only keep them on the farm a little longer, but that it would give them no hope of surviving economically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw in this Parliament last year a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of censure on the previous Prime Minister on this very question - a matter of great urgency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether I can cajole, threaten, persuade, encourage, lead or mislead 5 or 6 members to cross the floor of the House to <span class="highlight">vote</span> with him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter which, if people have views on it, I should like to see debated in this Parliament and voted on in this Parliament with a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely if ever there was a matter which should be so voted on, it is this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the suspension of Standing Orders and to take the business out of the hands of the Government at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I noted that there was no nodding of the head by the Minister for National Development in response to the appeals of the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  and I think therefore that the Minister and all concerned should know that if it appears that this Bill is not ever going to be brought on in this Parliament, as it was promised that it would be, then I will cast whatever <span class="highlight">vote</span> is open to me to cast to endeavour to see that it is brought on, debated and passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The procedures of this House with its so called ‘gag’ and ‘guillotine’ procedures, the time limits imposed on members and the tendency for honourable members to <span class="highlight">vote</span> almost invariably on party lines on many issues make it impossible to debate a code as extensive as this, a code that has something like 226 sections in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The danger is that these makers will be presented and there will be no opportunity for honourable members lo consider the provisions adequately or <span class="highlight">vote</span> on non-party lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event, if we have a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>, there will still be this tendency to be infected, if I may use that word in a very gentle sense, with certain prejudices which might be inimical to the development of the best decisions on law reform when we debate this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole problem seems to be that the Prime Minister is worried about having to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the House on the matter because he might have lo express his own personal view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister may succeed in fooling himself into believing that strike ballots are all that are needed to stop or settle disputes, but non-one wilh a knowledge of the facts will gainsay that a compulsory strike ballot would almost invariably produce an affirmative <span class="highlight">vote</span> for strike action- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But what happens when employees <span class="highlight">vote</span> for strike action? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does it not realise that the existing rules of the Bus Employees Union allow members to demand a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of all members whenever it is asked for? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does it not realise that, in fact, this is exactly what happened on 29th November when, in response to a petition of only a handful of members for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in order to test the wishes of the rest of the union, the unions members voted 3,440 to 12 in, favour of refusing to operate one-man buses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From his interjections we on this side of the House could be sure of his <span class="highlight">vote</span> in support of the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that this is an abdication of responsibility on the part of the Commonwealth because if the Parliament is called upon to <span class="highlight">vote</span> moneys for these purposes it should at least have some interest in the use to which the money is put; it should have some interest in the utilisation of funds which we are called upon to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Should we be asked to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on these measures without having seen the end result of the decisions and the application of the funds? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I agree with the Opposition statement that the users need treatment, I cannot <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment because, as I have stated, the penalties as 1 read them in the Bill are still not harsh enough for these characters who would undermine the health, both physical and mental, of the youth of our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After this report was tabled, some of my colleagues said to me very kindly that they noted I did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Labor side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That was not pressed to the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The verdict of not guilty was carried by one <span class="highlight">vote</span> and, with a larger attendance, the verdict of guilty was later carried by one <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the House knows from the report of the Committee, later still, with a full attendance of members for the first time, the verdict of guilty which had substituted the verdict of not guilty was recommitted, again by a majority of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> and was finally upheld by the casting <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the  Chairman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, I understand, is a matter on which there is to be a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and as a member of the Privileges Committee he is entitled to express his own views in his own way and to <span class="highlight">vote</span> accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to the unusual aspects of this case and to the fact that the ultimate finding was made only on the casting <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the  Chairman  - that is myself - 1 feel personally that the motion moved tonight by the Leader of the House is reasonable and, in all the circumstances, would best serve the dignity of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As this is to be a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> I intend to support the motion that has been moved by the Leader of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As indicated in the report I moved accordingly and my motion was carried by one <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Referring to the one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one way or the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The votes taken during the proceedings indicate this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was quite surprised that the  Chairman  of ‘the Privileges Committee, the honourable member for Ryan  (Mr Drury),  whose casting <span class="highlight">vote</span> was the one that was responsible for bringing down the findings and recommendations as set out in the Committee’s report, has indicated that he intends to do nothing about the recommendations for which he voted and intends to vole in support of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this matter will be a free one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that I am very surprised indeed that the  Chairman  of the Privileges Committee whose casting <span class="highlight">vote</span> was responsible for the findings and recommendations that are before the House now has altered his mind, will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the recommendations of the Committee but intends to suport the motion moved by the Leader of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I give all due respect to my honourable friend who had the courage to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Committee on a matter he saw affecting the dignity of his Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I give credit to those who may have voted against the findings of the Committee because they did not agree with the methods adopted by the Privileges Committee which I mentioned earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the honourable member for Ryan  (Mr Drury),  who T understand exercised a casting <span class="highlight">vote</span>, I say good luck for his courage on this important issue because it is a difficult position to be put in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the honourable member for Eden-Monaro  (Mr Allan Fraser)  all the way when he suggests that it is unjust to say that because he worked for the ‘Daily Telegraph’ he came down with a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of not guilty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the House to how the honourable member voted on 12th October in the case of the letter that had been printed in the ‘Australian’ claiming that to get anything done one had to give members of Parliament $10,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that case Messrs Brown, Donald Cameron, Crean, Jarman, Turnbull and Whitlam all voted together, whilst  Mr Allan  Fraser voted the other way despite the fact that the editor of the newspaper concerned had agreed that what was involved was a contempt of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee cannot operate unless it has a quorum, lt had a quorum and it took a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Party always allows a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on matters arising from committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House has before it 2 motions upon which it can <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the recommittal every <span class="highlight">vote</span> which I made in that Committee led to the same conclusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I am asking the members of this House to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the motion moved by the Leader of the House  (Mr Swartz). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will be very interested at the conclusion of this debate to see whether a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But’ if a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is allowed,-‘ and I hope it will be, I will’ be interested to ‘see whether members of this Parliament are prepared to support the appointment of a parliamentary committee to inquire into the future of human beings in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The time for the debate ran out; I was given the right to continue my remarks; the matter remained on the notice paper; the debate was never concluded; and no <span class="highlight">vote</span> had been taken when the Parliament was dissolved for the 1961 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Beaton’s motion in 1965 never came to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At 12.30 p.m., which was the cut-off time for General Business at that time, our Whip moved that the time for the discussion be extended to 12.45 p.m. Government supporters voted against this extension of time, although  Mr Anthonywas  on his feet at the time when the debate was interrupted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The list of Government members who voted against the extension of time for  Mr Anthony  was headed by  Mr Anthony  himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have nothing to contribute except a request that their dwindling farm <span class="highlight">vote</span> be made even more secure against population changes in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker,  you, perhaps better than anyone, would know that nothing counts much but votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person can advocate anything he likes but it is the <span class="highlight">vote</span> that determines a matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member agrees with that because it is the <span class="highlight">vote</span> that counts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the <span class="highlight">vote</span> that first of all puts a man into Parliament and afterwards, when he gets into Parliament, he soon finds out that the <span class="highlight">vote</span> determines whether he will get something implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The views of the Opposition are exactly as they were before and they will stay that way until the Government presents evidence in this Parliament, allows it to be debated and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> taken both in this House and in the Senate to support the relaxation of the ban. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last time that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken in the Parliament was in the Senate and the Senate rejected the Government’s recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Government was not bound by the decision of the Senate, its action being taken by regulation and not by an Act of Parliament or an amendment to an Act, the Government contemptuously ignored the decision of the Senate and despite repeated efforts by the Opposition the Government refused to have the matter debated and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A referendum was held but unfortunately, because of tremendous confusion throughout the industry, caused by intensive lobbying and misunderstanding, the wool growers voted against the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However the ALP is still opposed to any relaxation of the embargo on the export of merino rams until, I repeat, there is a debate in this Parliament and until a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that debate the Government should put forward its evidence, scientific, economic and otherwise, to enable all members of this House to debate it, to weigh it up and to <span class="highlight">vote</span> upon it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as the Government well knows we cannot bring the matter to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> unless the Government wants a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know from experience that we have never been able to get a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on matters of this kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a question of having the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another point I want to make is that we do not know what the last <span class="highlight">vote</span> taken by the Australian Wool Industry Conference was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that I could find out what the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was if I wanted to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, at the moment I do not know what the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But certainly the first <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the AWIC decision was by no means unanimous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that the Minister for Primary Industry, who is at the table, gave no indication of what the composition of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the AWIC was at this time.I can only assume that the result was the same as last time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I say that the Minister should allow the Parliament to debate it I mean that this matter should be put to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this House and in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the contrary, on most occasions the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the wool growers at these meetings against the relaxation of the ban has been overwhelming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said this against a background that the Australian Senate - the other half of this sovereign Parliament of the nation - had voted against the lifting of the ban on the export of merino rams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This half of the Parliament has nol yet had an opportunity to debate it or to <span class="highlight">vote</span> upon it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the matter were resolved by a majority <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the House of Representatives - gathered, I would hope, as a democratic body, free of petty Party allegiances on such an important matter - to lift the ban, it would be incumbent on all of us to see to it that  hz  ban was lifted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if they do not want to reach a substantive decision, if they want to hide for reasons best known to themselves, they will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not yet been permitted to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand your tolerance,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  on the eve of the Christmas break, but it is very nice to hear my friend the honourable member for Angas ask which way I would <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government’s policy - is: Let us have this opportunity for debate and for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be taken, because the Government has an undertaking from the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  that if all members of the Parliament, democratically assembled without regard to party, favour or pressure, come to a decision on this question concerning the export of merino rams, then a i of us on all sides of the Parliament will  bc  duty bound to see that the flow of merino exports is continued, if that is desired, or that it is halted, if that is desired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that if you were not in the Chair you would <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a democratic expression of opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the motion to suspend Standing Orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whichever way the <span class="highlight">vote</span> goes I will pledge myself to implement the democratic decision of the House of Representatives on this controversial matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the circumstances, I think that it would be desirable for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be taken on the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As has been requested by the 2 members of the Opposition who have spoken to this motion, we should then proceed to take the <span class="highlight">vote</span> that they have sought on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The circumstances are completely changed The Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  has suggested that there ought to be a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the position with regard to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on an important issue such as this? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the House has now StIffgested that there ought to be a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is to be a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this important issue, quite clearly the substance of the argument advanced by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, very capably supported by the honourable member for Riverina who did not transgress the Standing Orders in the debate but who put his case very clearly that there should b; a suspension of Standing Orders which would enable this matter to be debated fully, leads to the question: What has the Government to hide? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the House has acquiesced to the extent that he is now prepared to allow the House to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But surely it is not a proper procedure to allow the House to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on a most important matter before that matter has been considered fully by honourable members who. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances, if the Leader of the House is prepared to allow a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, I suggest that he might be prepared to allow a debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then this Parliament will be in a position to record a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and to make a decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought the honourable member for Dawson might well have talked about the issues instead of talking about the fact that he was being denied the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point at issue at the moment is whether or not we should suspend Standing Orders in order to allow for those matters which the honourable member for Dawson suggested were necessary, a debate and a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Riverina in seconding the motion moved by the honourable member for EdenMonaro that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> should be taken in the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Opposition wants a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the suspension of Standing Orders and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the motion that the House take note of the paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather, we should get rid of this motion and then take a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the original motion that the House take note of the paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will put it to the <span class="highlight">vote</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the <span class="highlight">vote</span> had been counted, Ben Chifley said: ‘Six ayes and one no - the noes have it’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the reason for the Government’s decision to wthhold the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> from persons 18 to 20 years old when they have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Stale elections in certain States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-59-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right nf persons under the age of 21 years to vole at Western Australian State elections does nol give such persons he right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at Federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-59-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am seeking to show - and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on my motion to suspend Standing Orders is the only way to do it - that the Government acted wrongly when it sat idly by and allowed BHP to increase the price of steel by 5.3 per cent at a time when the Government was proposing to reintroduce the investment allowance, the value of which would have been enough to reduce by at least 1 per cent, or one-fifth, the increase of 5.3 per cent, even if that increase of 5.3 per cent could have been justified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It affects the living standards, the savings and the welfare of Australians everywhere and the fact that the Government will not allow a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue is something about which the people should be enlightened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government seeks to evade the public gaze by avoiding a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on why it is applying double standards to society in Australia and why wage earners who comprise 90 per cent of the people have to prove their case in the courts against Government opposition when investors, represented by BHP and Government supporters, get unlimited patronage from honourable members opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Country Party also seek to evade a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it because they know that their leader has publicly supported the increase in the price of steel although it will mean that the cost of every fowl house and pig sty will go up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that every form of equipment used in the country will increase in price and honourable members in the Country Party know that they cannot afford to <span class="highlight">vote</span> with their leader on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No wonder the newly knighted honourable member for Mallee  (Sir Winton Turnbull)  does not want a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue to show that he supports the steel price increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are seeking to show by moving for the suspension of Standing Orders is that every member on the Government side is afraid to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the issue because he knows the public will condemn his actions and he will go to his political doom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should we not <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this steel price issue? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government seeks to evade a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the suspension of Standing Orders because it does not want the public to know how it is protecting its great and wealthy interests in the community irrespective of the effect on the living standards of Australians everywhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far be it for me to endeavour to evade a ruling of the Chair, as you well know,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  but I was giving under headings the reasons why Standing Orders should be suspended in order that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the motion under discussion can be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why we should have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on a measure like this is plain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the Australian people are entitled to know the views of those on this side, whether or not votes are taken, who represent about SO per cent of the people, or are we to be cast aside when the issues are to be presented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would not under any circumstances move for the suspension of Standing Orders if the Government would have a fair <span class="highlight">vote</span> on these questions but when it dodges its responsibilities, refuses to answer the’ charges and flippantly and arrogantly treats the Opposition with contempt, why should we not move for the suspension of Standing Orders to discuss this issue? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can take it from me,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  that if I were on the Government side I would not want to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I were a member on the Government side I would not want a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on that either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think that some honourable member on the Government side should tell the Opposition why they will not allow the suspension of Standing Orders so that we can have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Governments are put in and out of office on votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will become a no-<span class="highlight">vote</span> Parliament if this motion is not carried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government could not prevent the increase in steel prices and did everything possible, what is wrong with a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on an issue like this? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only reason why a <span class="highlight">vote</span> will not be taken and why the Government will not support the measure is that honourable members opposite have guilty consciences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the attitude taken by the Government, let me tell the Australian people that it is ashamed of its policy and will not allow a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be taken on it in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is ashamed to let this be taken to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian people should realise that there is patronage unlimited for BHP; there is suppression for the workers of this country; there is unlimited unemployment under the policy being sponsored by this Government which refuses, on a great national issue affecting every wage earner in the community and every person in the country districts, to allow a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government sits silently by, refuses to defend its policy and refuses to allow a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be taken on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can he say whether 18-year-olds living in South Australia are considered legally to be adults and qualified to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at State elections as from 30th June 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-32-21">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite certain, and I am sure the Government and the Postmaster-General  (Sir Alan Hulme)  are aware, that if there were a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in both Houses of the Parliament on this matter and the Parliament expressed its view it would be angry at the closing of these small post offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be no <span class="highlight">vote</span> taken on this question; i is just a discussion on a matter of public importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition will now test the Government, and particularly the Country Party, on whether it is prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But when it comes to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, the people of Australia in rural electorates will see how these people really <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, because the Opposition has facilitated the discussion of this matter this evening, an opportunity will be sought to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will give him the opportunity this evening to cross the floor to facilitate a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The right honourable member for Fisher has been itching to cross to this side of the House to give his support for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the honourable member for Dawson in his move to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> taken on this important issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I support the motion to suspend Standing Orders to enable a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be taken on this important matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were treated in various parts of the world as favoured people until the moment when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> came in the United Nations and from then we were peremptorily dismissed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 know that Government supporters have been told to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against ihe establishment of more such committees, for instance the committee which we have proposed should be established to inquire into the overseas control of our natural resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And incorporating those words in an amendment which was passed means it’s a very dangerous thing, because if this is followed by the Caucus as it should be it means we will have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the wheat stabilisation Bill, dairy, industry, the various wool commitments, the Australian Wool Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 have no doubt that when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken on this new piece of legislation the Government will reject the amendment moved by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have made clear to the House, immediately after the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken in the United Nations we were informed - not directly from the representatives of the People’s Republic but indirectly - that the time was inopportune for a visit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720301_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is time that a firm decision was made and ensuing legislation brought down for the provision of equal free time for local government candidates, State parliamentary candidates, Federal parliamentary candidates or, for that matter, any person standing for an elected position of important community function where most of the community population has the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> or will be affected by an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720301_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In anticipation that the Government would win on a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to extend the renewal period to a maximum of 3 years the Opposition decided that if licences are to be renewed for 3 years then it should be up to the Minister to ensure that the television and broadcasting stations are doing the right thing by the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people outside, the workers whom they claim to represent, the people who <span class="highlight">vote</span> for us year in and year out, are the ones who supply the money to open the university so that the young people of today can have a better opportunity for education and then plough back into our society some of the knowledge they have gained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Only a week or 10 days ago the Brisbane ‘Courier Mail I might say that it carries more information than the ‘Sunraysia Daily’ carries and one can rely on it much more - carried a story titled ‘ALP <span class="highlight">vote</span> sack him.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I was saying in this very serious contribution, 2 weekends ago there was an overwhelming <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Victoria that the honourable member for Fremantle was unsuitable for his job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder why honourable members in this House are prepared to hide behind the genuine appearance which the honourable member for Fremantle presents and the votes he undoubtedly wins because of his sincerity, knowing that when the Victorian group moves it spells death for anybody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Translated that means: ‘We know what needs to be done, we know you want us to do something but we have been able to get away with it because you have never threatened to <span class="highlight">vote</span> us out of office’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most producer nominees are either selected by executive committees or by a majority <span class="highlight">vote</span> at annual conferences of State associations which in practice are attended by a relatively few association members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently the persons who finally <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the nominations may represent only a small proportion of the producers registered in their respective States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A producer will be entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a poll and to be a candidate for election if he is the owner of 200 hives of bees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposal is not acceptable as it is considered that as provision is being made for the election of producer members it should be left to the producers to decide by a majority <span class="highlight">vote</span> whether a beekeeper with packer interests should be elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At no time since the Board’s establishment has it been possible for packer members to outvote the producer members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, honey packers have previously stated that they would not be effective as representatives with a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on behalf of packers in another State whose crop and stock position and methods of business were unknown to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, as to the other point that is raised - that is, about the 18-year-olds - I think I can assure him that the law will not be changed in time to give 18-year-olds a <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the next election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people think it is not they should <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they think it is a good work to do they should <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the money to cover it and the Government, of course, has already decided on that amount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition, with a 222,000 <span class="highlight">vote</span> surplus, certainly won a majority of votes over the combined Liberal-Country Party <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not votes that gave them their mandate, and the Prime Minister was careful not to say that it was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister take the opportunity to update the antiquated method of voting  -  I understand that they have not had a real <span class="highlight">vote</span> since 1934  -  and also to increase the number of members representing the Australian dairy farmers to provide for 2 members from Victoria in keeping with Victoria’s major part in producing dairy produce for export? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having looked at statements made by the Labor Party over many years, I would have grave doubts, if it were not for the fact that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> was attached to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is fair to suggest that the Government is again trying to capture the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Democratic Labor Party that it needs so desperately to be re-elected to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government has decided against adopting the Bill I ask whether it has decided to allow a debate and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Bill or will he, as he did 4 years ago, move for the adjournment of the debate on the Bill which would then again remain on the notice paper until the House is dissolved for the elections? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker,  you will remember that at question time I asked the Foreign Minister  (Mr N. H. Bowen),  who represents the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  in this House, whether the Government would be adopting this Bill or, alternatively, whether it would, without adopting the Bill, allow a debate and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, if no <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken, this legislation which most of us want will be aborted for the lifetime of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would surely, therefore, be a travesty if this House were not at least to consider the Bill, to debate it and to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many social issues, as they are often regarded or described, where there can be strong differences of opinion in political parties and where the path to reform - reform may be either by way of relaxing or tightening the laws - lies in a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Party has not supported the idea of a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the death penalty because the death penalty is a decision which depends on governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was aiming to do that by drawing a distinction between some matters which are regarded or described as conscience issues and where it is proper and practical for members of a political party to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in different ways, and on the other hand a case like this where the decision is made by a government as to whether the death penalty is to be imposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the honourable gentlemen who have interjected are restive at the fact that there is not at this stage a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> allowed by their colleagues in this House as a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> has been allowed them in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is not too sharp a word to say that it is spurious for members of the Liberal Party to say that they need to consider this matter before they can <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the House of Representatives when they have twice - earlier this month and 4 years before - been free to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this matter in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we to believe that the Liberal Party is free to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this matter in the Senate but not free to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it in the House of Representatives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we to believe that the Liberal Party made up its mind that its members were free to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this matter in the Senate but requires time to make up its mind on whether its members are free to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the House of Representatives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do, however, propose to give some of the arguments why a <span class="highlight">vote</span> should be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have done their best to get the same freedom of <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this House as has been accorded to their colleagues in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The net result might be the same because there would be no <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, since June 1970 there has been no resumption of debate and no <span class="highlight">vote</span> on my Adulthood Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since August 1970 there has been no resumption of debate and no <span class="highlight">vote</span> on my Territory Senators Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has had 7 years to consider this matter since there was last a <span class="highlight">vote</span> upon it in the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate has again, as it did 4 years ago, voted in favour of abolishing the death penalty insofar as this Parliament can achieve that objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Senate, members of the Liberal Party and the other Parties were given a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> and some of them voted with members of the Labor Party to pass this Bill, as they did 4 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a travesty of the parliamentary process if, for a second time, as 4 years ago, the will of the Senate were not even to come up for debate and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances I believe that we should <span class="highlight">vote</span> against adjourning this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  at great length went into the question of the need for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I judged from the interjections - friendly in a sense - of some of the supporters on the Government side when the Leader of the Opposition was speaking that they were concerned about the situation that the Labor Party would <span class="highlight">vote</span> as a Party and that members of the Government Parties might not <span class="highlight">vote</span> as a Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they want to <span class="highlight">vote</span> that way, what is wrong with it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they do not want to treat it that way, do not treat it as a Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> but as a matter of conscience because that may well be what it should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having spoken on the question of why this matter should go to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and tried to get rid of this red herring about one side of the House not having it as a Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> and the other side having it as a Party <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and having tried to illustrate the irrelevance of that argument, let me now make a few points on the question of capital punishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the  Clerk  has now pointed out to me - and it is something I had overlooked - that leave was granted to the Leader of the House to continue the debate, and in those circumstances the Leader of the Opposition may <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the motion for the adjournment of the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, inexplicably, when we attempted to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the subject they all voted against the motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then  we  tried again and the honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson)  moved for the suspension of Standing Orders on that same day to enable the motion to be debated until the question was put and the Parliament had an opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the second time that day Government members voted against the motion from their own side on this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that he said he would not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for his own motion or for an Opposition motion if it was tied in any way to replacing the wine excise with a sales tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest to those Catholics in our community who consider their Catholicism to be the most important part of their makeup and who probably, in a significant proportion of cases, <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Australian Democratic Labor Party in States such as Victoria, that they talk to some of the Liberal members of Parliament, to the Liberal Ministers, to the Malcolm Frasers, the Robert Menzies, the Malcolm Mackays, the David Fairbairns, the Geoff Gilleses, the Tony Staleys and the Jim Forbeses about parochial schools, or Ireland, or the monarchy, or a truly independent Australia with a new flag and a new anthem and see how much they have in common with those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor caucus could be relaxed so that those Opposition members who are genuinely interested in the improvement of educational standards - and there are quite a number - could cross the floor and <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Government against this very ill-conceived amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We accept that argument and we will be interested to watch how the Minister will <span class="highlight">vote</span> on our amendment providing for the representation of the community generally and specialised educational research bodies in the advisory council, not a governing council, to assist what we hope will be  3  commissioners responsible to the Minister, not one commissioner responsible to the Public Service Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Party will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will, however, be carried and then, of course, we will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the amendment for the simple reason that it is too clever by half. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be dealt with on its merits and I hope that honourable members <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the original proposition accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave - Having heard what has been said by members of the Opposition I believe it is prop:r, to prevent any misrepresentation or misunderstanding, that we should immediately move to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the original motion moved on behalf of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Government is endeavouring to convey to the Opposition is precisely and simply this: This Bill which the Opposition puts before us today and asks us to <span class="highlight">vote</span> upon and pass today does not spell out the details of the scheme in anywhere near the degree of detail that is necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was here during the evening when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On checking the pairs later I found that although we had promised a pair, no pair was available because the honourable member who had been paired with the honourable member for Gellibrand had inadvertently voted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it when the time comes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicate, as I did previously, that the Opposition will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These procedures, devised to give security to and prevent political victimisation of public servants, have now been disregarded by the introduction of a stand-down clause whereby public servants with a contract of employment for a term of years can be stood down, without pay - the Minister used the expression ‘no work no pay’ and I suppose that is a bit of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> winner - for a cause which may be beyond their control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the honourable membar for Burke made a classic statement when he said that the phrase ‘no work no pay’ was a <span class="highlight">vote</span>-winner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation is intended to remedy that kind of disastrous situation, lt is sound and positive legislation, yet we find members of the Opposition in this debate trying to tell the Parliament that there is no justification for the legislation and that they will oppose it by their <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What amazes me in relation to the debate is that the Australian Labor Party apparently intends to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It amazes me that although the ALP claims to endorse the principles of conciliation and arbitration on this occasion it intends to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against a Bill which, in fact, deals with that section of industry and endeavours to settle disputes in a sound way through an arbitrator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apparently it is a process which is accepted by the ALP although it intends to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this House the Opposition did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A short debate took place, but a <span class="highlight">vote</span> was not taken on the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This decision was carried by a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of 37 to 16. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first year of the partial relaxation of the export embargo was reviewed by the Wool Industry Conference on 16th and 17th March 1971 and by a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of 31 to 17 the Conference recommended the continuation of the relaxation for another year on the same terms and conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 25th and 26th November 1971 the Wool Industry Conference reviewed the second year of the partial relaxation and by a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of 31 to 18 recommended that partial relaxation be continued for a further 3 years until 31st January 1975, on the same terms and conditions as had applied previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead the matter was debated by this House and no dissenting <span class="highlight">vote</span> was recorded when the House took note of my statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Following this debate and a second <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the matter, I intend to ask the exporters to again endeavour to export through normal commercial channels, the rams purchased for export and still awaiting delivery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>SO per cent of the wool grown in New South Wales and a substantial percentage of the Australian clip was grown in the western division of the State,  Mr Blacker  said that the relaxation of the embargo by regulation in defiance of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Senate for its retention pending a plebiscite of growers was viewed by many, in the wool industry as an ‘appalling’ action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party will not agree to a relaxation of this 42-year ban until a <span class="highlight">vote</span> has been given to wool growers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are fully entitled to it and they are eligible so let us not have the type of argument that we cannot get a sufficiently representative poll or that we would not know which wool growers should <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister think that the AWIC, by a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of 37 to 16, speaks for the entire wool industry of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House divided on the proposal and by a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of 52 to 44 - a majority of 8 votes - members of the Opposition were denied a proper opportunity to debate the matter at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although it has been said before, it should be repeated - I do so again - that this ban was imposed without a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He should say that he feels that the growers are not entitled to determine a matter of this kind by exercising a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this important national question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Opposition in this House <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the State Grants (Independent Schools) Bill last week? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister in his reply did indicate that the Opposition in this House did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against that Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amended Act lays down that in regard to the poll eligibility to <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be restricted to those producers having 200 or more hives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is the best figure which has been arrived at for eligibility to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a poll to elect representatives of bona fide beekeepers - those receiving the majority of their income from honey - this is the figure that should be adopted by us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If 2 partners own 200 hives and they are equally active in the business, which one gets the <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of them must get the <span class="highlight">vote</span>, but which one? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do they toss a coin, is one selected or do they have some type of <span class="highlight">vote</span> between themselves? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If 2 partners own 400 hives, obviously each one gets a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, but when 2 partners own 200 hives, which one votes if an argument arises? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this mean that a person, say, 10 years of age is entitled to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> when he is a legitimate partner in a family partnership? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These matters are not important enough to warrant my proposing amendment, but I remind honourable members that there are not many votes in the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With similar Commonwealth and State legislation there has been no experience of deliberate, attempts to manipulate ballots by the creation of new partnerships in order to gain extra votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assume that they are well aware, or will be made well aware, of the provisions of these amendments and the eligibility clauses with respect to ballots, both as to the candidate himself and as to those eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are at least 60 members who reckon they will be able to <span class="highlight">vote</span> when the Act is altered to provide that to be entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> a producer must have a minimum of 200 hives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The estimate I have received is that about 700 members all over Australia will be eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span> under this revised legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the Government is in this awkward predicament and because I feel that there will be some benefit in getting the industry together again so that its members can work more harmoniously, I make this suggestion: When the Australian Honey Board is reconstituted, if that is the right word, under this new legislation, if only 700 members will be eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span> as defined under the Act surely it will not be beyond the wit of the Honey Board to circularise those people and ask: ‘Do you want an Australian Honey Board?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no good saying to them that they ought to be able to get to Adelaide to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has recognised this problem and suggested that the people who have a financial interest in this matter ought to be given a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that 129 or 130 members will be able to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in South Australia under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apiarists Association tells me that it will have about 60 members eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the 200 limit is what is required to qualify for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and for registration and recognition as a bee keeper I thought the figure might be a little high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  chairman  has the casting <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the board is constituted in that way it means that the primary producers, the apiarists, are outvoted and outnumbered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that surely there is some importance about the date on which these people with 200 hives or more become eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is not some safeguard it could be that someone with 800 hives could register, dividing them by 4, and thereby get 4 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, he could divide his holding by 4 into 200 hives each and thereby be entitled to 4 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past most producer nominees were selected by a State executive committee to be on the Honey Board as a producer representative, but in some States they were elected by the majority <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the annual conference of the State association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that in due course the apiarists of Australia will decide, as the honourable member for Wakefield said, to pressure the Board to allow a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be taken on the existence of that body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of this Bill will strengthen the Board and give apiarists the chance to elect their own members to the Board by democratic ballot among those who qualify to <span class="highlight">vote</span> - that is those who have more than 200 hives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interesting point about introducing this provision that apiarists must have 200 hives or more before they qualify to <span class="highlight">vote</span> means that 696 apiarists will be eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are the growers who are excluded from a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scope of the voting stretches right across the Commonwealth, and in that sense geographically this is a perfectly justified and justifiable method of ascertaining those who are to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, namely, those who have 200 or more hives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is not the definition stated in the legislation on which we are called upon to <span class="highlight">vote</span> this evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From memory, he said that about 696 producers are eligible for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> out of approximately 3,500 producers of honey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The salient point in the Bill is that a producer will be entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a poll and to be a candidate for election if he is the owner of 200 hives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He referred specifically to the question of eligibility for voting, and how old a voter would be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be the intention that those regulations would cover such problems as the age of the voter, the number of persons who would represent partnerships, companies, corporate ownership and so on, but essentially, as 1 understand the position, each owner of more than 200 hives will be given a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If there is more than one person in a partnership, I understand the usual provision is for each partner to be entitled to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I can understand his not wanting parity of electorates because he was elected on a minority <span class="highlight">vote</span> of about 45 per cent of the electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was interested in his one-<span class="highlight">vote</span> one-value theory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regret the necessity for the legislation but we indicate to the people that this is more than ever a reason why they should <span class="highlight">vote</span> for Labor candidates in the forthcoming election and destroy those who, under the guise of representing the country people, misrepresent them in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage I indicate that I intend to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against each of these recommendations for one reason if no other, and that is that the Government has not given this Parliament any information regarding the activities, expenses or functions of Assistant Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are ghostlike figures, seldom seen, except when the Prime Minister wants their <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Party room and then up go the hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>part I am opposed to this motion and intend to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against those recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, on this occasion, and with no commitment one way or the other to the present system of Assistant Ministers, I do not propose to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the recommendations of the Standing Orders Committee unless I am convinced that I should do so by some further debate here this evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be many more free votes on internal questions within Bills because there are a remarkable number of non-partisan matters which pass through this place about which the Ministry should not be so possessive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just give honourable members the warning that they will have to make up their own minds about that and remind them that we have a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on matters relating to Standing Orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it should be recognised by the House that one of the unfortunate features of this debate is that when a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken honourable members on the Opposition side will have a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> whereas the Whips on the Government side will gather together all honourable members on their side who have not been present to listen to the debate, to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on party lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Assistant Minister accepts or rejects an amendment, will the people sitting behind him <span class="highlight">vote</span> against him? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not all having free votes from now on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommendations now before the House in this report conform to the authority that was given to the Parliament by <span class="highlight">vote</span> of this House; that is, a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the House approved the appointment of Assistant Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all right for the Government to say that we agreed to the provision of Assistant Ministers by a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the House but, as everybody knows, a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the House simply means an unconditioned <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>; it was a Party <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A free <span class="highlight">vote</span> might decide that Assistant Ministers were necessary or that they were extraneous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These motions have never been put to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>; nor have they been extended to the other 2 i countries, namely, Laos and Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I recall the decision that was taken a couple of years back, this was to be a subject for free <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view it is not good enough, as happened the other night, when as far as I can tell from the division list, every honourable member opposite voted the party line but those on this side of the House at least broke across the party line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was decided a couple of years ago that questions associated with the Standing Orders would be the subject of a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only hope that honourable members will throw off the fetters of party discipline and <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not talking about whether this is a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the recommendation that has been put before this House for us to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on does not mean a thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a few minutes, when this debate is concluded, there will be an extraordinary tangle when we try to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the various proposals which have been raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A free <span class="highlight">vote</span> is to be held on this subject and in view of the fact that hon ourable members have been extended what might be described as this privilege I believe that we have the right to speak our minds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is to be a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> and I have no intention of supporting the suggested amendment on the question of petitions because I believe it is not in the best interests of the Parliament or the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Might I ask Government supporters to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the amendment in a non-party way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I echo today my regret, more in sorrow than in anger, that non-party votes in this Parliament inevitably find every Liberal voting on the party line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be an historic day - even on a <span class="highlight">vote</span> concerning Standing Orders - when one Liberal sees fit to support commendable amendments in respect of things that are important to all democracies, particularly to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should the honourable member for North Sydney for instance not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in accordance with our policy naturally we proceeded with the legislation, but tonight I ask Government supporters to see whether they cannot <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Opposition on some of the proposals in these amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a waste of time having non-party votes if supporters of the Liberal Party, despite their independence that we are told about are to be regimented, even on simple things like the Standing Orders of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here is a chance in an election year for the honourable member for North Sydney to be a real statesman, to <span class="highlight">vote</span> without fear of expulsion and to cross the floor and <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the important things and the really emotional issues of the Standing Orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Might our new silent knight from Mallee  (Sir Winton Turnbull)  see fit on one occasion to cast a very intelligent <span class="highlight">vote</span> for something put up by the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A completely free <span class="highlight">vote</span> has been permitted by the Opposition on all these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want to make the Parliament more effective and if the backbench members of the Parliament who sit on your right,  Mr Speaker,  or on your left, want to play a more purposeful role, let them <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of this proposal put forward by the honourable member for Riverina so that petitions will be considered not only by the responsible Ministers but also by a committee appointed by this Parliament through the respective parties to ensure that action is taken upon matters about which the people have submitted their views and pleas to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not referring to a non-party <span class="highlight">vote</span>; I am referring to a normal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is very difficult, by having a non-party <span class="highlight">vote</span>, to bring about something which will continue to be supported along non-party lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, in all the years that I have been a member of Parliament, no Opposition members and  very  few Government supporters have voted with the party to which they do not belong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all right to say that there will be a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>, but as soon as the free <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken, what we decide by that <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be put into operation by a party <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People <span class="highlight">vote</span> candidates into office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to make some comments on the remarks made by the honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Grassby),  in which he accused Government members of being disciplined into voting in a particular way when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken the other night and there was some crossing of the line, if you like to put it that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, as  Deputy Chairman  I drew attention to the fact that there was a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, when they did <span class="highlight">vote</span> they were supporting the report of the Standing Orders Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken none other than the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  voted with members who are condemned by the honourable member for Riverina. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant),  another member of that Committee, voted the same way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the other members of the Committee voted in that way also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder why the very great preponderance of members of the Labor Party voted against the report of this Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did they <span class="highlight">vote</span> in such predominant numbers against the report of this Committee if they were not being political about it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to refute completely that I was in any way disciplined or requested to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in any way other than what I felt was the right way to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be remarkable, but I would like to see Liberal and Country Party members <span class="highlight">vote</span> on non-party lines on issues that concern democracy in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is, though, that it is more than remarkable that rarely if ever does a member of the Government parties cross the floor to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for anything moved by a member on this side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  has on occasions voted differently from his Party, but I think we have still to get one recruit from the Government side for a motion moved by us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all is said and done, when the votes are being taken we might just as well make the matter a party issue because there is no hope at all of getting any support from the Government side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He mentioned, not as anything to do with the Standing Orders, that he would <span class="highlight">vote</span> this way to safeguard the nation against a Labor administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, tonight I hope to see him with us, and that will be the first break in the ranks of the Governmet in a non-party <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I voted according to what I thought was right and 1 wasnot influenced by anyone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No-one on our side of the House canvassed votes or lobbied in any manner whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is far from the truth for the honourable member for Riverina to say that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken on party lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I think it is a tragedy that on a matter which calls for a non-party <span class="highlight">vote</span> Government supporters are voting as one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not let the honourable member for Sydney  (Mr Cope)  pretend that this is not a political situation, whether or not there is a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the issue here, merely because some people in the community genuinely believe that they have a case to put and that this might be the best way to put it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is not sufficient, and it may not be, we can <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the recommendation, but for my part  1  believe that the subject has been quite adequately canvassed, and I think one might properly use the word ‘researched’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I might get back to political overtones, he and other members of his party, in a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> situation, conned members into reducing speaking time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will have much pleasure in supporting the amendment when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I am asking honourable members to strike a blow for their own personal freedom, show their common sense and exercise their free <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this instance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask everybody - this is a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> and I am not appealing on party lines - to cross to the same side as the honourable member for Wills in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has spoken so much about there being a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the subject of this debate, but there is no such thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for North Sydney, who just interjected, is the only man on the Government side of the chamber who has had the courage to <span class="highlight">vote</span> with members of the Opposition, as he did last night, on a proposition put forward by a member of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not prepared to break their chains and <span class="highlight">vote</span> against their masters even in an open <span class="highlight">vote</span> debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How are they going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> tonight? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the first chance we have had for decades to introduce some sanity into our hours of sitting yet the majority of honourable members will probably <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one of the few occasions on which honourable members are entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> according to their own way of thinking and their own consciences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of my colleagues propose to <span class="highlight">vote</span> that the standing order should remain as it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not care if there is a unanimous <span class="highlight">vote</span>, except for my <span class="highlight">vote</span>, to defeat the motion to alter the Standing Orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member referred a number of times to the fact that there is to be what he describes as a ‘free <span class="highlight">vote</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst [ understood that we are to have a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue I would like honourable members to accept my word that I was not at the same time aware of the fact that as there was to be a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> there should be no political content in matters raised in the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore feel that it is impossible to break up the responsibility in such a way as to say that the discharge of the individual free <span class="highlight">vote</span> relying upon the conscience of each individual can be carried out so as to ignore the collective responsibility of honourable members on this side of the chamber and honourable members opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I venture to suggest that the functions of Government members will not change and, although honourable members opposite talk about a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>, it must be a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> seen in the context of the political arena. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a number of us do see common sense, as was suggested by some of the previous speakers, and <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of the amendment that the motion to adjourn the House be moved at 10 p.m., then no doubt the Government, being confronted with the problem of finding extra time in which to deal with the business of the House, will give consideration to an earlier start to offset the disadvantage which will accrue as a result of an earlier rising of the Parliament on sitting days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I remind all honourable members, particularly those on this side of the House because I know that honourable members on the other side can speak for themselves, that this is a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Wilmot said that this is the first time for many years that there has been a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time and time again when we are not allowed a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on a subject I know that many members on this side of the House are bubbling and boiling inside, wanting to support the Opposition on a certain matter, but because members of the Opposition play so much party politics, it is very difficult for honourable members on this side of the House to support the Opposition, and we stick together as a team. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this occasion we have been given a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and I think that we will be able to discharge our responsibilities if we start our day earlier and rise at an earlier hour each night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rarely have I known 2 men to exhibit such intelligence as they have on this occasion by indicating that they will <span class="highlight">vote</span> on a non-party matter in a non-party way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister picked out the ones who, firstly, he knew would <span class="highlight">vote</span> for him and, secondly, would take the risk for a bit of prestige on somebody challenging their positions in the courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government is challenging the right of 18-year olds to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why I have moved this amendment on behalf of myself, because it is an amendment <span class="highlight">vote</span>, that when the constitutional position of Assistant Ministers has been determined, then these standing orders will take effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recommendations 1 to 6 contain nothing but references to Assistant Ministers and the House by a majority <span class="highlight">vote</span> of 53 to 35 on 13th April 1972 accepted recommendations 1 to 6, all of which accept the concept of Assistant Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among those who voted with the ayes on that occasion were the honourable members for Wills  (Mr Bryant),  Adelaide  (Mr Hurford),  Capricornia  (Dr Everingham)  and Bendigo  (Mr Kennedy)  and the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Grayndler knows that I would be the last person in this House to indulge in party politicking, but I remind him that his own Leader on 13th April voted for the acceptance of the concept of Assistant Ministers, together with the other distinguished members of his Party I have just named. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask for the indulgence of the House in order to ascertain whether honourable members opposite wish to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the gag as well as the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is not it tragic to think that after 23 years of a policy for the countryman foisted upon the Liberal Party by the Country Party tonight we have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and speak on the grant of $121m to save the rural industries from destruction despite the policies of this administration? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is not this an indication that this year the people in the country districts should <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the only real country party representatives, the members of the Australian Labor Party who really understand the problems of the country people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result has been that the Government has to <span class="highlight">vote</span> $12 lm to allow farmers and others to get unemployment relief and assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point at issue is that the members of the Country Party in this Parliament get 10 per cent of the votes of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But by rigged and gerrymandered boundaries, where one <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the country is worth about 2 in the cities, they dominate the Government of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can the Prime Minister leave Australia when things are as I have just mentioned and when, I understand, the Liberal Club in Canberra is asking the Australian people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> Labor at the next elections? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present, the Act only empowers the Commission to order that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> be taken of the members of an organisation where it considers that this would assist the settlement of a dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In light of the Government’s firm view of the importance of amalgamation to the membership of the organisations concerned, we have provided in the Bill that, before an amalgamation is approved, there must be a clear indication that the widest- possible <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the membership has taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For an amalgamation to succeed, therefore, it will require a <span class="highlight">vote</span> by at least half of the eligible membership of each organisation and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour by more than half of those voting formally in each organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, if the eligible membership of an organisation is 1,000, 500 will be required to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and, assuming that that 500 <span class="highlight">vote</span> formally, 251 or approximately 25 per cent will be required to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the  Chairman  or the Acting  Chairman  presiding at a meeting of the committee or of a sub-committee, have a deliberative <span class="highlight">vote</span> and, in the event of an equality of voting, also have a casting <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a curious coincidence that the very people to whom he chose to make the extravagant claims have since pointed the <span class="highlight">vote</span> rigging finger right at the New South Wales ALP machine for which  Mr Westerway  is responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable members of this House, indeed the Australian people, can make their own assessment of certain people in the New South Wales ALP, about whom serious allegations of <span class="highlight">vote</span> rigging are being made by members of his own Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At page 13482 of the Notice Paper is listed the Adulthood Bill which would give the <span class="highlight">vote</span> to 18-year olds, and the Territory Senators Bill 1970 which was introduced by the Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the heading General Business is another Bill brought down by the Leader of the Opposition to give 18-year-olds the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does not the Minister tell us why the Government will not debate the matter of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> for 18-year-olds? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of postal votes should be dealt with also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Postal votes have been manipulated by unscrupulous party organisers from time to time and the system needs reforming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why not deal with the question of polling, the question of Senate voting and the question of the elimination of the huge total of about 500,000 informal votes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why not deal with the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, and why not deal with the gerrymandering of electoral boundaries instead of doing what the Government is doing at this stage - just playing party politics under the guise of protecting the officers whom it has forgotten for 6 weeks? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that  Mr Westerway  has some knowledge of <span class="highlight">vote</span> rigging. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One candidate,  Mr Frank  Donnelly, has won the last 2 of the 3 ballots by 2 votes and one <span class="highlight">vote</span> respectively from Alderman Peter Morris. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is even more interesting to note that the committee controlling the credentialling of voters for the Shortland pre-selection consisted of  Mr Peter  Westerway, the State Secretary of the Party;  Mr Lindsay  North, the general returning officer of the New South Wales State Branch;  Mr Young,  the Federal Secretary; and  Mr Kelly,  M.L.A. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following allegations of malpractices and <span class="highlight">vote</span> rigging, it appears that  Mr Donnelly  has lost his pre-selection through the incredible step of the Federal Executive of the Labor Party seizing control after an appeal by  Mr Morris. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this leads me to say that  Mr Westerway  may well be the most experienced conductor of ballots for the ALP and have personal knowledge of <span class="highlight">vote</span> rigging, branch stacking and other irregularities, but whatever his personal experience might be he does not have the right to reflect on the integrity of the Public Service and align his smutty little experiences with the holding of an Australia-wide election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 propose to ask further questions on this matter to make sure that enough money is being provided because this matter comes within the control of the Minister and is of vital importance if we are to have fair electoral rolls at the next election and give members of the public the opportunity to cast the <span class="highlight">vote</span> which they are entitled to cast under our system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The principle of equity between electorates, and the principle of one man one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value are principles which were dearly bought and which should be preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The total average <span class="highlight">vote</span> received by the Labor Party for these  12  seats at the last election was only  46  per cent and the total anti-Labor <span class="highlight">vote</span> was  54  per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us take a hypothetical case, say, in the electorate of Bendigo where the Australian Labor Party candidate receives  10,000  votes, the Country Party candidate receives  9,000  votes, the Liberal Party candidates receives  9,000  votes, and another candidate receives  2,000  or  3,000  votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that hypothetical case the total Labor Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> would be only  10,000,  and the total of the non-Labor <span class="highlight">vote</span> would be 20,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But under the system by which the Labor Party seeks to create a gerrymander, the Labor Party candidate would win even with a very small minority <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other issue about which honourable members opposite tend to talk about is the question of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This question of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value appears on page 33 of the Labor Party’s Platform, Constitution and Rules’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But according to the Australian Constitution - and I think that the Australian elector should know how deep run the feelings of the Labor Party in this regard - it is impossible to have one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value because no State in the Commonwealth can have fewer than 5 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Labor Party has no intention of changing the system to provide for one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would anybody say that the voting system for the Senate is one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value when New South Wales, with 44 per cent of the Australian population, and Tasmania with 3 per cent of the Australian population, both sent 10 senators to Canberra? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will get one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value or first past the post through the House of Representatives, but you will never get it through the Senate’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is spelt out in the Labor Party platform - first past the post voting, compulsory voting and a redistribution based on a one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value parrot cry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are not many people who would not recollect the Playford Liberal Government in South Australia that was elected to office with only 36 per cent of the popular <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I then took the opportunity of moving the suspension of Standing Orders so that we could put this to a test by voting on this proposition, because as the House knows, as perhaps the public are not aware, we cannot <span class="highlight">vote</span> on issues brought forward as matters of public importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members on the Government side support my motion for the suspension of Standing Orders, it means that we can then put our motion calling for a committee of inquiry before the House, and if they <span class="highlight">vote</span> for that motion it means that an independent committee of inquiry into poverty in Australia will be set up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But no doubt they will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this proposal as they voted against proposals at the beginning of 1971 moved by the Opposition suggesting that no-one should have to live below the poverty level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is little justification in the available evidence for the view that workers are less likely to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for strike action than their leaders; and findings from our workshop relations survey, already cited, confirm this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This paper also pointed out, as though it was necessary to do so, that section 45 of the existing Act already empowers the Commission to order a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of members in a dispute but that this section had been invoked only 3 times since 1928. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Once this is done, there is no justification for nullifying the wishes of those who do <span class="highlight">vote</span> just because a certain percentage of members are too apathetic to <span class="highlight">vote</span> one way or the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before the last elections for the House of Representatives and during the election the then Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Higgins  (Mr Gorton),  promised that at the next election for the House of Representatives men and women citizens of 18, 19 and 20 years of age would have the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole of the public has understood that the Liberal Party was committed at the last House of Representatives election to introducing the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for 18. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government’s Bill has been stalled for all these months - for the last 14 months - because the Government will not have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this subject of votes at 18 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, where the Commonwealth is responsible in Territories and in other common law countries with whom we usually compare ourselves - Britain, America and Canada - votes are now given at 18 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people who are affected by the administrative and legislative provisions in this regard are denied the votes to influence the legislators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The depopulation of the countryside and the alienation of the outer suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne would be reversed if the young people who are leaving or who are alienated were given the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government should accept, with good grace, votes at 18 years in this year’s House of Representatives election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are excellent chances that men and women of those ages will be able to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this year’s House of Representatives election, even if the Government does not allow a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be taken on the Bill I have introduced today, or on the Bill which I introduced in June 1970, or on the Bill which the Government itself introduced in March last year to which we would move an amendment to give votes at 18 years of age, The reason why these people might have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> at this years House of Representatives election is because the Constitution states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No adult person who has or acquires a right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at elections for the more numerous House of the Parliament of a State shall, while the right continues, be prevented by any law of the Commonwealth from voting at elections for either House of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But by the end of the next month men and women of 18, 19 and 20 years of age in South Australia will not only have adult rights in the general sense; they will also have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at elections for the more numerous House of the Parliament of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the heading ‘Western Australia’ the Attorney-General informed me that some adult rights had been given to minors in the age group 18 to 21 years and that they had been given the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the State Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite likely, therefore, that by the end of next month, when those who have adult rights will also gain the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in South Australia for the State Parliament, those who have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at 18 years of age in Western Australia for the State Parliament will also have adult rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In South Australia it would appear clear, and in Western Australia it seems probable, that by the end of next month men and women of 18 will be adults and they will have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for their State Parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The article reads: li might have been the case that the 18-year-olds would have had to wait until the election, and then presented themselves at the polling booths and demanded to be allowed a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and only then started to take legal action if refused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, pursuant to our general national policy of compulsory enrolment of voters and compulsory voting, section 39b brings people qualified to <span class="highlight">vote</span> under section 41 of the Constitution within the reach of both these requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This puts a different complexion on the position of tine 18 to 21 group; if they are qualified to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, under section 41 of the Constitution at Federal elections, it is their legal duty to go ahead and enrol and <span class="highlight">vote</span>, not hist a matter for individuals to do their thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government does not yield on this matter one would hope that 18-, 19- and 20-year-old citizens in South Australia and, if the Western Australian Parliament passes the full adult Act, in that State also will exercise their right and it would appear their legal duty to apply for enrolment to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this year’s election for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In speaking to this Bill and to the second reading speech of the honourable Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  I express the hope that the rest of his speech was more accurate than his suggestion that the former Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Higgins  (Mr Gorton)  had promised the 18-year- olds of this country a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has not at any time taken issue on or implied opposition to the principle of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for 18-year-olds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst the Government has not expressed a view on the basic principle of granting the right to 18-year-olds, it is important to realise that the franchise age provisions of the Act could only be changed in time to give the 18-year-olds the <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the next elections with consequent extreme pressure on the electoral administration at this point of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without such uniformity we might well find that a person who is compelled by law to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in one State is in breach of the law if he tries to enrol when he crosses the border of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will be persons who in the present circumstances will not have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Commonwealth purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to reports, between 1943 and 1970 public opinion polls on the voting age showed that the percentge of electors in favour of giving the <span class="highlight">vote</span> to a person at 18 years rose from 14 per cent to 51 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that poll also about 300 persons aged between 16 years and 20 years were interviewed and of them 51 per cent favoured the <span class="highlight">vote</span> being given at 18 years and 39 per cent favoured 21 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of those public opinion poll figures how can it be said that the majority of 18-year- olds do in fact want the <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Bill were passed it would raise another issue: 18-year-olds would be compelled to enrol and to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly it is by no means a rare attitude among young people, who would be affected by the Opposition’s Bill, to resent being obliged to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition made great play on what other governments and other countries are doing to give persons between 18 years and 20 years of age the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although it is true that a great number of countries have lowered the franchise age to 18 years, very few of them compel the people affected to enrol or to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Bill put forward by the Leader of the Opposition is passed we will be forcing 600,000 or 700,000 young people to enrol and to <span class="highlight">vote</span> - things which clearly are not sought generally except perhaps by a minority or vocal group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have heard it said that a lot of young people resent the concept of having imposed upon them by law an obligation to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that members of Parliament run away with the idea that the world wants to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An interesting fact is that although the Leader of the Opposition has initiated a debate on this issue on 2 previous occasions, there has been no evidence of a strong groundswell of opinion among 18-year-olds for the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although it is true that 18-year-olds are more mature today, and are better educated than ever before, it does not necessarily follow, I reiterate, that they wish to have additional pressures cast upon them by being forced to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at either Federal or State elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No adult person who has or acquires a right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at elections for the more numerous House of the Parliament of a State shall, while the right continues, be prevented by any law of the Commonwealth from voting at elections for either House of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the question of legal entitlement to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at 18 years of age hinges largely on the interpretation of section 41 of the Constitution, and specifically on the interpretation of the word ‘adult’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition has used the argument that if a young man is old enough to fight and die for his country he is old enough to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This has been the policy of the Australian Labor Party for many years, and in the Parliament, as the Leader of the Opposition stated, we have sought to give effect to it, but our moves have been defeated by the Government Parties, who have refused to take the matter to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and, as has been just stated by the Minister, will not do so today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, let me remind him that on 25th August 1968 the Leader of the Opposition introduced the Adulthood Bill providing for the right to marry and <span class="highlight">vote</span> at 18 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A similar Bill introduced later by the Leader of the Opposition was debated on 4th June 1970 and was adjourned without a <span class="highlight">vote</span> being taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In answer to a question by me on 7th September 1971 (he Minister for the Interior advised that no fewer than 37 countries, some certainly with reservations, give the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> to 18 year old citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A glance at the nations provided for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> at 18 years of age gives a striking example of how far behind Australia lags in providing this democratic practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Take, for instance, Andorra where all male heads of families may <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are just a few which one would hardly describe as advanced democratic nations, yet this reform is an established fact in those countries, lt is a tragic fact that Australia, which once proudly led the world by giving equal, democratic <span class="highlight">vote</span> to every man and woman, now drags at the heels of some of the much less advanced nations of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me now present the case in support of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> at 18 years of age for men and women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Interior said that he did not like to compel youths to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, but he did not express any kindly feelings for those who are compelled to fight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not see that some of those youths may resist this much more I would say than they would resist compulsion to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that they have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is not the question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said that 18-year-olds would object to being compelled to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Great Britain, the United States and other nations accept the principle that if a youth is old enough to be conscripted for military service he is old enough to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and have a voice in the election of his Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that every man under 21 years of age who is called up and called upon to fight for this country realises that the Minister does not think they are entitled to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This argument is defeated if we seek to deny a person of 18 years the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the score of immaturity because is there any reason why it should not be withdrawn from those unfortunate people who reach senility, if we accept that argument? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether or not men and women are mature enough to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at 18, the test to be applied is that they are increasingly involved in social, financial, industrial and political affairs and to take a responsible role in society they must have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it to be said that the dear old lady that votes Conservative or Tory or Liberal or Country Party, God help her, is not as destructive to good government as a young person who supports leftism or militancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this test is applied the logical thing to do is to restrict it to those who are reasonably intelligent, to include an IQ test on every ballot paper and prescribe that failure to pass would render the <span class="highlight">vote</span> informal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite apart from the salient facts that I have presented in support of the Bill, it is extremely doubtful whether the Government can legally deny the <span class="highlight">vote</span> at 18 years in view of recent legislation passed by some of the State governments, as the Leader of the Opposition mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section 41 of the Constitution provides that an adult who has the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in elections for the more numerous Houses of Parliament in a State shall be entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at elections for either House of the Commonwealth Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party has decided to challenge the right of the Federal Government to deny to 1 8-year- olds the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at this year’s Federal elections and it will hinge on the definition of ‘adult’ by the High Court, no doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not seek to canvass this matter at this stage, but I consider that had the Commonwealth given 18-year-olds the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> as promised or indicated some time ago this crisis could have been avoided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Undoubtedly the case for votes for those of 18 years of age is supported by world opinion, by advanced nations and on the grounds of democratic rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government fears the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the 18-year- olds at the forthcoming election and for this reason the Government stubbornly rejects the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means that the present Government is prepared to deny a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to about 10 per cent of the voters at the next elections because it believes they could decide the fate of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister is working on the theory that it is better to deny them a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and be certain that the majority will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against him in preference to giving them democratic justice, and a say in the election of their Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To say the least, to anticipate how the 18-year- olds will <span class="highlight">vote</span> is a rather dubious, doubtful and dangerous pastime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the Prime Minister’s reason for denying them a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, there can be no excuse for doing it on the assumption that they will <span class="highlight">vote</span> right, left centre or against him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we to expect that the Government will postpone this reform until the Minister can computerise the voters’ thoughts and know precisely from their sex and age what party they intend to support if the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is given? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government had acted democratically it would long ago have drawn up the uniform legislation with the States that the Minister spoke about covering all the rights that go with adulthood or the age of legal responsibility, such as the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This process would have eliminated the additional costs of preparing separate rolls and at the same time it would have established a democratic right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for all 18-year-olds irrespective of State boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It appears that under the Liberal-Country Party Government it is not justice or democracy that counts at this time but rather the fear of the effect of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of these young people on this worn out, tired and decadent tory administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the House should <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second matter to which I want to draw attention, arising from comments made by the Leader of the Opposition, is his call for a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Leader of the Opposition says: ‘Let us have a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I presume he means would I <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly would <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Stuart whose contributions in these debates seem to be confined to puerile interjections, asks why I did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind him that the issue being voted on in the last division was the attempt by the Opposition to gag the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the substantive issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition said: ‘Let us have a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind him that on another matter only a few weeks ago we on this side of the House were saying ‘Let us have a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the issue of the abolition of capital punishment’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the Opposition would not allow a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on that issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this mean that there are to be free votes on some issues of conscience and principle and not free votes on others? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it does mean that, does it mean also that the Opposition is to decide which are the issues on which there will be a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> and which are issues on which there is not to be a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is a valid argument that there should be a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the lowering of the voting age, and I agree that a substantial case can be made out for that argument, what is the case against a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the issue of capital punishment and its abolition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are under 21 when you do that and yet you do not allow them a <span class="highlight">vote</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said that if people are old enough to go into the armed Services and old enough to go overseas and defend and fight for their country they are old enough to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it would seem to me that if it is a matter of principle and if in coming to a conclusion about that matter of principle we are looking at maturing ages and what has happened to young people over the last 10 or 20 years, one should come to the conclusion that if a person is entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the age of 18 years, as I believe he should be, he should be entitled to stand as a candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the arguments that have been advanced for enabling or justifying a person to enrol as a voter at 18 years are arguments that can just as validly be put in respect of the proposition that an 18- year old should be able to stand as a candidate for election to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the honourable member for Sturt  (Mr Foster)  and other honourable members who have asked me by way of interjection why I did not cast my <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a particular way I would say it is because this is at least one inconsistency in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Opposition should not think that just because an Opposition member introduces a private member’s Bill on a matter of principle that some of us support, we will automatically <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it in the form in which it is introduced into this Parliament because that simply will not happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been full of inconsistencies and it has not been legislation for which we should be obliged to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He suggested that, in view of the fact that in Australia there is compulsory voting, it would in fact be imposing an obligation and a duty on 18-year olds if this legislation were passed when in fact they may not want to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>with respect to the Minister, I do not think that it is an answer to the case that has been put up for 18-year old voting to say that, because voting in Australia is compulsory, if 18- year-olds were given the <span class="highlight">vote</span> it would compel them to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It never ceases to amaze me how this Government has been able to get away with blatant misuse of the powers conferred upon it merely by being elected to govern although it did not have the majority of the votes cast by the electors, lt has never ceased to amaze me that this Government is able to be the voice of this Parliament through the support of some 22 Australian Country Party members who received less than 8 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second proposition is that before an amalgamation should be permitted  50-plus  per cent of the total membership should <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be noted that because a ballot would have to be a postal ballot and voting is not and could not, for a number of practical reasons, be made compulsory, it would be virtually impossible to get anywhere near a 100 per cent <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The SO-plus per cent proposition implies that a substantial majority of those who do not register a <span class="highlight">vote</span> can be said to be opposed to the proposal for amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is more likely that most of those who strongly oppose the proposal will <span class="highlight">vote</span> and that the majority of those who fail to <span class="highlight">vote</span> are not sufficiently moved against the proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Demarcation disputes can be reduced by judicious amalgamations, and the present Bill makes sensible rules for such amalgamations, namely, secret court controlled ballots; circulation of the cases for and against amalgamation; at least half of the eligible members must <span class="highlight">vote</span>; and, at least half of those voting must be in favour of the amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worth reminding the House that when the Statutory Offices Bill, which provided for salary increases for conciliation commissioners, was debated by this House last December, the honourable member for Hindmarsh, who led for the Opposition said that the Opposition supported and would <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus if the eligible membership of an organisation is 1,000, five hundred will be required to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and, assuming that that SOO <span class="highlight">vote</span> formally, 2S1 or approximately 25 per cent will be required to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister knows full well that when voting is not compulsory there is no hope that anywhere near that percentage of the Australian public will <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They fully illustrate the point; a 25 per cent <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span> enrolment would be nearer the rule and not the exception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have no right to be asked to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in one single <span class="highlight">vote</span> on one clause that introduces 19 new sections into the law of this land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have no right to be called upon to endorse 11 pages of new law in one <span class="highlight">vote</span> dealing with matters that range from the separation of conciliation from arbitration to the right of the Commonwealth to intervene in cases before the Full Bench to prevent the certification of an industrial agreement between 2 parties to a dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no right to introduce in the same one clause, to be the subject of the same one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, the provision that gives the Full Bench the sole right even to certify consent awards without dealing with the 4 specified matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has made it clear that it will not give us the time to debate this matter fully or to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against each clause separately because the time taken for a division on each clause would be 7 minutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition, therefore, although it is not satisfied and not completely happy with the proposed new sub-section, will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it or call for a division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing in this particular clause or in any measure that has been passed since I became a member of this Parliament that has not been done because of political expediency or that has not been done to buy a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and buy the electorate, because most of the electorate has been condemned over at least the last 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If they are prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this question now, where was the courage of their convictions on that occasion? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Country Party member will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this increase in salary of more than 30 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Minister is saying in this legislation as a first tenet is that there must be a 50 per cent poll, that is, half of the people must <span class="highlight">vote</span> in an election before it is a valid election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the 50 per cent who <span class="highlight">vote</span>, at least half, which in effect is 25 per cent of the membership, must <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of the proposition if it is to be successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is a 49 per cent poll and 100 per cent of those who <span class="highlight">vote</span> choose to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of the proposition it will be lost because less than 50 per cent of the people who were eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in fact voted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Being a numbers man from way backand the Minister is smiling so I presume he is some sort of a numbers man too - the name of the game will be to persuade people not to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not be to persuade people to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, but to persuade them not to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be a very great campaign to induce people not to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and thereby negate a proposition because the required percentage does not <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Where the Commission thinks that the prevention or settlement of the dispute would or might be encouraged or assisted by ascertaining the views or attitude of the members, or of a section or class of the members, of the organisation or of a branch … the Commission may order that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> be taken . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that he did not get there by any legal electoral <span class="highlight">vote</span> such as is sought by this Government and which the honourable member for Hindmarsh and his Party would repeal if it ever got to power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the Committee to disagree with the inclusion of this provision in the Bill and <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Opposition, the Party which is taking an intelligent approach to this matter, to take this provision out of this Bill altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a sectional viewpoint that does not have the benefit of a majority decision by referendum or <span class="highlight">vote</span> of any sort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I object to and will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against these proposed amendments to the Act because, in my book, they are bad because they are not in the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I, without any sense of offence to members on either side, remind honourable members on both sides that there was an agreement between the leaders of both parties that this Bill would be the subject of a final <span class="highlight">vote</span> tonight by the hour of 12 o’clock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly if this trend is to continue - and I put this on the basis that there has been agreement - the Government will have to consider applying the guillotine because the Government is determined that this matter will be the subject of a final <span class="highlight">vote</span> before the House rises tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1929 a ballot on a strike was conducted under the control of the court and resulted in a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of 5,318 against and 732 for the proposition that those affected be prepared to work under the existing award. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill will harden the attitude to a strike once a <span class="highlight">vote</span> has been carried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposal is based on the belief that workers are likely to be less militant than their leaders and that, given the opportunity of such a ballot, they would often be likely to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against strike action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is little justification in the available evidence for the view that workers are less likely to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for strike action than their leaders; and findings from our workshop relations survey, already cited, confirms this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two instances of ballots held in recent years in this country where the <span class="highlight">vote</span> went against strike action are sometimes quoted in support of the case for compulsory secret ballots. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once a <span class="highlight">vote</span> has been taken and has gone in favour of strike action, the resulting stoppage may delay a settlement by restricting union leaders’ freedom of action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, how is the question on which the <span class="highlight">vote</span> ls to be taken to be framed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is, for instance, about whether to accept the employers’ latest offer, its result can be stultified if the employer subsequently makes a slightly improved offer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is suggested to people that they will benefit or be at a disadvantage depending on whether they <span class="highlight">vote</span> yes or no, Liberal or Labor or for or against whatever the proposition is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the whole point of having an intelligent <span class="highlight">vote</span> is to have a discussion about what the advantages and disadvantages would be of voting for or against a proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems quite ridiculous to me that a penalty of $500 or imprisonment for 6 months should be incurred if a person puts, in connection with one of these ballots, the proposition that if, for example, the workers <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the strike it means they will be at a disadvantage on account of opposing that strike, or vice versa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the rank and file could <span class="highlight">vote</span> out union officials who made decisions with which they were dissatisfied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, in the absence of that undertaking, I indicate that I would speak in opposition to the proposal and I certainly would <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 50 per cent plus proposition implies that a substantial majority of those who do not register a <span class="highlight">vote</span> can be said to be opposed to the proposal for amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is more likely that most of those who strongly oppose the proposal will <span class="highlight">vote</span> and that the majority of those who fail to <span class="highlight">vote</span> are not sufficiently moved against the proposition - they merely acquiesce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proposed section 158n provides that, in order to bring about an amalgamation, at least SO per cent of those on the role of voters must <span class="highlight">vote</span> and more than 50 per cent of those who <span class="highlight">vote</span> must <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of an amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>advance, there is objection to the proposed new section 158n, which requires that there shall be at least one-half of the members on the roll who shall <span class="highlight">vote</span> and there shall be one-half of those members who shall be in favour of the amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would hap pen if there were a union of say 8,000 members of whom 3,000 voted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that this is the common expertence of us all in regard to an election of a member to a committee in large bodies, when people simply do not <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I understand the position which the honourable gentleman places before me, he is querying the situation where for a variety of reasons there may not be a SO per cent <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also has had the opportunity of looking at the results of court controlled ballots which show that approximately 50 per cent, as I recall the figure, returned a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So on that basis it would be clear that a 50 per cent <span class="highlight">vote</span> cannot be regarded as an achievement of unusual dimension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it ought to be borne in mind also that this is a vital <span class="highlight">vote</span>, going as it does to the whole concept of the entity concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes it quite reason able to require a 50 per cent <span class="highlight">vote</span> before that organisation in fact can be wound up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be borne in mind also that that 50 per cent is not 50 per cent of those voting in favour; it is simply a 50 per cent <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the membership at that time, as defined in the provisions of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I include in that those on the Government side because they have the opportunity tonight to oppose this proposed section and <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was made known that the final <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It shows for the first time a long term commitment by Australia to the development of the countries in her region, these countries which in a great surge in the last couple of years have become independent members of the Commonwealth, members of the United Nations and neighbours who speak and <span class="highlight">vote</span> for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member is always here to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the gag or to keep us in this place after dark. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Forty-nine of them voted on this Bill and 56 of them voted about an hour ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That will mean that we will go home about 5 o’clock in the afternoon because they cannot stay here and <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said, 49 honourable members opposite took part in the last <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What will the number in the next <span class="highlight">vote</span> be? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Committee will look at this amendment on the basis of the best method of forming the council and will <span class="highlight">vote</span> on that basis and not on the basis of what could only be described as ‘simpleton parochialism of the worst type’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was generally considered that the Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill was not urgent and consequently that the Bill should not be taken to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the present position of Commonwealth-State negotiations, the second reading debate of that Bill will not at this stage be carried to a final <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, as has been set out by the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  - I think the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  understands this as well as I do - we proceed to the Australian Institute of Marine Science Bill and then to some limited debate on the Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill but to no <span class="highlight">vote</span>, that Bill will then go to the bottom of the notice paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an attempt to bring the Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill on in this House for a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the contingency motion will be voting to have the Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the contingency motion will be voting against the Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time the Government set up a committee to administer a research programme and the Commonwealth and Queensland governments each decided to <span class="highlight">vote</span> $35,000 in the first year for the research programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Grievance Day occurs only every second week; on alternate Thursdays General Business which never comes to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is dealt with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the right honourable member for higgins intends the word ‘resumed’ in his contingency motion to mean ‘resumed and finalised’, which means that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken in this House, the Bill goes to the Senate and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of this it is, I suggest, only sensible and wise that we should not bring this Bill to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us,  Mr Speaker,  have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it today, as the Government promised in its first batch of its legislation in this Parliament, and let members of the Government parties be reassured that a government cannot be defeated by passing a government Bill even if it is 2 years old. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this last moment and after the <span class="highlight">vote</span> has been taken on the motion for the adjournment of the debate on the Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill we find that the honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson)  and the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  have tried to re-open the matter again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case the <span class="highlight">vote</span> has already been taken, but all the arguments are being repeated on another procedural motion for the purpose of wasting time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that when the honourable member understands the full purport of the amendment that we have moved he will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they are sincere they will put their <span class="highlight">vote</span> where their words are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no other restriction outside radio and television; so it is no great effort for an advertising agency to switch the advertising <span class="highlight">vote</span> from one sector of the media to another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt where we stand on this matter, but I feel that it is  an  exercise in humbug to say that this is something less than a total ban and to say that there should be fair play - these statements came from honourable members  on  the Government benches - when in fact all Government supporters are pledged to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for something which, as we see it, is inequitable and may well be  a  farce and not in the interests of either country, media or of the health of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When you get to the stage where the Government is at the bottom of the barrel in public prestige, when the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  of this country can command about only 25 per cent of the votes, according to the gallup polls, it seems to me that this Government has not got its heart in discouraging people from smoking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When this Bill comes to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> I hope we will all act honestly and when the siren voices say to us: ‘You can get some money from us if you want provided you support our compaign*, I hope we will be like Ulysses and strap ourselves to the mast and refuse to be perverted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I express disappointment that the views expressed by the hon ourable member for Wakefield  (Mr Kelly)  - a distinguished member of this Parliament who occupies the position as  Chairman  of the Public Works Committee and who was a former Minister for the Government - in asking the Government to take another look at the Bill and not to force a <span class="highlight">vote</span> were not heeded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the people of every country should be free to choose the form of government that they wish, free from outside influence, in elections where any party has the opportunity and right to stand candidates; where any individual has the opportunity to offer himself as a candidate, if he wishes to do so; and where people have the right, by means of a secret ballot, to <span class="highlight">vote</span> as they please. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are currently engaged in debating a motion on which there is little likelihood of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> being taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On a previous occasion when votes were taken on this subject, the overwhelming number of members of the Parliament voted for the Capital Hill site. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the total Parliament been taken - and I think that was not an unreasonable thing to expect - a very substantial majority would have supported Capital Hill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They suddenly woke up to the fact that they have offended, and deeply offended, a large proportion of our migrant population, and that many of our migrant population, because they have chosen to become Australian citizens, have votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the reason for this exercise, which has been a rather crude, shallow attempt to retrieve the position and reach out for the migrant <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it is because migrants from those countries realise this - and the Leader of the Opposition has woken up to the fact that they realise it - that he has begun to become concerned about the migrant <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the coming election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact it dates back to that particular date, and plantings that have occurred in the interim, between July 1971 and now are covered by the special Treasury <span class="highlight">vote</span> as the honourable member is quite aware because this procedure was probably followed in his time when he was in the Department of National Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liberal senators in another place whom I have mentioned know that that is not the case because, for the same reasons as the Australian Labor Party, they will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against these proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for the Army  (Mr Katter),  speaking of certain Liberals who crossed the floor to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Country Party’s greatest gerrymander of all time, spoke in these terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was only because there was concern among the people in Australia about the negative attitude of the Australian Government’s spokesman in Stockholm, that the Australian Government changed its mind and decided to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The facts of life are that the honourable member for Bowman mentioned the votes of those 2 Parties and gave the impression that the Labor Party picked up all the rest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He is one who believes that whether it be 48 per cent, 38 per cent or 28 per cent, if his Party had a greater total <span class="highlight">vote</span> than another political party then his party should take the reins of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The position we are in is that the Minister has not supplied the information in response to my queries yet we are expected to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The honourable member must have in mind that, whilst the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> is purely a Commonwealth type <span class="highlight">vote</span>, the education budget of Australia is a shared one between the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would expect them to make a further increase of about the same order, which would give a total education <span class="highlight">vote</span>, additional to last year, approaching $300m, which is much greater than the actual increase in the’ defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the honourable member’s concern might have occurred because  Mr Hawke  indicated that the total defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> was more, or increasing at a greater rate, than the education <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> this year is estimated to be $l,323m and social welfare and repatriation are estimated to be $2,529m, making a total of $7,30 lm or about 70 per cent of the total Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does he consider that the widest possible exposure of policies and the fullest opportunity for electors to assess the personal presentation of their prospective representatives and Ministers is desirable in a democracy which depends on a popular <span class="highlight">vote</span> and freedom of the Press and other media? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, I expect that the honourable member will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not rather incongruous that yesterday in this Parliament the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  lauded the fact - and we must applaud it, too - that the wheat growers have been able to sell a million metric tons of wheat to Russia for $50m, while almost in the same breath, in the Budget the Government is saying that it must increase the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> because of the threat from the Russians in the Indian Ocean? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, the Government is finally reduced to mere <span class="highlight">vote</span> buying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable members to bear these facts in mind and to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this absurd amendment which 1 can describe only as being one that is lamentable because it is bereft of any intellectual integrity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the national scandals of this country is that a party with 8 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> can use the people’s revenue for its own political survival. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When my colleague the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  moved that the House should express the opinion by <span class="highlight">vote</span> that the Government should establish a national and independent public inquiry into poverty and all related areas of social need the Minister for Social Services was one of those who voted against the proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, it is the done thing now to quote, for instance, that the education <span class="highlight">vote</span> is now umpteen million dollars higher than it was in 1786 or some such magical period when nothing was happening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Turning to the defence provisions of the Budget we find that the <span class="highlight">vote</span> proposed is 1,323m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1971-72 these components of the defence budget absorbed about  76  per cent of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any savings brought by the cut in Army strength are likely to be more than offset by the flow-on from the Kerr Committee reports, so it seems that we can look forward to at least three-quarters of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> going on basic housekeeping costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Army has sustained its share of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> pretty well despite the end of Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most significant trend has been wilh the Royal Australian Air Force which got the same share of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in 1967-68. as the Army. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to support these observations by looking a little more closely at the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Army. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, the money can only come from direct taxation or by cutting down on the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>, because Labor proposes to give more money for everything else, across the whole spectrum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am asking the honourable member who is to follow me in this debate to do is to be completely honest and tell us where the money will come from, whether or not taxes will be increased and whether or not the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the ultimate test comes, when the Australian people realise the significance of the choice they make - responsibility in government or irresponsibility; that is the choice - people with normal cerebral processes should not be in doubt as to how they should <span class="highlight">vote</span> on that occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And incorporating those words in an amendment which was passed means it’s a very dangerous thing, because if this is followed by the caucus, as it should be, it means we will have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the wheat stabilisation bill, dairy industry, the various wool commitments, the Australian Wool Commission, all of these are subsidised industries that cannot stand on their feet under this criteria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The next question is: Does he support and <span class="highlight">vote</span> on ABC co-productions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be observed that I am seeking to have a debate and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Commonwealth Electoral Bill on which I made a second reading speech on 1 1th May, more than 4 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its sole purpose and consequence is to give the <span class="highlight">vote</span> to 18 year old, 19 year old and 20 year old men and women in elections for either House of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt that people have made up their minds on this issue and, accordingly, they should be ready to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, there can be no delay in implementing the Budget through a debate and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It might be said also that there would not be time for people gaining the <span class="highlight">vote</span> under this Bill to be enrolled for the House of Representatives election this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Western Australia the Act to give the <span class="highlight">vote</span> at 18 was proclaimed on Sth December 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Be that as it may, however, there are now 2 States in which 18, 19 and 20-year old men and women have the <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the State Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the last elections in the United Kingdom the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was exercised at 18. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course it has been available in the Netherlands and in a very great number of other countries in eastern Europe and Latin America for many years past but in all the countries with which Australia compares itself the <span class="highlight">vote</span> now is available at 18 and it should be possible for this Parliament to express its view promptly on this subject in time for 18, 19 and 20-year old men and women to have the suffrage at this year’s national elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter must be debated independently because the Government will not bring forward other legislation on electoral reform which would pemit members of the Opposition to move appropriate amendments to provide votes for 18-year-olds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many of those who are denied a <span class="highlight">vote</span> are engaged in the armed forces and have been called upon to fight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us express our views and give effect to the necessary reforms whereby the <span class="highlight">vote</span> may be available immediately to those 18-year olds in the electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The earlier we have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this to see where the Government stands the better for the Parliament and the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>i second the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition to suspend Standing Orders and, with members on this side, I will be interested to see whethers the real fear of defeat in the minds of members opposite is such that they will deny 600,000 to 700,000 citizens the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to determine whether in fact the 18, 19 and 20-year-olds want the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and, if a body of them does, whether we should make it compulsory for them to enrol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think we should be stampeding the young people, who have enough pressures including education pressures on them at this time, into a situation in which they are forced to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many cases parliamentarians feel obliged to try to impose upon people an obligation to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said: ‘Is it really a fact that this Government will allow us to go away and fight for our country at the age of 20 yet we cannot have a <span class="highlight">vote</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that these people get a <span class="highlight">vote</span> when they are in a war zone, but there are a  lot  of other people who do not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far more difficulties face the Commonwealth Electoral Office right now because in South Australia and Western Australia its officers have to make the distinction between people who can <span class="highlight">vote</span> in State elections and those who can <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a Federal election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They face far more difficulties than they would if the Minister did the proper thing and acceded to the overwhelming feeling in the country and allowed 18 year olds to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister may believe that such a <span class="highlight">vote</span> should not be compulsory, but why does he not allow it to be at least voluntary? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition has pointed out so correctly that the Government could agree to the Standing Orders being suspended to enable the debate to continue - I notice that the honourable member for Sturt  (Mr Foster)  has the call - and a quick <span class="highlight">vote</span> could be taken on the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime the Minister could bring forward an amendment which would enable his wish that the <span class="highlight">vote</span> be voluntary to be implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that if the Australian people are asked to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the coming election on the alternatives of the Labor Party policy or the policy of the Prime Minister they will be inclined to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Labor Party policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be satisfied to have the people <span class="highlight">vote</span> on that policy as compared to the Labor Party policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter was fully debated in the House of Commons in 2 full day debates in 1966 and the question of whether it would have a trial period of 6 months on closed circuit television was defeated by one <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a debate that resulted in a great deal of cross voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron)  always talks like a revolutionary when there is no possibility of testing a question by a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does he not stand up and support any progressive attitudes expressed from this side of the House when there is a chance of a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, such as on motions for the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be possible, especially on matters which are largely non-party, for private members’ Bills to be brought to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any honourable member who cared to pick up the notice paper and see the numbers of matters which are listed under general business and which will never be voted upon could see that an honourable member who wanted to list a general business item would not even have to think out the consequences because he knows that it will never be voted upon in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday the Minister for the Interior opposed my motion to suspend Standing Orders so that we could debate the <span class="highlight">vote</span> for 18-year-olds - a right given to men and women in most comparable countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later that day the House gave a whole afternoon to a futile debate on the question of a 35- hour working week although historically that is as inevitable as the <span class="highlight">vote</span> for 18- year-olds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances we will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the second reading but we will move an amendment in Committee to preserve the rights of persons who were affected by the proceedings outside this House on 20th and 23rd July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the second reading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the amendment is defeated we wm <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the third reading and in that case we will also <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Bill in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should explain that we will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the second reading because it is important that people who have acted under ordinances of the Australian Capital Territory and other territories, who have acted under regulations under Commonwealth Acts, and who have acted under instruments made by Ministers, should have their rights confirmed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless the House has said that it is to be done today, so we will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the second reading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for that ordinance if it came before this Parliament again but this afternoon I am asked to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say, and I hope it is supported by the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of this House, that the community should no longer tolerate the kind of governmental authority that is being exercised by the people sitting opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that enough honourable members opposite will abstain from voting or will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> with their Party on this issue to enable the measure to be defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Speaking on behalf of the part- Aborigines who live in the South Sydney area in my electorate of Sydney, I assure honourable members that they are absolutely disgusted with the action of this Government and that they will certainly <span class="highlight">vote</span> accordingly at the next election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not under any obligation to sit in this Parliament and put up my hand to <span class="highlight">vote</span> meekly for what I regard on occasions as a curious display of administrative talent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether they will have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is another matter, but the Liberal-Country Party Government is per sisting with its request that they be present and we will expect them to be able to express their views as fully as they wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the members of the Committee were truly reflecting the interest of the Australian people expressed a few years ago their <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a referendum proposal put to them by the Government, by which they expressed concern for the uplifting of the standards of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So I ask that rather than playing party politics and party numbers, honourable members opposite should quietly and seriously look at the full implications of the amendment and accept it and <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that it is important that somebody on the committee should have such a connection and look at things through the eyes of the vast number of people who <span class="highlight">vote</span> Labor in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one reflects on these figures, how absurd were the comments of some members of the Opposition when they said that the scheme was merely an expediency and that the Government was throwing money away as a bribe to induce people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Government when they would not otherwise have done so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>None of those is asking for an Australian schools commission, so I suggest, with due deference, that honourable members opposite - we are not in the <span class="highlight">vote</span> winning business, we are only talking about education - if they ever think of getting into the <span class="highlight">vote</span> winning business, should take account of who is interested in their proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This gentleman is now the Treasurer of the AMA and is using AMA funds, but this is not so bad because AMA members at least have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in respect of the disposal of their funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I cannot be sure what the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  meant by his comment but I certainly do not think that he meant that the Australian Medical Association, to a man, will now <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Labor Party because it supports our policy on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do the Articles of Association of the Fund provide that only medical members have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the election of its Council, that medical members shall be elected by the Council or by a committee appointed by the Council, that contributory members shall not be entitled to attend or <span class="highlight">vote</span> at any general meetings or to receive notice thereof and that 5 medical members personally present shall be a quorum of a general meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-31-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But when a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken in a committee it settles down onto a party basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Do supporters of the Government not recall that Australia led in the United Nations every movement, every motion and every resolution that came up to have the admittance of Communist China, the People’s Republic of China, to the United Nations regarded as an important question so that it could circumvent a simple majority decision of the United Nations and replace it by a twothirds <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so the Government has been obliged to consider whether a majority <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the House of Assembly conforms with the terms of the United Nations Charter which requires that self government be brought about in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In respect of the resolution on the timing of self government, I point out first that there was an interval of 2 months between the tabling of the motion and the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been alleged that for the next few months - until the <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Security Council is taken - the Soviet Union should not be antagonised and that the Department of Foreign Affairs has told the Department of Immigration that it should not be sympathetic to people whom the Soviet Union wants to exclude from membership of any outside nation - people whom it wants to get back into its own clutches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All the talk about ‘One <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value’ is a fallacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Lastly, I believe that we should give the people of the Northern Territory a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why should they be denied, as are the people of the Australian Capital Territory, a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Senate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Senate with the exception of the honourable member for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why should not the people of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory have a <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The demands made were, among other things, for a fully elected Legislative Council; ministerial responsibility and control over the executive and budgetary functions of government; an end to the Federal Government’s veto powers over Northern Territory legislation; Senate representation for the Territory; and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for Territorians in Commonwealth referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that some overenthusiastic party workers of various political parties appear to have stepped outside the law in seeking postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> applications but it is difficult to get sufficient evidence to prosecute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an offence to persuade or induce an elector to make an application for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This, of course to some extent will reduce the need for postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> applications, but I grant that efforts must be made to amend the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I turn now to the question of votes for 18-year olds and to what the Minister for the Interior said in August 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the 18-year old <span class="highlight">vote</span> I quote from the statement by the Minister for the Interior, who said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So let us get that point fixed clearly in our minds before we <span class="highlight">vote</span> upon this proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would quite willingly <span class="highlight">vote</span> for an acquisition scheme if I thought it would give me either a higher price for my wool or greater handling economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we will just see how good those honourable members are when it comes to the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I feel sure that if a properly co-ordinated acquisition scheme were to be implemented by the corporation and agreed to by the bulk of wool growers the States would not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against such a proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When he took it to Cabinet the Liberals would <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it and the few Country Party members might vole for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>You oppose things outside the House and <span class="highlight">vote</span> for them in the house, but when have you voted against your own party in this House? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is for this reason that the Labor Party insists that the Financial Agreement should be recast to give local and semi-government authorities - that is, councillors and aldermen in each State - the right to choose a representative to speak and <span class="highlight">vote</span> for them on the Australian Loan Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can understand the dilemma of the honourable member for Macarthur who is trying probably to squeeze a <span class="highlight">vote</span> out of the situation by rushing in here in a state of panic to move for discussion of a matter of public importance 23 years late. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">vote</span> must be taken and I hope that many members of the Liberal Party and the Country Party will come to their senses on this matter and will <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a positive way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the basis of that categorical assurance I voted for the adjournment of the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That brings me to say at once that no device will be available to any person and no resourcefulness of mind will be able to contrive a stratagem which will encourage me to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this matter being resolved today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Bill? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is an international truism which applies to the Australian States, the States of the United States of America, the Canadian Provinces and the German Lander, lt is the Federal people, for better or for worse, who have the sole right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and speak at any international gathering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We then looked on several occasions at what should be done, and we had several Cabinet submissions about it, culminating in the fact some months later that we would in fact supply aircraft to Cambodia, and I made a statement to the House on the supply of the aircraft to Cambodia after we had decided on 2 other occasions not only to increase the <span class="highlight">vote</span> but also to supply items of dual purpose equipment - for example, telecommunications equipment - and also to provide motor vehicles and later on to provide other different kinds of equipment, and then I made the statement relating to the DC3 aircraft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the pay of servicemen and civilians is shown at $605m for 1972-73; this figure is projected forward by simply adding $5m for each of the subsequent years, so we wind up with a total of $625m in 1976-77. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#debate-9">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When we are embarking on a purchase for our forces at a cost of about $3S0m, does the Government suggest that we should <span class="highlight">vote</span> blindly on such an issue? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#debate-9">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The enormous expenditure of $ 1,300m which is, as I have said, an increase of $100m over last year’s <span class="highlight">vote</span>, is to be shared among the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#debate-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, the whole exercise of the midnight Cabinet meetings and so on have been devoted to trying to get the dissident Government supporters not to put their votes where their mouths have so often been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I sincerely look forward, and I am sure a great percentage of the Australian people do, to the introduction of a true sense of democracy into the voting procedures of this country so that we will accept the principle of ‘one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With only 19 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Queensland, the Country Party holds a major share of power in the coalition Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They fully realise that they should accept the challenge that the Labor Party will extend to them to bring democracy into the electoral procedures of this nation and accept the challenge of supporting a system of electoral reform that will give voters in the cities a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the same value as the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of people who live in some other parts of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that when the proposed electoral reforms are introduced into this Parliament, and when one-<span class="highlight">vote</span> one-value is an accomplished fact, there might be some opportunity for the Government to use its influence on those discredited State governments that depend upon the gerrymander for their own continuation in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>True it is that the Prime Minister should share with every other member of this House the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on any matter which might come before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words, they cannot always be immediately available to come into the House to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I share with the honourable member for Prospect a concern at the manner in which the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the House adopt this proposal and I do so because, as I have said, it is essential that the House provide rules that make it absolutely certain that every honourable member has the opportunity, if he wishes to do so, to be in the House and <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time I thought I would enable every honourable member from the Prime Minister down to have the right to be in the chamber and <span class="highlight">vote</span> when necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the House to support the motion and give away one minute in the interests of restoring democracy to the Parliament and  maintaining the rights of members to <span class="highlight">vote</span> here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No matter how honourable members opposite <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the proposal, I will be interested to scrutinise lists later to see how many of them arrange pairs if debates continue after 11 o’clock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members undoubtedly will know more than I do about the ICI strike but it is my understanding that when a <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken the workmen agreed to return to work - indeed, they wanted to return to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The nice gerrymander that prevented Labor from taking office in 1954 and 1961 when it gained the majority of the 2-party preferred <span class="highlight">vote</span> operated again during the last election so that Labor required 52.7 per cent of the 2- party preferred <span class="highlight">vote</span> to gain office, whilst our opponents could have retained office with 48.5 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is why the electoral measures which will come before us for detailed discussion shortly are so important - these measures will embody the principle that a majority of the people of Australia through their <span class="highlight">vote</span> can make and break governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We agree wholeheartedly with the undeniable logic of those sentiments, while at the same, time noting that this was one of the rare occasions on which the Prime Minister has given credit where it was properly due, for it is without question that the period of successive Liberal-Country Party governments covered the entire lives of those people who are now to be granted the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 18-year-old literates of Equador and the 18-year-old male Jordanians - but not Bedouins - can <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many people have said: ‘If you are old enough to die for your country, you are old enough to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for your country.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be the right of all 18, 19 and 20-year-olds, who have physically matured earlier and who do bear arms in the historic and present sense, to have that <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But with better education, which does not come entirely from the school but through the media, these people are better equipped to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> at that age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are all reasons why we can regard people of 18 to 21 years as being as well equipped as 21 year olds to <span class="highlight">vote</span> responsibly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been argued that young people are not interested in politics and that people who do not care should not <span class="highlight">vote</span>, but in my opinion that is not an argument against extending the <span class="highlight">vote</span> to 18-year-olds but against compulsory voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principal argument on which to base a decision, to give people the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> before 21 years of age should be that, mature or not, they are in fact becoming increasingly involved personally in social, financial, industrial, cultural and political issues of importance and that to take a meaningful and responsible part in society they must have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would be to them a challenge to develop the awareness that is necessary to play an articulate political role in the community - responsibilities far too often shunned by people who have the <span class="highlight">vote</span> solely because they are 21 or older. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that youth was forced to move away from the normal democratic process and toward direct action when they did not have the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has not at any time taken issue on or implied opposition to the principle of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the 18-year-olds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there was the need to overcome a number of technical problems before we felt that we could move to lower the franchise age to enable 18, 19 and 20- year-olds to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the last House of Representatives elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most elementary consideration in any franchise system is that it should be clear and fair and that the circumstances in which the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> is to be exercised should be uniform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, on 8th March last year, when the then Prime Minister was asked a question in this House on the matter, he told the Parliament that the law would not be changed in time to give 18- year-olds a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the then forthcoming elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to his remark that there has not been any really emotional demand by the great body of the 18, 19 and 20-year-olds to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Once having enrolled, of course, it is compulsory for them to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While I was the Minister for the Interior a number of parents made representations to me as Minister and also as the member for Gwydir, objecting very strongly to young people being forced to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, in other words, being forced into a position where they would have to make political decisions as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that any us was taken in because we knew at the time that the then Government had run out of steam, that it was in electoral trouble, as events subsequently proved to be correct, and that rather than take a chance or gamble on the unkown namely, whether the then Government would have any support from the young people df Australia, it shelved the proposal to give 18- year-olds a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and put it aside as being not worthy of the risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Government could have introduced legislation giving 18-year-olds a <span class="highlight">vote</span> at any time during this 5-year period, but it chose not to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that on 2nd December, the election day, I was followed on my visits to polling booths by 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20-year-olds who could not <span class="highlight">vote</span> but who expressed support for the need for a change of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It pointed out that the swing of 3 per cent which gave the Australian Labor Party SO per cent of the first preference votes in the Federal election held on 2nd December was caused mostly by a 6 per cent gain by the Australian Labor Party amongst voters aged 21 to 29. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the reason, as I suggested at the outset, why the previous Liberal PartyCountry Party Government refused to give them the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wish to mention briefly now the effect that the Bill willi have on the number of people entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The enactment of this legislation will mean that if an election were held tomorrow the number of eligible voters in the Australian Capital Territory would jump from about 83,000 people - which is already by far the largest number of voters in any electorate in Australia - to approximately 93,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increase in the number of eligible voters in the Northern Territory would be about 6,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it is simply a matter of viewing this legislation on the basis of giving 18-year-olds the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are given the <span class="highlight">vote</span> the decision itself may vary or it may not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know he could not read all the details but he made some reference to the statement - I feel it is a hackneyed statement - that if you are old enough to fight for your country then you are old enough to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This afternoon the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch)  closed his address on the Bill by saying that the Opposition agrees that the time has arrived when 18-year-olds should be given the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and it supports the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will give the <span class="highlight">vote</span> to men and women at 18 years of age, as is already done in all other federal systems and most English-speaking countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Country Party expects to form political branches in high schools and universities when the 18-year-old <span class="highlight">vote</span> is introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We certainly will encourage the political enlightenment of our young people, whether they are eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span> or simply approaching that eligibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of the 5,321 students 72.5 per cent indicated that they would prefer to see permission to <span class="highlight">vote</span> granted to 18-year-olds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By the next election the <span class="highlight">vote</span> for 18-year-olds will be an accomplished fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that the addition of votes of 18-year-olds in the electorate of Griffith will bring about a significant change in the result of that electorate, as I expect that there will be significant changes in the results in many other electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are debating the Bill which was introduced by the Government to give the <span class="highlight">vote</span> to young people aged 18, 19 and 20. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is some guidance on this matter from the controversy that arose in Britain a short time ago when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> for young people of 18, 19 and 20 was introduced in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>politics, civics and constitutional subjects to deal with the teaching of young people who would very shortly, in a year or two afterwards, have the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the parties involved, and I suggest that as the 18-year-old <span class="highlight">vote</span> is now imminent the Australian Education Council, that is to say the body of Federal and State Ministers for Education, should give earnest consideration to it, that the leaders of the political parties should be involved in this, and the authorities that conduct the schools, whether they be State education authorities or authorities governing private schools; and, of course, the teachers themselves are concerned with the integration into their courses on government of politicians with due balance being preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me from all of the debate I have heard in the short time I have been in this House around this whole question of the franchise for people that I have hot yet heard a’ very sound argument why : 18-year-old people in this country should not have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, after they have enrolled, they must <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said there had been no clamour from the 18-year-olds to be given the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people could see a threat to their position if 18-year-olds were in fact able to come forward and cast their votes as to who should be governing this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that why it has opposed giving the <span class="highlight">vote</span> to 18-year-olds in the past? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, they can now come out as heroes and say: ‘We support giving the <span class="highlight">vote</span> to 18-year-olds and we always have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock)  quoted from a committee report and claimed that the argument that because a man was old enough to fight and die for his country, he should automatically gain the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> was fallacious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the proposition that 18-year-olds should be enabled to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it were suggested that the voting age should be 14 years I probably would agree with that, because 1 do not know that there is any proper yardstick by which to determine at which age people should have the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 would not give some members sitting opposite a <span class="highlight">vote</span> even if they were 75 years of age because they just do not have the mental capacity to sort things out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people are given the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> it is obligatory on the whole system to give them the further right to discuss the matters upon which they <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Also my daughter, who is already 18 years of age, looks like getting her first <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have persuaded him to my point of view that 18-year- olds should have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the last election, despite a termendous effort on behalf of the electoral officers concerned, was 5 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The electoral officers -  Mr Lee  and the men in that Department - are to be congratulated for the effort they made to educate people, mainly Aborigines, to be able to <span class="highlight">vote</span> with  preference  cards listing 6 or 7 candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As there was a 5 per cent or greater informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the last election, I ask the Ministers responsible for this matter to start now to teach not only Aborigines but also  young men  and women down to the age of 18, or as the honourable member for Burke  (Mr Keith Johnson)  suggested, down to the age of 14 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well to give them a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, but the essential thing is to teach them what to do with it and how they can best help their own interests, whether this is to be achieved by voting for the Australian Labor Party or the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My message to the Minister is that the people who have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> should be educated in the exercise of their rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear suggestions that young people at 18 might not be old enough to <span class="highlight">vote</span> because they are not aware of what is required, but 1 say that the attitude of the majority of youth today puts the lie to that sort of suggestion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The disqualification of voters because of age by conservatives was consistent with their attitude to adult franchise and falls into a category similar to their opposition to the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking in retrospect at the opposition to electoral reform - giving the <span class="highlight">vote</span> to the young people of Australia - and listening to the debate that has taken place today, it appears to me that the defeat of the then Western Australian Government - not a Labor government - after lowering the voting age brought fear of defeat to the Liberal-Country Party governments in other States and in the Federal sphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would like to put on record my congratulations to Don Dunstan and his team for the wonderful victory in South Australia, a State in which a Labor government has given youth the opportunity to express a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and where the intelligent youth of Australia has been treated in a similar way to that handed out by other progressive countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The granting of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> to 18-year-olds has always been seen to have implications over a wide range of public, legal and traditional attitudes, that is, the whole age of majority question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The rapidity with which our education system has grown to bring a vastly expanded educative level to young Australians has made it possible for us to entrust the <span class="highlight">vote</span> to 18- year-olds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When campaigning in New South Wales, from which the honourable member comes,  I  asked people in meetings how they had voted at the last Legislative Council elections in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About fourfifths of the people concerned thought they had voted, but of course not a soul in New South Wales has a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the upper House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And this applies also to the constituting city government throughout Australia; in some of our States most of the residents have no <span class="highlight">vote</span> and some of the residents have 8 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One or two of these were taken up firmly by my colleagues, notably the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock),  who disposed completely of the old argument that, if a man is old enough to fight for his country, he should have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People will be able to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at 1 8 years of age, but we do not pretend that on their 18th birthday they suddenly become endowed with wisdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at present the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at 18 is not contested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can use all the emotional arguments that were used in favour of allowing people of 1 8, 19 and 20 years of age to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, in favour of allowing people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at 17, 16 or some other age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that a deal of simulated emotion on the rights of young people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> does not really carry the argument forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we give someone the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> we are demanding, because voting is compulsory, that he makes a judgment about the parties and the candidate he feels will act best on his behalf and in the interests of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought to remember that, in making it compulsory for all 18, 19 and 20-year-olds to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, we must have regard for the position of the average young person and not merely that of the high school and university students who may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>do not think we would expect all those judgments to be correct and all that experience to be so wide that it would necessarily lead to the right decision or the right <span class="highlight">vote</span> being made in given circumstances, but 1 think we would all say that the motives of young people have improved greatly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to add to the point that has been alluded to, and that is that if we concede, agree or promote that 18, 19 and 20-year-olds have the right and the obligation to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, thus regarding them as adults, we should not look at the matter in isolation and say that they can have the <span class="highlight">vote</span> but nothing else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We seek only to introduce and perpetuate, as far as possible, the principle of ‘one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value’ and to ensure that the result will reflect the opinion of the majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To this end we intend to amend the law so that, as far as may be practicable, the value of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of one citizen shall be equivalent to the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general, the 1965 amendments diluted the value of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in metropolitan areas and weighted it in favour of rural areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We never accepted them as providing a proper basis for redistribution, nor do we accept the proposition that the relative value of a person’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> should depend upon his geographical location. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The changes proposed by this Bill will give some meaning to the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value’ without unnecessarily restricting the Distribution Commissioners in application of the factors when effecting redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because everyone entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> must enrol, precise details are always available of the number of electors in a particular area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am entirely in favour of the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, and, when the relevant Bill comes before this House in the next sessional period I shall support that principle with my voice and with my <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions are in truth the complete negation of the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee agreed on the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value and recommended that the quota should not vary more than onetenth either way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party has consistently supported the principle of equality of representation in a Parliament and in 1961, 1962, 1965 and 1968 when electoral redistributions were under consideration, moved amendments for the variation to be reduced to 10 per cent and give effect to the Committee’s findings of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every worthwhile authority supports the case for one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, and equality of electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legislators are elected by voters, not farms or cities or economic interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the extent that a citizen’s right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> is debased, he is that much less a citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The weight ot a citizen’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> cannot be made to depend on where he lives’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of an elector in any one State shall be no more or no less valuable than the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of an elector in any other State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This principle, enshrined in the Constitution, was destroyed by the Liberal-Country Party in 1965 by its amendments to section 19, making it possible for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of an elector in one division of a State to be as much as one and a half limes as valuable as the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of an elector in another division in the same State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> of one person, whatever his occupation or location, should be as good as the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Country Party has never polled more than 10.9 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span> at any House of Representatives election from 1949; yet it has invariably held anything from IS to 20 seats in a House of 124 and 6 portfolios in a Ministry of between 20 and 25. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, while polling only 10 per cent of the public <span class="highlight">vote</span>, it exercises a parliamentary <span class="highlight">vote</span> of between 16 and 17 per cent and a Ministerial influence of more than 20 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To bring the Country Party right up to date I state that at the 1972 elections the Country Party polled 9.44 per cent of the votes, won 20 seats and has 16 per cent voting strength in the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a totally different story to the elections of 1954 when the Australian Labor Party polled 50.03 per cent against the combined Liberal-Country Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> of 47.07 per cent and yet was defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1961 the Labor Party polled 2,534,702 votes, or 46.76 per cent of the votes, and in 1969 polled 2,870,792 or 46.95 per cent of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Labor had followed the same pattern as Country Party it would have needed only 20 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> to win. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to Queensland, this bastion of selected democracy where the Country Party reigns; where redistribution of boundaries has been the scorn of the Party since 1958; where it is possible for the Labor Party to gain 46.75 per cent of the votes, more than the combined votes of the Liberal and Country parties (42.23 per cent) and to win only 33 seats as against 47 for the Government parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that State the Country Party, with the lowest total <span class="highlight">vote</span> - the lowest percentage of the votes (20 per cent) - won 26 seats to the Liberal Party’s 21 with 22.23 per cent of votes, against 33 by Labor with 46.75 per cent of total votes cast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Country Party which polled a minority of votes, and a minority of the percentage of the votes, holds the Premiership of the State of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill underlines the Government’s belief that a person’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> is of equal value no matter where he lives or whatever his occupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives to those who sit in this Parliament the opportunity to say whether they believe in these democratic principles and the equal rights of all electors, or whether they stand for manipulation of the Electoral Act to retain governments of their political colour irrespective of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Act, if members of the Country Party who are interjejcting will be silent for the fleeting remainder of my speech, is a challenge to those who sit opposite to stand up and be counted on the fundamental democratic principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value and majority rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 might say that when the Australian representatives rise at the United Nations to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and indicate our ratification they can be fortified by the fact that this decision was unanimous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that on this day, 13th March, if we <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the motion that the Bill be read a third time, we will do so unanimously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contrary to the view of my Leader, I believe that perhaps there should be a little bit of politics in this debate, because in my view the Australian Labor Party in the election campaign promised to remove the sales tax on contraceptives to appeal for the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of women in the electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It surrendered to pressure groups such as the Women’s Electoral Lobby and Zero Population Growth and sought by doing that to obtain support from women voters who thought that that was all that was involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The consent of the States is being sought to alter the 1927 financial agreement to allow local government in each State to choose a representative to speak and <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it in the deliberations of the Loan Council, as the Governor-General announced 3 weeks ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This member charged me with spending the whole of that day using the facilities of this place, the telephone primarily, to contact people in Adelaide in order to influence the way in which my Party conference would <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that any party that advocates one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value should also be prepared to provide equal opportunity for all people to receive, for example, the benefits of television, and at least the benefits of telephonic communication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the present Parliament resumed the present Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  selected him, I think, for a shadow Ministry, but subsequently the Liberal Party had a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on who should be on the front bench and now the honourable member is back in the back blocks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From what the Prime Minister has said it is apparent to me that to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this amendment would hold up the Bill and would hold up the payment of what I believe to be a fair and proper remuneration to members of this House and the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know whether there are to be other speakers in this debate; but, in case there are and as 1 am most anxious that this matter be brought to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> today and that a decision be taken, 1 conclude by saying that I fully support the motion as amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I want to make it clear, while I support the amendment on this limited basis, that, perhaps in contrast to earlier speakers, 1 will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the proposition only in the terms in which it is presented - that is, inviting an inquiry by a committee and certainly nothing more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The exception, of course, is on the occasional free <span class="highlight">vote</span> question that it is significant that attendance at these times is always large and participation always keen even where the issue itself is quite minor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is most important for this House, and the fact that he is supporting the principle of private members business coming to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is, indeed, something which T believe we should all commend and support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I say that we recognise that by their <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the last election many Australians have demonstrated a belief that they thought the Australian Labor Party was likely to bring about some of these adjustments which the people thought were necessary or at least that Labor would try to bring them about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Out of the 6 members of the Commission 2 did not <span class="highlight">vote</span>, 2 voted in favour of putting duties on all future shipments of canned pears to the United States and 2 voted against paying duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the rules of that body, although no majority decision was reached, because there was a tied <span class="highlight">vote</span>, in effect all future deliveries of canned pears to that country will be subject to anti-dumping duties even though the case was not proved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Particularly, will the committee be muzzled by a majority <span class="highlight">vote</span> when it wants to look at the direction of foreign policy and, in particular, when it wants to look at the major scandal of the last few months when - without a mandate, because these things were not mentioned in the election campaign - the Government has changed sides for Australia and now wants to put us into the communist as against the free world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter came to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and amongst those who voted against the then Opposition amendment, the Australian Labor Party amendment, were the present Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden),  the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition and the former Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Lowe  (Mr McMahon). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether today, when this Bill comes to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this House, they will have the courage again to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the granting of 4 weeks leave to Commonwealth public servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Attributed to a former Labor Minister and  Senator was  the saying: 1 don’t care who votes or how they <span class="highlight">vote</span> so long as I count them’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another old saying attributed to a Labor Party leader of the past, was: ‘<span class="highlight">Vote</span> early and <span class="highlight">vote</span> often’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument advanced by the Government to support this measure is based on the slogan: ‘One <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that Australians will see through the motives and will accept our view that the Bill should be defeated in order to preserve that very thing which the Minister has been using as his slogan - equality of treatment and, as near as possible, one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our purpose is to maintain, as far as is practicable and fair, the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have not looked past the superficialities to find the best way to ensure equity and one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it succeeded in this Bill it would injure fair treatment and damage one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without sufficient tolerance the arbitrary rigidity and constraint will reduce the franchise of one individual and improperly increase the franchise of another, and that will be a specific abandonment of the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  10  per cent tolerance does not allow sufficiently for movements through the quota to maintain the best approximation to one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If all divisions could be drawn so that their votes were equal they would be greatly less than equal within months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  10  per cent tolerance clearly would frustrate the efforts of distribution commissioners in their responsibility of taking population into account and attempting to achieve, on an average through a reasonable period, the best approximation to one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Half of the members in this House are elected by people who do not even know the names of the members and if they saw them they surely would not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australian Federal election results have been as close as could realistically be expected to reflecting the will of the Australian voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only once since 1949 has the party or group of parties with the highest percentage of <span class="highlight">vote</span>* failed to capture government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One non-metropolitan voter in New South Wales, for instance - and there s little difference in this respect between New South Wales and other States - has a <span class="highlight">vote</span> value equal to 1.06 compared with metropolitan voters or 1 .04 if Darling is excluded from the calculations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These figures are derived as follows: 17 extra-metropolitan divisions in New South Wales, including Darling, cast 875,069 formal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an average of 51,475 formal votes per division, including Darling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Excluding that division’s votes, there were 834,369 formal votes cast in the other 16 divisions, giving an average of 52,148 votes per division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Twenty-eight metropolitan divisions cast 1,531,877 formal votes or 54,709 per division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, 51,475 extrametropolitan voters equalled 54,709 metropolitan voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expressed another way, one extrametropolitan voter has a <span class="highlight">vote</span> value equal to 1.06 metropolitan voters or 1.04 if Darling is excluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value is designed to prevent a geographical area or a sectional group being given a representation in the national Parliament which would enable its interests to achieve a greater influence in the mix of political decisions than is appropriate to their size. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can a <span class="highlight">vote</span> value of .06 above their city cousins be seriously regarded as a gross democratic distortion? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree totally with Chief Justice Warren that as nearly as practicable one man’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> should be worth as much as another’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 say again that our record in achieving majority government and approximation of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value throughout our history has not been surpassed by any world standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, in the last election the Labor Party polled fewer votes in proportion than the percentage of seats it holds in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the Leader of the Opposition made Party points about how parties preserve electoral systems I am reminded that in the State of Western Australia, from which he came originally, the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a metropolitan seat in the lower House there had a value of one, a country seat had a value of three and a northwestern seat had the value of six. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What they stand by solidly is malapportionment to make sure that the votes, at any rate of the Country Party segment, will always have a much greater value than those of anybody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the South Australian electoral controversy was raging, one spokesman of the country segment of the Liberal Country League came out with the brilliant statement: ‘Why should a metropolitan drink waiter have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> the same value as the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of a soldier settler battling in the backblocks to create a new farm?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then, most awfully, nickel was discovered at Kambalda and within a few years there was a town with a population of some 5,000 people with 2,500 voters on the roll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps 70 per cent of these voted Labor, or enough to ensure the seat rolled over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the last State election in Western Australia the Liberal Party won 29.3 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>, the Australian Country Party won 5 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and with 34.3 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> between them, naturally they lost the election by only one seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were below the Playfordesque point of 35 per cent, and he had created  a  situation in South Australia in which a country <span class="highlight">vote</span> had 4 times the value of a city <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Westminster system where there will be monopoly of power for that side which has the majority of seats, there is a very clear moral obligation to ensure, so far as it is humanly possible, that the side which has the majority of seats has had the majority of votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that section 24 of the Constitution ensures that representation of the States in the House of Representatives shall be in proportion to their respective populations and therefore the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of an elector in any one State shall be no more or no less valuable than the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of electors in other <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Constitution does not provide for equal value of votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister in such an important matter as the second reading speech makes untrue statements and ignores the situation in Tasmania where a wide departure from the one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value principle is condoned and accepted and not even questioned by the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party has been utterly rejected by country voters in Victoria and therein lies the explanation of Labor’s determination to force through these proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But is it the mathematical value of a person’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> that should be the be all and end all or is it the value of representation he is able to receive in this Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equality of representation should be seen to be far more important than mere mathematical equality of votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is saying there should be one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, yet he is taking action that will speed up the creation of imbalance between electorates - a situation which then, he says, will not be rectified by more frequent redistributions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So here we have a situation in which the law calls for the one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value principle to be followed, yet the commissioners regard a variation between 40,000 and 80,000 voters as being an acceptable practical application of that principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In their reports in 1947 and 1954, the commissioners in Britain took the view that, in general terms, urban electorates could more conveniently support large numbers of voters than could rural electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Labor argues that it is wrong for a country <span class="highlight">vote</span> to have more mathematical value than a city <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is just as wrong for a city <span class="highlight">vote</span> to have more practical value than a country <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The city member is able to devote far more time to his constituents and give them far more personal attention, and therefore a higher proportion of representation in a practical sense than can the country member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is not that a very interesting comment coming from the Leader of the Australian Country Party which has 9 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the history of the Federation it has not had more than 10 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>And then we go to some of the more dramatic conservative areas of Tasmania where they hold the city <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very interesting that in one of the areas in this State to which the Leader of the Country Party drew attention there is a mayor who sits with no fewer than 28 formal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the State of Queensland we have the situation of a Premier who rules with that great mandate of 19 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liberal Party supports the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In doing so we recognise that the effectiveness of policies relating to voter distribution can be measured by the degree to which the size of electorates tends towards this ideal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do so because the present Act has effectively ensured the practical adherence to the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value and in doing so it has produced electoral justice as judged by that criterion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The one exception, moreover, was in 1954 when the Labor Party and the parties supporting it managed to secure about 51.27 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> but failed to capture government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have heard a speech which ill befits an honourable member who represents a party which begins all its electoral speeches by professing its belief in the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, but in practice it is demonstrably in favour of a principle which elects conservative members to Parliament, irrespective of how necessary it is to rig electoral boundaries in order to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When did one Liberal Party member of this Parliament stand up and outline the situation in the Upper House of South Australia where a party able to obtain 35 per cent of the votes is able to obtain 80 per cent of the seats? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not a bad gerrymander for a party which claims that every <span class="highlight">vote</span> should be equal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words the honourable member for Wimmera is supporting a proposition where every elector in his electorate has 2 votes in this Parliament to the one <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the honourable member for Diamond Valley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Country Party’s majority was in the Upper House and the Liberals, with their 35 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Victoria, had an absolute majority in the Lower House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They still do, and they still have only about 55 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, if a redistribution does not take place before the next elections we will have a situation where in one electorate a <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be worth more than twice as much as a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in another electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is not unreasonable that a person should have the expectation that when he goes to the place where he casts his <span class="highlight">vote</span> that <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be of the same value as the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of another person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think it is unreasonable that when a person goes to the ballot box he shall have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> which is valued according to the electorate in which he lives, not the country in which he lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My own electorate has been growing at the rate of 7,000 additional voters a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To get as close to one <span class="highlight">vote</span> equal value as possible a greater percentage is necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, some of the legislation introduced and decisions taken by the Government, such as increased social security and repatriation payments and the provision of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> to 18-year-olds, are worthy of support; while some decisions on unilateral currency revaluation, foreign policy and industrial matters have concerned the nation, including many people who voted for the Labor Party at the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They have said that the Australian Labor Party has only once gained the major <span class="highlight">vote</span> at an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They want to be able to say that the system of voting they prefer is the preferred <span class="highlight">vote</span>, but when they quote figures to suit their argument they use the primary <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In most elections, except for a few, the Labor Party has won on the primary <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members opposite wish to assess the results of elections on a primary <span class="highlight">vote</span> basis, let us have first past the post voting and let us have none of this nonsense with which they are carrying on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a preferred party voting system; that is the system under which we operate and that is the way we should calculate which party received the major <span class="highlight">vote</span> at an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall quote to honourable members figures on the 2-party preferred <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the last 5 or 6 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1958 the Liberal and Country Parties received 54.1 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> compared to the 45.9 per cent received by the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1961 the Liberal and Country Parties received 49.5 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> while the Labor Party received 50.5 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1963 52.6 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> went to the Liberal and Country Parties - honourable members opposite were entitled to win then- and 47.4 per cent went to the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1966, on a 2-party preferred <span class="highlight">vote</span> basis, the Liberal and Country Parties received 56.9 percent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> compared to the 43.1 per cent received by the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in 1969 the Liberal and Country Parties received 49.8 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> compared to the 50.2 per cent received by the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1972, 47.3 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> went to the Liberal and Country Parties, while 52.7 per cent went to the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, including 1954, which has been quoted by honourable members opposite and conceded by us, the Labor Party, on a 2-party preferred <span class="highlight">vote</span> basis - remember that that is the system under which we operate; preferential voting - the Labor Party should have won 3 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Once one breaks with the principle that in a democratic society every man’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> should be of equal value one runs into all kinds of anomalies and contradictions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accept the proposition and 1 believe that if we tell the people of Australia, as we are doing, about it they will accept this proposition that one man, one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value is the only principle that any democratic society possibly can accommodate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is sincere in its desire to achieve a true one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, then it should commence to alter the constitution whereby each State shall have equal Senate representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister if this is what he refers to as equal voting, ls this one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that there is no merit in the argument for one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value put forward by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Working on the assumption that one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value was not used during the campaign in country areas, as was the enlarging of country electorates - I am sure that there were very few, if any, used it - I believe it is now up to the Prime Minister to go to the people on this very question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had the position where electorates in the areas thai supported the Australian Country Party contained small numbers, while the provincial cities, which overwhelmingly voted Labor, were given either one electorate or two, irrespective of the size of those cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any member of the Liberal Party who votes for a gerrymander that favours the Country Party votes against his interests, the interests of the Liberal Party and the interests of people who <span class="highlight">vote</span> Liberal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It portends a sad future for the Liberal Party, because people will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a party that will not get up and fight for what it believes in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party, in its platform, its policy and its expression of views on many occasions in this Parliament has stood for a principle approaching one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These people do not have a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons why the Labor Party has done so well in South Australia and continues to do so well is that eventually, after many years of gerrymandered electorates in that State, as a result of which the people could not carry out their wishes through the ballot box by electing a government, feeling built up to the extent that Labor in South Australia attracted a <span class="highlight">vote</span> which is among the highest in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people who voted against the Labor Party at elections have done so because of fears that have been built up about the Labor Party, the fear that allegedly it would destroy the American alliance, sell out Australia to Peking and Moscow, and destroy all morality in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent elections many people have voted other than Labor because they believed some of the things that were spread about by Labor’s political opponents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people have voted for the Democratic Labor Party or for the Australia Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they like the Labor Party they will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people who last time voted for the Australia Party next time will probably choose between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know whether Professor Aitkin’s study was right, but it suggests that many people who have voted for the DLP in recent times have been estranged Liberal voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that at the next election that section of the DLP <span class="highlight">vote</span> will sort itself out between the Labor Party and one of the other major political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe they are doing this in the belief that if they mutter slogans like ‘one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value’ at the same time as they talk about the 20 per cent margin and draw attention to the fact that the Electoral Commissioners are required to have some regard to problems of area and distance, a sense of injustice will be created in the minds of the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In New South Wales, for instance, if a metropolitan <span class="highlight">vote</span> is worth one then an extra metropolitan <span class="highlight">vote</span> is worth 1.04 if we exclude the electorate of Darling, and 1.06 if we include Darling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can point to the practice of using the 20 per cent margin where appropriate to achieve substantial equality in voters between divisions at mid term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point 1 am making is that when the Australian Labor Party got the votes under the existing system in 1972 it got the numbers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What it now wants to do is to so arrange things that it gets the numbers when it does not get the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the reason for the Labor Party’s hymn of hate against the rural voter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every single member on the other side of the House who has spoken in this debate, from the Minister for Services and property  (Mr Daly)  down, has engaged in this hymn of hate against the rural voter of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are doing this in an attempt to arouse a sense of injustice amongst metropolitan voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are trying to brainwash us into believing that there is electoral injustice and that this is caused by some sort of preferential treatment which is being given to country voters that in some way reduces the value of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the metropolitan elector and the weight that he has in determining the government of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realise that many city dwellers resident in my electorate do not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I assure these Australian people who are city dwellers, particularly those living in the Lilley electorate, that I shall not be a party to selling them short and downgrading the value of their <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s move to get rid of Clem Jones by ending the separate Lord Mayoral <span class="highlight">vote</span> in yesterday’s City Council election proved a dismal flop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tha people of Brisbane answered by giving Clem’s team the biggest <span class="highlight">vote</span> triumph in Australian election history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to newspaper reports,  Mr Martin  also called on the State Parliamentary Liberal Party to press for a new redistribution, taking more into account the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Martin  also is reported to have stated that when there is a situation where there is a difference of more than 250 per cent between the number of voters in one electorate and the number in another, there is justification for people to say that Queensland is a  Cinderella  State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He expressed the view that the Country Party might outvote the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is why thinking people within the Liberal Party are joining the call for one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland, the State Government is a coalition which is controlled by a party which received the minority <span class="highlight">vote</span>, namely, the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the 1972 State election the Country Party received 20 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span> cast in Queensland and won 26 seats; the Liberal Party received just over 22 per cent, which was about 2 per cent more than the Country Party received, and won 21 seats, which was 5 seats fewer; and the Australian Labor Party gained 48 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span> and won 33 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the worst gerrymander ever, the Government of Queensland was elected on 42i per cent of the State <span class="highlight">vote</span>, with 47 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party candidates received approximately  5i  per cent more of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span> than the combined Country Party and Liberal Party received, but it won 14 seats fewer than the Government parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland it took an average of 13,045 votes to elect an ALP candidate and 6,972 to elect a Country Party candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can foresee, as  Mr Martin,  the  President  of the Young Liberals in Queensland, apparently had the foresight to realise, that if the Liberal Party wishes to sit idly by and allow the Country Party voting power to develop to such a degree that one <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the country is worth 1 or 2 votes in the city there certainly will be a reaction from people living in the cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat what I said earlier: Although all the people in the cities did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for me, I will be standing up as I am today, demanding the rights of the people who live in the cities and demanding that the value of their <span class="highlight">vote</span> be the same as that of people living in country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value’ was the honourable gentleman’s indulgence the other evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> of one person, whatever his occupation or location, should be as good as the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable gentleman wants to keep the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, about the only place in which he could display that principle would be in a political clinic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I have heard no complaint from the Minister nor have I heard any suggestion from the Minister for Education that they are determined to bring the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value ink Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Tonkin Government wants to show that it has a conviction about one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value let it persist in the matter but there has been precious little evidence of any persistence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not heard the Minister announce: T propose to lead an expedition to South Australia to relieve the people from their state of torment about the fact that they have not one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are 10 senators from South Australia representing 350,000 people with votes of the same value as 10 senators from New South Wales who represent 31 million people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The crux of the Bill is concerned with a matter which is at the heart of the democratic parliamentary process, namely, that as far as possible the value of a man’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> should be the same wherever he lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have talked about everything else but this; and the Bill is concerned with one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principle which is embodied in this Bill is one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It stated that constituencies should be made up of an equal number of voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has already been stated in this House by the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly),  the answer for the member in the farflung electorate is not to pervert the electoral system whereby the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of a person living in the Wimmera electorate has much more value than the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of a person living in my electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been consistent adherence to a principle which we on the Government side hold to be inviolate in the total democratic process - that is, one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is whether to support the democratic principle that is embodied in the Bill - one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value - or whether to continue to support the manipulations that exist in the present Electoral Act whereby one group in the community continues to be over-represented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us who sit on the Government side of the House - included in our ranks are more representatives of country electorates than any other political party has - say categorically that the value of all men’s votes should be equal, irrespective of where they live or what they do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I intend to devote my time to focusing the debate on 4 central questions: Firstly, does this legislation achieve the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, is it possible to achieve one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value as a principle in a practical sense? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, of course, is part of the one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value philosphy and calls into question the Commonwealth Electoral Act of 1902 which at that time prescribed the tolerance of 20 per cent above or below the quota for each electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me deal with the first question 1 posed - that is, does this Bill achieve one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever tol erance is measured in the terms of this Bill, there are powerful constitutional reasons why the one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value concept just does not apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So where is this one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value concept? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government really wants one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value why does not it have a referendum to ask the people to reduce the number of electorates in Tasmania so that the number of electors in each electorate in Tasmania will equal those of the mainland States? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation alters the degree of tolerance from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, but it does not achieve one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear the same old interpretations that the Commonwealth Electoral Act favours the Country Party and violates the sacred principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the 20 per cent tolerance provided under the present Act - indeed since federation - violates a principle, then surely no-one will say that a 10 per cent tolerance does not violate the same principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this was in the guise of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill is a smokescreen fired by the catchcry - the emotional catchcry - of the elusive principle of ‘one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While ever Tasmania is in its privileged position vis-a-vis New South Wales, while ever the population does not remain static, there is no point in debating the issue of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">vote</span> one value would be to have a national redistribution of electoral boundaries a day after the census is taken and have an election held the next day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So let us dispose once and for all of this nonsense and humbug that this Bill sets out to achieve one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to the second question which I posed, namely: Is it possible to achieve the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither does it achieve one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value as a principle, nor does it offer a practical workable proposal to Distribution Commissioners in a time when population mobility can cause enormous fluctuations from place to place in 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Country Party pooh-poohs the proposition of one man one <span class="highlight">vote</span> and believes that this is certainly not the sort of thing that one should support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  speaking on this Bill last Thursday evening, in regard to one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that the Leader of the Opposition, when speaking undoubtedly for the Liberal Party alone and not for the Country Party, put up a reasonable argument that he is in favour of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value and that this Parliament should legislate to achieve this end as nearly as practicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our purpose is to maintain, as far as is practicable and fair, the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though the electoral commissioners will distribute electorates on the basis of actual electors 1 hope they will also look at the matter from the point of view of the total population, realising that we represent not only people who will have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the next election but also people who do nol have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> either because they are too young or because they are not yet naturalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Gwydir also made the point that the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value does not exist anymore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principle of 100 per cent one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value could not operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if there were proportional representation for an entire State or for the Commonwealth, we would have one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not surprised that he supports this principle because he was elected to this House from a country seat with 16.6 per cent of the primary <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With just over 8,000 primary votes, he represents the people of McMillan - nearly 50,000 electors - in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Considering the views of the honourable member I am not surprised that he received only 8,000 odd votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The views that he expressed in his maiden speech were the views of the League of Rights and it is surprising and deplorable to me that people with views such as those should receive even 8,000 votes in any electorate in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I was pleased that even in an electorate such as McMillan he was able to receive only 16 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The insidious changes that are proposed are being introduced under a very attractive slogan - one man, one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present Bill, besides bringing about a redistribution of seats following the 1971 census - a move which the previous Government dodged - is a further step towards the Labor Party goal of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a member for one of the larger electorates, I can fully appreciate the difficulties of distance in these large electorates and the amount of travel involved in endeavouring to give some service to the people, but I feel that this situation does not justify the large disparity in numbers that exists at present, lt should not be used to reduce the value of electors’ votes in other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But whilst we still have our anomalies in South Australia, I think we have lost our crown as the most gerrymandered State to Queensland, where we see the reins of government in the hands of a Party which is receiving only 20 per cent of the overall votes of the Queensland people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the House firmly believe that one man’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> is as good as anothers, and we will continue to press for reforms in the electoral system of our society so that we can say that our society is democratic in every sense ot the word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To achieve that end, the Minister claimed that his entire approach was predicated on the wish to achieve one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value, although he admitted ‘that a degree of variation must be allowed, that exact equality in the number for division cannot be achieved, nor is it desirable’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>None other than the great Australian Labor Party - the great one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s only interest in one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value is the belief that there is electoral advantage for the Labor Party in such a proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister made a submission to the Commissioners that an extra 4,000 voters should be taken from the seat of Prospect and added to the seat of Reid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The acceptance of this proposal would have been to move further away from the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It emerged that the Prime Minister’s son wanted to stand for pre-selection for Prospect and the 4,000 voters included in the area proposed to be shifted to Reid contained the most left wing members of the ALP who were opposed to having the Prime Minister’s son as a candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it shows the real attitude of the Labor Party to the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value that is, that it should be advanced only when politically expediency demands it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is one other aspect of the one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value concept about which more needs to be said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Right through the Minister’s speech he kept making statements such as ‘we should not accept regional discrimination’, ‘the principle of substantial equality of representation between electoral divisions was almost eliminated’ and ‘every worthwhile authority supports the case for one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value and equality of electorates’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the fact that the Minister has not even mentioned such a difference demonstrates his real lack of sincerity on the question of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister talks about freedom of the individual and the right of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How is a member of Parliament in the Opposition in this place going to achieve one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value in this place? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is doing this now because it is ashamed of what the Bill contains, ashamed to have exposed in debate for another 2 days the provisions of the measure which the Minister has introduced and which he knows is designed to perpetuate Labor rule and to establish a circumstance in which many metropolitan or extra-metropolitan seats would be smaller in terms of the number of voters than some of the large and vast electorates of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the catch cry ‘one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value* the Government is trying to conceal what could become for the first time in the Commonwealth’s history a gerrymander of electoral boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A very thorough assessment of this Bill by the Liberal Party organisation showed that, on the same <span class="highlight">vote</span> that occurred on 2nd December last year, and being most optimistic, that is, optimistic from our point of view, the redistribution we are now discussing would have increased the majority of the Australian Labor Party from 9 to 16. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, the Government is trying to create a situation in which it would not need to get any more votes to win more seats or, perhaps, the Government wants to win the same number of seats with many less votes than it received on 2nd December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At present there is no doubt that, with one exception in the last 25 years or more, the Party which received the majority of votes became the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have only to look at the result of the last election where the Labor Party received 49.7 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and won 53.6 per cent of the electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Government wants to do is so to distribute the electorates that the big majorities in the metropolitan areas are reduced and some of that <span class="highlight">vote</span> is moved out in order to make what was a marginal seat a strong Labor seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No-one disagrees with the slogan of one man one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, but what this really means is that in a democracy the government should be won by the party which obtains a majority of votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But in the rural electorates - for instance, Corangamite or Wimmera - each 3 voters represent only 5 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Factors that allow a party which gains 8 per cent of the votes to enjoy 16 per cent of the parliamentary representation have no place in an Electoral Act that should enshrine the basic democratic principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch)  would rather cloud the issue and allow one electorate to be twice as large as another than speak in defence of the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, the most basic principle of democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Not only must this Parliament be representative by observing equal electorate representation so that urban, country and fringe areas are represented equally, and so that socioeconomic groupings are represented equally, but it must guarantee that as far as practicable one man’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> is equal to the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of any other man, no matter where he lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To be responsible means that the Government must receive the majority of votes cast by the people and a change in electoral support must be reflected by a change of parliamentary support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This sensitivity can be preserved only when the voting system and electoral boundaries express the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have heard from supporters of the Government during the time that this Bill has been debated an attempt to reconcile their slogan of ‘one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value’ with the fact that this Bill provides for a 10 per cent variation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been somewhat amusing for one to sit on this side of the chamber, to listen to supporters of the Government  -  I am looking at one honourable member in particular, but there were many others - and to try to reconcile the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value with the Government’s desire in this Bill to reduce the variation from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Services and Property, when talking about the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, said that ‘on this question’ that is what the Bill provides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One honourable member  -  I think it is the one at whom I am looking at the moment - said something to the effect that this Bill was a big step along the way toward the principle of achieving the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">vote</span> had to be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the last State election in Western Australia the Liberal Party won 29.3 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>, the Australian Country Party won 5 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and with 34.3 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> between them, naturally they lost the election by only one seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can talk all one likes about whether the margin should be  5  per cent,  10  per cent,  20  per cent or whatever one likes, but as nearly as possible - this Bill and this clause point in the right direction - representation should be on the basis of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the United States it was held that every person’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> should as nearly as practicable have the same value and the same weighting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think most people would agree that the first requirement in any election is that the Party or Parties which get the majority of the votes should form the government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Services and Property quoted the results of several elections with the object of showing that although the Australian Labor Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> had exceeded the Liberal-Country Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> on more than one occasion this had not resulted in the formation of an ALP government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What he forgot to quote, of course, was the total percentage of votes from all the non-Labor parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The plain fact is that one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value is merely a catch cry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question was: Should there or should there not be one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In trying to support their very weak arguments they dragged into the debate the Tasmanian situation and asked: ‘Where is the one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value principle in Tasmania on a comparison with the mainland States?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The motion is frivolous in whatever whining and whinging terms it might have been moved and therefore my Government will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I had intended to move an amendment, which I had shown to the Minister, that the Committee, before the commencement of business, elect one of its members to be  Chairman,  but I do not think it is necessary to move the amendment and press it to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> at this point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is wrong in voting as we want to or putting to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> the question that this side of the House has confidence in the AttorneyGeneral and the way in which he has handled things? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just how great that pressure is can be concluded from the fact that there was a tied <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the Australian Labor Party Federal Conference on a motion to abolish ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, if they are opposed to the Bill they should say so and <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They had the opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against that proposal when it came before the Parliament, but they did not do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All I can say, more in sorrow than in anger, is that he should at least be able to sit for a moment or two and listen to the facts in relation to an industry which, of course, he harmed by his <span class="highlight">vote</span> which enabled the imposition of an excise which hurt the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I said the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a metropolitan seat in the lower House there had a value of one; a country seat had a value of 3; and a north west seat had a value of 6. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Curtin suggested that I was misrepresenting the situation when I said that at the last State election in Western Australia the Liberal Party won 29.3 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and the Australian Country Party won 5 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and with 34.3 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> between them they lost the election by only one seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the aggregate of their votes adding up to 34.3 per cent does not invalidate my argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Presumably where there was no Country Party candidate the Country Party voter voted for the Liberal candidate and where there was no Liberal Party candidate the Liberal Party voter voted tor the Country Party candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Dauer-Kelsay index of representativeness points out that a party could win government in Western Australia with 33.1 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the election that took place on that occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact if the Liberal Party left a Labor seat unopposed it would not be calling out on polling day a very large Labor <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a safe Labor seat, and that in fact would be a reinforcement of my argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But quite apart from that particular accidental <span class="highlight">vote</span> of that election, the Dauer-Kelsay index pointed out that one could govern Western Australia on 33.1 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Lower House of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The plot in New South Wales, to which the honourable member offers no objection, is sponsored by the Country Party in its desperation to destroy one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, to keep electorates malapportioned and in every way to perpetuate in this country the most undemocratic processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At this point let me make it perfectly clear that the Bill does not change the situation whereby citizens of the 31 Commonwealth countries, whether they become Australian citizens or not, continue to have the status of British or Commonwealth of Nations subjects and as such have privileges such as the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and eligibility to be appointed to public services under Acts of Parliament not administered by me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was interesting to discover that almost 90 per cent of the readers of that newspaper, which has by far the largest readership of any foreign language publication in Australia, particularly among the Italian community in Australia, said they would <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were many reasons why they should <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Labor Party, one being that it promised to introduce the sort of legislation which is now before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The acceptance of so much of our program by the Liberal Pary and the Country Party confirms this belief and goes to the extent of making it hard for us to remember now all the agonising they appeared to go through on such questions as votes for 18-year-olds, the removal of excise tax on wine, the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Bill or, to come back to the Bill before the House, unqualified portability of pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With the very greatest reluctance, but in view of the importance of the matter now before the House and my desire to push it through to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, I now give the Leader of the House the undertaking that today I withdraw the other motion standing in my name. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1954,  Dr Evatt  who then led the Labor Party at an election made a pledge on this matter without consulting the ALP authorities, for <span class="highlight">vote</span> getting purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This action of the Prime Minister which went against fundamental Labor Party policy and which violated the written platform of his Party was taken quite cynically for <span class="highlight">vote</span> catching purposes and it was effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example, in an amalgamation ballot in which 51 per cent of the membership voted, and 51 per cent of those voting were in favour, the proposal would be carried even though only 26.01 per cent of the total membership voted in favour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a small boy, in company with my late father,  Sir Arthur  Fadden, accompanied by the shire  chairman,  met us, shook me by the hand and said: ‘Young McVeigh, you do not have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> as yet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be a long time before you do but when you have one for heaven’s sake <span class="highlight">vote</span> for Artie’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, prior to my having the <span class="highlight">vote</span> there was a redistribution of electorates and Artie Fadden had the choice of contesting the new seat of McPherson, which included part of his original territory of Darling Downs, or the seat of Darling Downs centred on Toowoomba. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I point out to the House that it is the general practice of this Government to allow motions of this kind under General Business to be taken to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on all occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is one on which members on this side of the Parliament and, I understand, on the other side, are to have a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would hope, subject to the concurrence of the Parliament, that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be taken on the measure on the day it is debated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If there is anybody in this House who is not a parliamentarian he will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the suspension of Standing Orders, but anybody in this House who is committed to the parliamentary system, and to the sense of democracy and the way it has been built up by people over the centuries will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the suspension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would suggest that while the leadership of the Queensland Premier might be acceptable to the less than 20 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> that the Country Party receives in Queensland, from the viewpoint of the workers in that State, they have been led into a situation where they are receiving the lowest wages in Australia, when comparisons are made with the workers of the other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But I point out to the honourable member that under this Government every issue brought forward by private members has been given time not only to be debated but also for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have therefore agreed as a Party that we will not interfere with the rights of members to <span class="highlight">vote</span> as they think fit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government, in charge, of the business of the House, has decided that a given time will be provided for debate and in addition time will be allowed for votes to be taken so that the views of honourable members on this Bill can be determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will be allowing this issue to come to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and we will give honourable members the right to express their opinions and the right to participate in a debate and to reach a decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I list a few of them: The Parliament has not sat beyond 11 p.m. or into the early hours of the morning; adequate time has been given for questions, matters of urgency and adjournment debates; adjournment debates have taken place at a reasonable hour on 3 nights a week and in fact, on some occasions, the time set aside for this purpose has not been availed of by members, and only on one occasion due to deliberate disruption by certain , members of the Opposition, was it not possible to adjourn the House at 10.15 for the adjournment debate as intended; private members’ business has been called upon on all occasions and sometimes extended and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> taken on all occasions; and the Grievance debate has been called upon on all occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is clear that the Government intends to oppose the amendment but we will <span class="highlight">vote</span> on that when the time comes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The opportunity for education is a little like the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> - it may not always be exercised but it must always be available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I presume that at that time there will be an open <span class="highlight">vote</span> for every honourable member to decide whether he wants proceedings to be televised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In spite of this, the major effect of the Bill in respect of amalgamation is to remove the provision which requires that for an amalgamation proposal to be approved 50 per cent of those eligible must <span class="highlight">vote</span> and, of those voting formally, more than half must approve the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the public interest is to be considered, is it not fair to say that before there can be an amalgamation at least 50 per cent of the members should <span class="highlight">vote</span> and that of the 50 per cent of the members who <span class="highlight">vote</span> there must be a majority in favour of the amalgamation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that this power - that is the power to include a bans clause and also the power to be able to ensure its effectiveness - is so vital tha unless we in this chamber are successful in having the clause retained we will have no alternative but to divide and to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Government’s proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The more I hear the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  the more inclined 1 am to think that if the honourable member for Diamond Valley  (Mr McKenzie)  were to make retrospective the legislation which he proposes to introduce tomorrow I might <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Frankly, as an Australian, I resent a British migrant being able to come to this country and, after residing here for only 6 months, having the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the affairs of this nation, just as I believe as an Australian that I should not have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a United Kingdom election after living for only 6 months in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The protests are against clause 50 of the Bill which prohibits future registration of any union rule which would have the effect of depriving the rank and file of that union of a direct <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the election of the members of the union’s management committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do honourable members know that when people want to know what members views are on a Bill or a resolution they do not look up the record and read what has been said; they have a look to see where the member’s name is recorded in the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The simple facts are that I informed the Leader of the House that the Opposition parties regarded this matter as one for a conscience <span class="highlight">vote</span>, therefore speaking in the House would not be subject to party discipline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, we can <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, we can <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, we can <span class="highlight">vote</span> for an amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, in the time available to us probably there is only one choice as regards amendments, namely, to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for that moved by the honourable member for Casey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Bill, basically for 2 reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second reason why I cannot accept or <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Bill is because it deals with only one aspect of the problem; that is, abortion, which I regard as a failure of contraception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would prefer not to have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Bill because if the Bill is defeated it could well mean the sweeping of this problem under the carpet for a long time to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot, by a clever <span class="highlight">vote</span>, simply be swept under the carpet in the House or in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I would rather not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Bill because it would indicate that I had no thoughts about doing something in regard to this problem, and I do wish something done about the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Party has decided, consistent with our attitudes, that every member of it should <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue according to the way he feels morally bound to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> to defeat both amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To defeat that amendment I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> yes as it is necessary to do in order to defeat it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the majority of honourable members votes in the same way as I do, the further amendment which has been circulated in the name of the honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  will not be able to be moved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question which will then be put to the House, if I understand it correctly, is: That this Bill be now read a second time’, and on that question I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> no. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It needs to be understood that I will firstly <span class="highlight">vote</span> yes, and secondly <span class="highlight">vote</span> no. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An additional reason why I would not want by my <span class="highlight">vote</span> to pass this Bill is that I would not want to contribute to a situation in which young men and women may take a decision which could haunt them with guilt for the rest of their lives when a chance event brought back to their recollection the decision which they took many years ago and which deprived them of the opportunity of a child - stifled a life at a time when there were on them great pressures which they could not withstand at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am morally committed to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this Bill and the amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And on a sensitive issue like this, a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Parliament is the way to get it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would be no reform unless there was a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So today we are debating a Bill which would provide for abortion on request, and there is to be a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very infuriating to realise that it  is  men who are largely responsible for the campaign opposing the Medical Practice Clarification Act, and men who will <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He even called on the proabortionists in a Press release last night to harass members who <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just make the point that those who sit opposite represent a minority of the Australian public because they gained less than 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me to be a rather odd position for a government to take, whether it be a Liberal government or a Labor government, that it will send its represenatives to Geneva, will participate in debates, will speak in favour of the ratification of conventions, will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the ratification of conventions, will use its voice and <span class="highlight">vote</span> to tell other people that they ought to ratify and support the principles contained in conventions and then promptly forget all about them and do nothing about the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One good reason for not doing so is that little more than one-half of the people who <span class="highlight">vote</span> on election day are women and women are starting to stand up on their hind legs - if they have hind legs; I do not know what women do - and demand some proper recognition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And incorporating those words in an amendment which was passed, means it’s a very dangerous thing, because if this is followed by the caucus as it should be it means we will have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the wheat stabilisation bill, dairy industry, the various wool commitments, the Australian Wool Commission, all of these are subsidised industries that cannot stand on their feet under this criteria, more dangerously Graham, is, if this criteria is baid to secondary industry which is a tariff, it means the abolition virtually of all secondary industries in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An amendment was moved to a motion which would have involved the exposure of the goings-on of the AttorneyGeneral,  Senator Murphy,  and pairs were granted when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the amendment was taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senators Fitzgerald, Keeffe and Cant voted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last night’s Melbourne ‘Herald’ carried the headline: Government gets Report of Fake <span class="highlight">Vote</span> Plot’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member said that the House should sit longer, but the other day he was one of those who voted against an extension of the sitting times by an hour in the morning and by taking a little time off the dinner break. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very gentleman who said that we should sit longer was one of those who voted with all those who sit opposite against extending by an hour or so a week the sitting time of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every General Business day has taken place, which is contrary to what was done by honourable members opposite when they were in office, and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> has been taken on every General Business day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yesterday the Newcastle ‘Morning Herald’ carried a headline extending over 4 columns, ‘Blackbutt Road Favoured - Bombshell <span class="highlight">Vote</span> in Council’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Newcastle City Council voted to allow the construction of a 6-lane highway through the Blackbutt Reserve - a beautiful reserve of natural bushland occupying more than 400 acres close to the inner area of Newcastle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is important is the way in which the matter was put to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One had to <span class="highlight">vote</span> either yes or no to a Bill, without being given the opportunity of explaining one’s attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liberal voters with liberal leanings have always been able to point to progressive Liberals within the party such as  Mr Peacock  and  Mr Chipp,  but after Thursday’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> they had no one to point to as upholding their banner on their behalf . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These considerations bothered me and that is why I could not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Bill as it was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those telegrams were not directed to asking members not to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Bill; they said: ‘No Bill; demand you <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the amendment’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the amendment is concerned, I think I have indicated why I would not myself <span class="highlight">vote</span> to support it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why I do not propose to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If need be I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it and I assure the House that I will have no difficulty in walking across the chamber to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it, or indeed, getting across by any other means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it, and nothing in years will give me more pleasure than so doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where did he <span class="highlight">vote</span> when the Bill to amend the previous magnificent legislation of the past government - which stood for balanced development of Australia in cooperation with the States - and to set up a Cities Commission was introduced? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to the remarks that have been made, particularly those of the honourable member for Darling Downs, when the Bill comes to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> it will be interesting to see how honourable members will <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue as members of a national Parliament concerned with the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he wants to join our side for the next <span class="highlight">vote</span> - I am not suggesting he should gag the debate - and bring some of the honourable members on his side with him to defeat their viewpoint I believe he will be doing the nation’s long established free enterprise system a good service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Capital Territory was given representation in the Australian Parliament in 1948 on the initiative of the then Labor Government, with effect from the 1949 elections, on the basis that the member representing the Australian Capital Territory had the same voting rights as the member for the Northern Territory at that time, namely, that the member could <span class="highlight">vote</span> only on a motion to disallow an ordinance affecting the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1959 he was given the same additional right as was given in that year to the member for the Northern Territory to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on any Bill that related solely to his Territory, namely, the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1966, after years of advocacy by the former distinguished member, the late Jim Fraser, and the Australian Labor Party, the member for the Australian Capital Territory was given the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on any matter after the ensuing general election for this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly it would be a difficult amendment to carry … Be that as it may, the situation is that as long as this is a bicameral legislature, in the name of democracy and decency people throughout the nation should have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for both chambers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course it might have been the Victorian election, which indicated that the Australian Country Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Wimmera, for example, was halved and that there was an increase in the Australian Labor Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Dundas, Portland and Kara Kara. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, the rural <span class="highlight">vote</span> for Labor in Victoria was up, so this perhaps is a signal that something should have been done by the present Opposition when it was in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason that this matter of definite public importance has been raised today is that in the Victorian electorate of Dundas the Australian Labor Party first preference <span class="highlight">vote</span> increased in the recent Victorian election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in this election the Country Party withdrew those preferences from the Labor Party and witnessed the spectacle of its total <span class="highlight">vote</span> being reduced considerably. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The facts are that in the rural areas of Victoria, the Australian Labor Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> increased last Saturday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> for Labor in Dundas, Portland and Kara Kara was higher than for the previous State election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However I hope that we are not just getting on the band wagon of being fashionable and saying that because people can draw up a will at 18 years of age or can <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the age of 18 they are capable of doing everything at 18 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last month it was agreed by the Steering Committee of the Convention that 21 local government delegates, sharing 8 votes, would be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This fulfils our promise to give local government a voice and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They may disagree violently with some points of policy outlined in a policy speech or mentioned in the election campaign and yet, because of other major items which appeal to them or because of something they dislike in the policy of the other party, they <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of that particular party and return it to power even though they disagree with items in the policy speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as I can see, the reason for this administrative monstrosity seems to be purely to redeem a rash but <span class="highlight">vote</span> catching electoral promise by the Prime Minister to allow local government direct access to Commonwealth funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I negotiated with the honourable member for Mackellar and I said that the Government would agree to hearing his second reading speech and the speech of the seconder, who in this case was the honourable member for Sturt  (Mr Wilson),  after which I would reply and that we would be doing everything possible to get a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely a member who initiated a private members Bill - and the same position should apply if the legislation was initiated by the Opposition - would desire a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be taken on his proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After that, in keeping with our declared obligation to give private members the opportunity to bring down Bills, we felt that we should proceed to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have assumed that any private member bringing down a Bill would have the desire to see it go to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>can understand that because it has not been the nature of this Parliament for many years for the Government to permit any private member’s Bill to be debated, let alone to bring it right to the culmination point of a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We want to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He came to me and asked what would be done about the Bill and  1  said that in accordance with Government practice we intended to give private members, even him, the opportunity to put things forward in this place, to have them debated and also to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was mentioned that he would be moving the motion - naturally his seconder would have to support it - and we would reply to the debate and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> would be taken after that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Standing Orders, what would have happened, is that the major time would have been taken up on that resolution and it would have been possible for me to have introduced this Bill and made it available for circulation and study by honourable members so that we could have an informed <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was designed for the very good reason that when a Bill is introduced honourable members should have a chance of reading it and studying it before they are called upon to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members who have not read it - they received it only a few minutes ago - are being asked and commanded to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it and kill it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We arranged with him that the mover and the seconder would speak, we would be given an opportunity to reply and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> would be taken today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was my Party which in 1959 widened the voting power of the member for the Territory and in 1966 introduced legislation which ensured that he had the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on any matter coming before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One feature of this Bill, as I said, is that while Territory senators are to be counted for forming a quorum and while they have a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, so that they are in this sense full senators, they are still to have a term which coincides not with that of other senators - 6 years  - but a term which coincides with that of members of the lower House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Questions arising in the Senate shall be determined by a majority of votes, and each senator shall have one <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it does, and they  aTe  senators, they can <span class="highlight">vote</span> and be counted in the majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But unfortunately, if they are senators, if they can <span class="highlight">vote</span> and can be part of a quorum, you cannot by excluding them from the machinery make nonsense of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They <span class="highlight">vote</span> on party lines because since 1900 the party system of government, for good or bad - generally I take the view that it is for good - has come to fruition, although probably its best days are yet to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate, particularly in recent months, votes as does this House - along Party lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tonight we are talking about representation of a population half as large as that of Tasmania, which has long been carried by one member for the ACT, a member for many years denied full representation rights and the opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on issues affecting the Commonwealth of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government members were able to force through the Council only a week or so ago a move to freeze the transfer of land from leasehold to freehold despite the fact that every elected member but one voted against the proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a very restrictive and carefully drawn section of the Constitution and I think it makes it clear that this Parliament is constitutionally incapable of conferring on the people represented in the Senate - whether they represent the Northern Territory or the Australian Capital Territory in the Senate - the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Senate or, indeed, to be senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But you cannot <span class="highlight">vote</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that any law which endeavours to confer on people chosen from the Territories to sit in the Senate the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Senate would be an unconstitutional law and would be thrown out by the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only people in the States can <span class="highlight">vote</span> for senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, if the proposed new senators are not senators, they cannot <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value is thrown right out of the window. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will not say it to me because I will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Bill, but perhaps it will be said to some supporters of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not easy to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the measure and no one voted against it but it was utterly unprincipled that throughout the time when  Mr Jock  Nelson was a member of this House there was a steel determination on the part of the then Government not to confer voting rights on him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should have remained throughout that term without a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and then should have gone to election when we would have had a member elected who had voting rights, that matter being determined by the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other serious misrepresentation by the honourable member for Mackellar was in making the disparities between the States on the question of one man one <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When normally one objects to departures in principle from one man one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one objects to deliberate malapportionment which is intended to favour a party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not anything other than a compact which all the Australian people voted for when the Federation was originally formed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, but when the principle of one man one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value is departed from it causes damage and a lack of faith in the body politic, not if it is done to equalise the States but if it is done to ensure that the Australian people do not get the government for which they voted; when it is an arrangement to ensure that a minority can stay in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I recollect, the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  had a reasonably handsome majority in a small electorate, but reproduce that as a Senate <span class="highlight">vote</span> if  2  senators were standing and the result would probably be a split one and one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the present member for the Australian Capital Territory  (Mr Enderby)  enjoyed a handsome majority, if the votes of a whole lot of minor parties were added together and regarded as a non-Labor Senate <span class="highlight">vote</span> it would probably have returned a nonLabor senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the conferring of the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this House on the member of the Northern Territory when it was done in mid-term and not as a condition of the election in which he was originally elected was one of the most disgraceful episodes in the electoral history of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He believes 100 per cent in Senate representation for the Northern Territory so long as he does not have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has never voted for anything worth while for the Northern Territory since he has been here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if, for example, with the new suburbs of Tuggeranong in the south it is seen by the commissioners on the trends of population that there will be a very large increase in the southern division, making it very much larger than the other division in two or three years time, they will require a tolerance when they fix the 2 divisions so that with the passage of time the position will be brought closer to one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that in the United States of America, where it was held that the constitution required one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, it has been conceded that 10 per cent is not necessarily enough to achieve it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The commissioners may need more than 10 per cent to achieve one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value at the time of an election, depending on the capacity of growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the most important thing is that this Parliament must ensure that every person who is entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> has the opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and it must also ensure that no person who is not entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> should ever cast a ballot in an electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  is seized with the importance and the urgency to upgrade the responsibilities and the remuneration of these officers and also to ensure that proper steps are taken to make it possible for every person who is entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, apart from that is the consideration that every person who has a responsibility to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the election of this Parliament should exercise it consistent with the laws of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicate that it is Opposition policy not to oppose the Bill by a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this House because this is a Government which is digging itself deeper into the economic mire; and if that is its policy it will need to bear the full responsibility of those programs in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It should have been voted on on non-party lines if there was any good faith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was killed by a Caucus <span class="highlight">vote</span> which had been predetermined by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet the Government says ‘At least we are allowing a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on your private member’s Bill’ when all it has done - even the Minister at the table obviously had not read it - is decide to kill it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only 2 years ago the left wing failed by one <span class="highlight">vote</span> to have the security organisation dismantled in terms of the Australian Labor Party’s policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, reluctantly, the Opposition must <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the whole Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore we have no option today but to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this Bill in its entirety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against Income Tax Assessment Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that electorate the servicemen’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> is quite considerable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a <span class="highlight">vote</span> catching device. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons for that was that servicemen in those electorates instinctively knew that a Labor Party government could not be trusted with defence; that, whatever the Labor Party might do about providing marginal benefits of this sort as a <span class="highlight">vote</span> winning device, when it came to establishing priorities defence would be very low down on the list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why they did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Labor Party, and everything that has happened since this Government came into office makes it quite clear that servicemen showed very good judgment in this respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless that attitude is adopted the public will be asked to subsidise owners of small industries - perhaps uneconomic industries - who obviously <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The principle of ‘one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value’ must be established as the fundamental objective of redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Darling Downs  (Mr McVeigh)  who interjected received 17 per cent of the primary votes at the last election and he got into the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Factors such as ‘the area of the division’, ‘the density or sparsity of population’ and references to ‘disabilities arising out of remoteness or distance’ inserted by the previous Government in 1965, are contrary to the concept of equality of political rights and encourage departure from the quota of electors in a manner which makes the value of a citizen’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> depend largely upon his geographical location. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The changes proposed by this Bill are designed to provide by legislative measures that, as far as may be practicable, the value of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of one citizen shall be equivalent to the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of another and to give some meaningful application to the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value’ without unnecessarily restricting the Distribution Commissioners in proposing a redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also worth recording that in rejecting the Bill, the Senate did not advance any new arguments, their opposition being a blatant political move designed to maintain loaded electorates and destroy the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a challenge to those who sit opposite to stand up and be counted on the fundamental democratic principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value and majority rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the House of how overwhelming was the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in that referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the total <span class="highlight">vote</span> for yes in Australia overall was 89 per cent and in Victoria it was 93 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should mention, in this regard that during the autumn sittings problem) were experienced occasionally when the Government sought to ensure that the House had the opportunity to bring general business matters to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some honourable members felt, rightly or wrongly, that they were being forced to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on matters that they had not had adequate time to consider. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To avoid these problems in these sittings I suggest to the House that it would be more suitable if when the normal time for general business expires and it is not practicable to take a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the matter before the House the debate be adjourned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a later stage, if it is so wished, the House could arrange a special Friday sitting devoted entirely to dealing with outstanding business debates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest that today, when honourable members opposite are considering what attitude they will adopt to these proposals, they give due consideration to public opinion on this issue and not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the extension of the sitting hours of this Parliament to which is needed to enable it to put through legislation which is vitally important and which the people are entitled to have fully discussed in reasonable hours, at reasonable times and with proper and adequate consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite honourable members to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this motion, and to go back to their electorates and tell the people that they do not want to be in Parliament because they want to be back in their electorates looking after the cows, if they are in the Country Party, and God knows who, if they are in the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That in matters of procedure the  Chairman  or  Deputy Chairman  presiding at the meeting have a deliberative <span class="highlight">vote</span> and, in the event of an equality of voting, have a casting <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and that, in other matters, the  Chairman  or  Deputy Chairman  have a deliberative <span class="highlight">vote</span> only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope the House can move quickly to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this question so that we can proceed with the business of resolving the location of the new and permanent parliament house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, today, I hope that this House will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the motion and that we will take up the question in a thoroughgoing way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report found in favour of the Camp Hill site and when the matter was debated that site was confirmed by this House in a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of 53 to 49. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This <span class="highlight">vote</span> was not supported by the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be very nice to hope that we could take a <span class="highlight">vote</span> today to facilitate that bringing together of the 2 Houses of Parliament, because what we are dealing with represents a crisis in the history of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make a strong appeal to the House to bring this matter to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House should determine that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> be taken on the question today and not let the debate spill over to another time when, with the greatest of respect, we will be back on the merry-go-round and honourable members will be debating the merits or non-merits of particular sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I strongly urge members of the House of Representatives today to demand that this matter come to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I demand that this matter should come to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> today so that there should be no further spill-off where in this House we are considering sites, which at the moment is a premature action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Burke  (Mr Keith Johnson)  finished by urging in quite strong language that this matter should come to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to that, it is in the hands of the Government whether it comes to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> today and he may argue with his colleagues in the Government on the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government does not bring it to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> today I think that the Government is quite right because there are a number of people in this Parliament who want to express their views on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The motion calls for this House to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of a joint sitting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendment calls for this House to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of a joint sitting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives this House an opportunity to do 2 things: First, to express its own opinion as to where the parliament house should be sited - I support the Camp Hill site, but that is a matter for each individual to decide - and at the same time it calls for the House to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a joint sitting for the matter to be discussed by both Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge that when a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken on this matter - that is a matter for the Government - the House should support the amendment because the arguments put forward by the previous speaker do not stand up to any intelligent analysis at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There cannot be any delay as a result of voting for the amendment rather than voting for the motion and, for the reasons I have given, I hope the House will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Council noted the agreement between the Governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea that resolutions in the House of Assembly on important constitutional issues will be by a recorded <span class="highlight">vote</span> and by a substantial majority representative of the nation as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also superfluous because the present Commonwealth Electoral Act has effectively ensured practical adherence to the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, and in so doing has produced electoral justice as judged by that criterion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  in introducing the Bill, spoke more volubly than sincerely of the necessity to establish the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the Government, the amendments proposed by this Bill will mysteriously ensure that all votes will have equal value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat what I said when this Bill was introduced initially: The Liberal Party supports the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so we recognise that the efficacy of policies relating to voter distribution can be measured by the degree to which the size of electorates  tends  toward this ideal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By continually repeating the slogan ‘one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value’ the Labor Party is attempting to confuse the public and to portray itself falsely in the role of a champion of electoral justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned before that one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value is a principle to which we can all subscribe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So therefore it is necessary to have a tolerance factor that is large enough to take account of this situation and which at the same time enables the equality of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We observe the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value more effectively than the countries I have just mentioned to this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only exception was in  1954,  when the Australian Labor Party and the parties supporting it secured some  51  per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> but failed to achieve government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We certainly did not hear such a proposition from the Labor Party before 1966, the year that the number of voters in the Australian Capital Territory first equalled the average number in other electoral divisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, for the benefit of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is not a grossly misleading smokescreen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was pleased to read that he said that and I hope that when he speaks in this Parliament tonight he will support the concept of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  has fixed his attitude on the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value and nobody in the Opposition dares to quibble with that principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now we seek to introduce the principle of basic integrity, that every citizen’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> should be counted equally - the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present situation is equivalent to denying some citizens the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> because virtually their <span class="highlight">vote</span> is meaningless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The use of personal information gained in the census, processed by modern computers without the legislative protection of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value could lead to a most undemocratic situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope the honourable member means that and is prepared, at the appropriate time, to stand up and say that he does not believe in one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the Leader of the Country Party that nothing is surer than when a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken in this Parliament tonight a majority of members will stand on the side of true democracy - will stand for equality of rights for all Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The heart of the matter we are considering is the democratic right of all Australian voters to enjoy equality of representation in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is easy to chant the slogan ‘one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They parrot the phrase ‘one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What I am concerned about, and what we all should be concerned about, is not the value of votes but the value of representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a country such as Australia an electoral system based on the concept of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value theoretically will achieve a strict mechanical or arithmetical quality of voting power at the exact time of a redistribution, but distortions will begin to appear as soon as the boundaries are drawn and there will be increases as population patterns change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make this appeal to the Opposition: Put aside prejudices and petty party political considerations and <span class="highlight">vote</span> this time in conformity with the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the Australian people and hold out a welcoming hand to the people who are here now and those who will come, without wishing them ill or wishing them hurt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of statements made in the House by himself and his colleagues that in recent years too little defence expenditure was on hardware, has he examined in what way he will increase the percentage of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> for hardware. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-73-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that it brought him no comfort to know that we now have 48 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Sydney and Melbourne, not out in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We need to see greater involvement of the backbencher but opportunities under the Standing Orders open to backbenchers are usually times for individual speechmaking - no replies, no motion and no <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Now more than ever if committees are going to be allowed to meet while the House is in session - and it has been suggested that this is possibly one of the recommendations this committee will make - then members of committees will be more ignorant than ever of what is actually going on in the House and of the way to <span class="highlight">vote</span> when they return to the House, if they do return. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In an edition that was made available to me is reference to the size of the new party - this will be the party when the Country Party and the DLP amalgamate - and it appears that if the percentage of votes is considered in Queensland it will have 30.4 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Liberal Party’s 25.4 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Doug Anthony as leader of the new Party would have increased influence over the Liberals because the new Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> (i.e. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That cost will be met from within the allocation made for expenditure on Service works proposals within the total Defence <span class="highlight">Vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government will be happy to take a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this Bill today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, however, the Opposition does not wish to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> taken on this Bill today, I can assure honourable members that the opportunity will be given them to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it in no more than a month’s time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">vote</span> had to be taken on the amendment before the then Government could secure its Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly there was on that occasion a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the question of the abolition of the death penalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment seeking the abolition of the death penalty was defeated in a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on party lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would think that it has been quite improper for our predecessors in the last 2 parliaments to avoid a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on a Bill which the Senate has passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is one thing for this House to <span class="highlight">vote</span> the money; it is quite another whether this Government has the administrative control to spend this money wisely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I take this opportunity to tell honourable members opposite that this Party believes in one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let me state for the nation to hear: Ere this Parliament is out there will be a redistribution of electoral boundaries throughout the length and breadth of Australia and it will be a case of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That legislation will be introduced in order to give effect to equality of voting because, this Government stands against the loading of electorates which allows people like those in possum paddock, if I might use the expression with 50 per cent fewer electors that I have in my electorate, to receive the same <span class="highlight">vote</span> as people who represent a majority of the votes in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Members of the Liberal Party say they believe in one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, but those who sit beside them say they do not believe in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe in the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why would not the Country Party want some loaded system of voting when under such a system it gets only 9 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Australian people but exercises 20 per cent of the control of the Parliament when in government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From memory, not one member of the Country Party has ever won more than 50 per cent of the primary votes before being elected to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Leader of House  (Mr Daly)  who, by self-confession, has said that his time is limited, has once again tried to suggest to honourable members that their seats can be held on 17 per cent or 21 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I might instruct the Leader of the House, who is meant to be in charge of these matters, the whole idea is that under the preferential voting system nobody is elected until he has gained 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under that system people would be elected left, right and centre without receiving 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>, so let us not be carried away with this nonsense that he goes on with every time there is a crowd in the gallery during school holidays. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw the attention of the House to the fact that in the United States of America there is an inbuilt safeguard in that the  President  nominates the Supreme Court judges and the States’ House - the Senate - must confirm the appointments in a majority <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But it concerns me that the Leader of the House, I believe, has thrown discredit on the Government because something like 50 per cent of the members of the Australian Labor Party in the last election received, as I understand it, something less than 50 per cent of the primary votes cast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In introducing this Bill I remind all honourable members that it is completely identical in all respects with the measure which was introduced by me in this chamber on 10 May 1973 and which was carried in this House by <span class="highlight">vote</span> on decision without amendment on 17 May 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was introduced into the Senate on 22 May 1973 and its consideration was there adjourned, by <span class="highlight">vote</span> on division of the Senate, until after the first day of sitting of the Senate after 1 August 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Price control is merely the deception to get a favourable <span class="highlight">vote</span> to transfer power to Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In recreation, the decision to provide community and school centres in co-operation with State governments, the increased <span class="highlight">vote</span> to the National Fitness Council and the allocation of funds for national park development is equally desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1944, the Curtin Labor Government put to the Australian people a referendum seeking Federal powers to control prices, and it was the Liberal Party attitude on that occasion to campaign for a ‘No’ <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I  do  so because from the first time the Federal Labor Leader announced Labor’s policy to introduce a national health scheme - for which subsequently the people of Australia by their <span class="highlight">vote</span> gave a mandate - the Australian Medical Association, individual doctors, representatives of hospital benefit funds and the Press have launched a campaign to vilify and abuse the scheme for the express purpose of creating an area of confusion amongst the Australian people as to the true purpose of our health scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of soaring inflation which is now gripping the economy, is not such a decision to spend more public funds on <span class="highlight">vote</span> catching schemes sheer irresponsibility? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as surely ar the high unemployment level of a year ago was the result of their stop-go Budget of 1971-72, so this flationary boom was largely caused by an irresponsible, <span class="highlight">vote</span> designed, expansionary Budget of 1972-73. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They failed to catch votes but they did bring hardship down on those on low and fixed incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems rather strange that on 2 occasions it should have been rejected until one realises that one can either take a party line or exercise a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on such a matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was disturbed in May when officers of the National Right to Life Association went behind the backs of many hundreds of their members who were urging me by letter and telegram to record my <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Medical Practices Clarification Bill, and suggested instead that I should absent myself from the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In speaking to the private members Bill in May, the Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  expressed very well a view which was widely held by many members on both sides of the House, although a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> was allowed on that Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The House so far has decided that the original proposition is not acceptable, a majority of members having voted for the alternative proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall probably <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the House should move now towards taking a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether honourable members <span class="highlight">vote</span> for or against the amendment is a matter for their own consciences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would prefer - this is why I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> this way– <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of all the questions we put to our members the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the retention of capital punishment for some crimes was by far the most convincing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>States voted overwhelmingly against the abolition of capital punishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All States voted convincingly for the retention of the death penalty in all 4 cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Victoria recorded a slightly lower percentage <span class="highlight">vote</span> than all other States in respect of murder by destruction of aircraft, this being 89 per cent as against the national average of 92 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>In Queensland a somewhat lower percentage was recorded in respect of murder of policemen or warders as 86 per cent voted in favour of the retention of capital punishment for such crimes as against the average of 90 per cent overall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On this side of the House we <span class="highlight">vote</span> as a matter of conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that the Bill will be passed because the abolition of the death penalty is the policy of the Government and a number of members of the Opposition will <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Government on this issue because we on this side of the chamber have a conscience <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that the State has the right to take a life in any circumstances and for that very reason I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the abolition of capital punishment and will oppose all the foreshadowed amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand and respect the feelings of those who cannot <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this Bill, but I cannot agree with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate the sincerity of his point of view but he made the point, as did an honourable member on this side a moment ago, that we are to have a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position with the Labor Party is that its supporters have very few chances for a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am proud to be a member of the Liberal Party and the position in my Party - and I believe in the Country Party - is that I can claim the right to a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on every issue that comes before this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was saying that I always have the right to a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> but in this chamber we do not really get a true reflection of how members feel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am more and more concerned as the weeks go by when reading reports of what happens in the back rooms of the Labor Party where moves are made to control the use of the free <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this respect I will mention what the honourable member for La Trobe had to say because bit by bit, in my view, Parliament is becoming irrelevant as supporters of the Government completely lose the right to a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not mind the interjections but I thought we were to arrive at a consensus by a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this matter and that we were not to be influenced by what the people in Caucus had to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realise that we are committed to hurrying through this debate and I will not delay the <span class="highlight">vote</span> very much longer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have found it a most difficult debate in which to <span class="highlight">vote</span> because whilst emotionally I agree with many of the arguments put forward by the honourable member for New England  (Mr Sinclair),  intellectually I am not persuaded to <span class="highlight">vote</span> with him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the time I conclude by saying that whilst I have voted for the abolition of the death penalty I would pur very strongly that the people who administer the judicial processes of this country should look extremely closely at the method of imprisonment and also at the proposition that certain people for whom the death penalty would apply obviously should have their paper marked very clearly ‘Never to be released’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that one of the more touching scenes in Adelaide was the annual pilgrimage to the family cherry orchard where tea and sympathy were copiously distributed amongst pensioners toy his father, but there was never a <span class="highlight">vote</span> by him in support of amendments moved here in support of pension increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The confusion was vastly intensified by the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Parliamentary Labor Party on Wednesday, against the advice of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, to hold down interest rates on housing loans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will realise the full impact of this and <span class="highlight">vote</span> accordingly the next time the election comes around. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Postmaster-General let the cat out of the mailbag when he told me in answer to a question recently that rural newspapers should pay the same as the general public, otherwise the public would be asked to subsidise owners of small industries who obviously <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the country party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will <span class="highlight">vote</span> unanimously to use the taxpayers’ money for their own selfish purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is significant that the Opposition is opposed not only to the referendum seeking to grant that power but also to the measure which will allow the Australian people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this important question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turning now to the prices referendum Bill itself, these are the reasons why I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For all these reasons, I can assure honourable members that I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have no doubt that an occasion will be provided to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the recommendation of the report and I withhold my judgment until that takes place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister agree with  Major Peter  Young, a member of the Australian Labor Party Federal Executive Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, who yesterday referred trenchantly to the Government’s slashing of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I did, and I concede this and df there is to be any criticism on this point I must accept it, was to extend an invitation to the honourable gentleman to move a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence in myself or the Government on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We had to wait until the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken to see what was the real intention of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr GRASSBY (Riverina - Minister for Immigration) &lt;3.1) - I have given the facts; I have given the assurances; I have given all the information that the Committee needs to make up its mind and on that basis I move that we <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Supreme Court held in 1947, by a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of 6 to 2, that the United States and not California had paramount rights in the territorial sea and, incident to this, full dominion over the resources of the appurtenant seabed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The facts of the matter are that the previous Liberal governments were prepared to introduce a mining code which was called a Minerals (Submerged Lands) Bill, to <span class="highlight">vote</span> upon it and to have it put through this House and through the Senate; but because of interstate rivalry and pressures within the Liberal and Country parties the matter never came to a head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against them tonight in the House and I sincerely hope that the Opposition comes to its senses, that the Bill is carried through the Senate and once and for all the Australian Parliament can assert and exercise sovereignty over the offshore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me say at the outset that I consider it regrettable that in those days, as now, the citizens of the Northern Territory had no right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in such a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said strongly then and I say again today, citizens of the Northern Territory should have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in such a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to note, however, that when the second reading of the Bill was agreed to by this House on 29 May 1973, it was carried by 78 votes to 43. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Seventeen members of the Australian Country Party crossed the floor and voted with the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The result of that division as recorded on page 2815 of Hansard shows that the other 3 members of the Country Party were absent when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet, when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the second reading of the Bill was taken in another place, we find that all 5 Country Party senators voted against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless that attitude is adopted the public will be asked to subsidise owners of small industries - perhaps uneconomic industries - who obviously <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Knowing that he is one of the few democrats in the Liberal Party I hope he will <span class="highlight">vote</span> with us on this motion because his electorate contains, amongst other things, a lot of people with savings - plenty of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That will allow about 2 hours debate for this House to decide whether or not the people of Australia should have the opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the most far reaching powers they have ever been asked to give and for powers which the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  perpetually did not want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it because they realise that the incomes which are not subject to regulation today are the non-wage and non-salary incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am informed that before the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken the Minister spoke to  Mr Reihr,  the Commonwealth Director-General of the Department of Works and  Deputy Chairman  of the Snowy Mountains Council and also to  Mr Douglas,  the chief operations engineer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the intervention by the Minister, despite the discussions that the Minister held, the Snowy Mountains Council by a majority <span class="highlight">vote</span> voted to provide the normal supply of power to New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the telephone <span class="highlight">vote</span> on Sunday afternoon the normal procedure would have been to give  Mr Douglas  orders to continue operations and he would have given orders down the line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Governments could fall on that casting <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having been a Minister in charge of 3 different portfolios I doubt whether there is a Department of State that does not somewhere or other pad expenditure votes in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is bad parliamentary practice, it is bad for departments, it is bad for the Public Service and it ought not to be possible to pad votes in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The expenditure <span class="highlight">vote</span> that can most easily be padded is the <span class="highlight">vote</span> for travelling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is just showing in a slightly ludicrous fashion how particular votes can be padded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest to the Committee that the people of Australia, probably voting the way they did not mean to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, in many instances voted against, as they thought- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Issues raised by private members have been brought to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Boothby is one of the members who voted against sitting an extra hour a day and now he wants to sit for the whole of the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Boothby voted against the extension of the sitting hours by one or two hours a day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also voted against allowing a minute extra to honourable members to enable them to get to the chamber in time when a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is being taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We now know that the Snowy Mountains Council voted  -  I am fairly reliably informed that it was a 5 to 2 <span class="highlight">vote</span> - in favour of continuing to operate the Snowy scheme in the way that it was being operated under normal procedures and that something intervened after the Council had voted in that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the House, when he debated the subject on the last occasion, poohpoohed that idea and said: ‘Whoever thinks that senators <span class="highlight">vote</span> on State lines any more?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this side of the House the situation is quite different and, as the Government should have reason to remember, senators on the other side of Kings Hall sometimes exercise their minds on matters of policy and <span class="highlight">vote</span> according to the State interests they represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the Leader of the (House that he has suffered several rebuffs during the course of this Parliament which would indicate that senators have, in fact, voted according to their State interests if they were important enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would be laughed out of any serious discussion if one tried to prove that the Senate votes on State lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not very long ago - within the last 3 years - that a State of Australia directed its senators to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a certain way on a certain question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The senators representing that State, when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken in the Senate, split on Party lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Liberal Party could get them all I find it hard to understand why the leading spokesman for that Party said that although, with 2 senators being elected at one time on a proportional representation basis, his Party would require only 33 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> plus one to get a senator elected, the Australian Labor Party would get the 2 senators for the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will be interesting to see whether he will still stick to the position which he held before when the Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  sat beside me on this bench and voted for this legislation or whether he now accepts the argument which is being put forward by the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  and which was put forward in the Senate by a number of senators, that people who live in the Northern Territory are not Australians and are not entitled to be fully represented in the Australian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that penguins would be as good members of Parliament as some honourable members on the other side of the chamber, but there is no provision in our Constitution for penguins to be given the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He endeavoured to predict the way in which I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> if the debate on this legislation comes to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the Australian Labor Party’s great catch-cries is ‘one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Northern Territory were to be represented by 2 senators it would mean that it would have 3 representatives in the Australian Parliament for that number of voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would ask the Government, while it is being so solicitous about the people of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, to give those people the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I stated which way I would <span class="highlight">vote</span> last time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Page 2815 of Hansard shows that I voted for the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister once said that I, the honourable member for the Northern Territory, believed in 100 per cent Senate representation for the Northern Territory as long as I did not have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, that very afternoon I voted on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made it up as he also made up the business of how I was to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister then said: ‘He has never voted for anything worthwhile for the Northern Territory’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one goes to the Northern Territory and sees what has happened there in the last 6 years one will see that the honourable member for the Northern Territory did <span class="highlight">vote</span> on something worthwhile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a later date the Minister came into the House and, off the cuff in great humorous style, said that no Country Party member had got into this House with 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact when I was first elected to this House I received more than 50 per cent of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the place where the <span class="highlight">vote</span> counts, in the Senate, the Country Party marshalls its votes, all 5 of them - I think it has 5 senators there - and by their <span class="highlight">vote</span> they say: ‘Not on your life’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With 18-year-olds being granted the <span class="highlight">vote</span>, the number of constituents in the electorate at the moment eligible to be on the roll if an election were to be held tomorrow would be between 90,000 and 95,000- nearly 100,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senators <span class="highlight">vote</span> either as individuals or on Party lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the members of the Senate have never voted on State lines, and honourable members know it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are independents there who <span class="highlight">vote</span> as independents because of particular political ideologies and the points of view that they have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Otherwise, members of the Senate <span class="highlight">vote</span> on Party lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Members of the Australian Democratic Labor Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> as a party, whether they come from Tasmania or Queensland; they are Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the one place in which they say: ‘We will not let the Canberra people have their <span class="highlight">vote</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Which way do you <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members opposite <span class="highlight">vote</span> against these proposals they are voting against the principle that every Australian is entitled to a say in his Government and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this and the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Surely if the people want 2 Liberals, 2 Labor members or 2 Democratic Labor Party members and they <span class="highlight">vote</span> that way they are entitled to have them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for the Northern Territory asked what would be done about giving the people of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory a <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums on constitutional matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that people in the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory should be able to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on referendums but I am not at all confident that when we introduce legislation into this Parliament to give effect to such a proposition, although the honourable member for the Northern Territory may <span class="highlight">vote</span> with us, his 5 colleagues in the Senate will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Country Party has the phoney attitude of suggesting things for which they are never prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> when the Labor Party brings the necessary legislation to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  colleagues in this House may <span class="highlight">vote</span> with him but he has no more influence with the 5 Country Party senators than I have, although he is a member of the same Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I admit that during the term of the previous Government not many days were devoted to private members’ business but he could well have introduced a proposal to enable residents of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only way to establish whether a member is a man of principle who supports the things he espouses is to see how he votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this is such a bad Bill, as the honourable member for the Northern Territory suggested, why will he <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was one member who did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Government on the last occasion when 17 members opposite voted with us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He could do so because, unlike the honourable member for the Northern Territory, he did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the earlier occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have been particularly fair whether printing material for the Country Party, which is one of the parties in our country which receives 8 per cent of the votes and therefore should be acknowledged, or the Democratic Labor Party which is also a party in our country which receives almost 8 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-54-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is one thing about this Minister and that is he does seem to attract a large <span class="highlight">vote</span> irrespective of what position he holds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If ever I had to <span class="highlight">vote</span> to nationalise an industry of this country, I would hope it would be the liquor interests of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said that the women of the electorate of Lilley should <span class="highlight">vote</span> Labor for a number of reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is lilywhite with fear because he knows that, with his 35 <span class="highlight">vote</span> majority, the stalling of the development of the Brisbane airport could well cost him his seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned earlier, a special pamphlet was issued during the campaign for the last election which stated: ‘Why will women <span class="highlight">vote</span> Labor in Lilley?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is anxious to encourage informed discussion and rational action in the labour field and I have taken the initiative in obtaining a small sum to be included in my Department’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> to enable a small number of overseas experts on labour matters to come to Australia each year to give us the benefit of their knowledge and experience and to stimulate the thinking of Australian practitioners in the labour field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-36-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The enrolment of voters is going on right now across the nation and in November, in each of 41 electoral areas, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people will <span class="highlight">vote</span> to elect one representative to come to Canberra to consult with and advise the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well to talk in terms of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value but this is a very hackneyed phrase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What does the phrase ‘one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value’ mean? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would reach a position of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value only if a redistribution was made immediately after a census was taken and if we were able to ensure that no one moved in or out of an electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be impossible to achieve the objective of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value unless an election was held on the day on which the census was taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So this talk about one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value is a lot of nonsense and I am pleased to see that even those who were doubting- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In real and practical terms it is not possible to achieve a practical situation of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But no one can say that the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value applies in respect of Senate representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is there any relevance of the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value in the Senate where the voters of Tasmania have the same number of representatives as the voters of New South Wales? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not a country in the world that has achieved the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value or applied it in practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government wishes to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against that it is voting against something which many people, including many who go to government schools, believe to be a fundamental right of parents, and it will be interesting to hear the Government’s intentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only exception to the amendments I have moved would be if the Minister were going to accept any part of those amendments, thus obviating the need for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on that part, but we might know that after the Minister responds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the Opposition wants certain amendments it has moved to clause 13 recommitted to enable a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be taken on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I gather that the Minister probably spoke to various people before the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken on the second occasion on which the matter was debated and influenced them to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the proposal put forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The evidence which was presented in the Senate and on the basis of which honourable senators voted is false, according to what the landholders themselves have told me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Prime Minister aware of the unanimous decision of the executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to campaign for a ‘no’ <span class="highlight">vote</span> on incomes in the proposed referendum? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said by some that there are no votes in defence these days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He has told us that the proportion of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be spent on new equipment has fallen to the lowest level in history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter had the support of the Australian people in an election and it is impertinent of the Opposition to suggest that it will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against both Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against both Bills and I hope that the Parliament will reject both of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And every so often they have to say in the course of spreading that harmony ‘<span class="highlight">Vote</span> No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would be screaming to high heaven for an increase, and so they were, but when we introduced a measure to increase our salaries honourable members opposite would not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it because they are phoneys. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he were concerned to save time this matter would have been put to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> 10 minutes ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the Minister for Overseas Trade  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  made an offer to this House that if the Opposition were prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the matter straight away that would save time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and they have to make up their minds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had a Minister in this place - a Leader of the House - telling us all that matters is the <span class="highlight">vote</span>, not the reasons or what the issue it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told that all that matters is the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Bradfield is a great reformer who talks one way in the Parliament and votes another way when the chips are down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no respect at all for those people who will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> as they think because in this place it is how you <span class="highlight">vote</span> that counts, not how you talk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Maranoa and the honourable member for Bradfield should put their votes where their hearts are and then we on this side of the Parliament will believe that they are fair dinkum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government was elected on a party platform which had been framed in this regard in July 1971 and on a policy speech which I delivered last November, committed to the proposition that local government in each State should have a voice and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Loan Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole proposition of giving local government a voice and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Loan Council could, in the opinion of the Solicitor-General, be achieved by amending the Financial Agreement of 1927 pursuant to the referendum which was carried in 1928. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members would not do that, it is equally wrong to <span class="highlight">vote</span> that the law should continue as it is because they are then acting as judges, to say that this man can be sent to gaol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known that some 5 per cent or 6 per cent fewer people <span class="highlight">vote</span> in by-elections than in general elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It so happens that at the Parramatta by-election 7 per cent or 8 per cent fewer people voted than normally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the Greensborough by-election 6 per cent or 7 per cent fewer people voted than normally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put these points against the background that yesterday the Opposition voted against both the second and third readings of the Australian Industry Development Corporation Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could not honestly have voted against that Bill unless we <span class="highlight">vote</span> also against the second and third readings of this Bill ‘because they are so closely interlocked in their functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the statements made by the Leader of the Country Party were a clear <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence in the integrity of the people who will be running this Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And at the same time it has perpetrated a monstrous confidence trick upon the people who <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From memory, not one member of the Country Party has ever won more than SO per cent of the primary votes before being elected to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A couple of years ago he was elected on 27 per cent of the primary <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said in the House that I would <span class="highlight">vote</span> against a prices and income referendum when it occurred and that I would advocate to the maximum of my capacity that people <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope, therefore, that we can look forward to a relatively short debate before the matter is taken to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is being declared an urgent measure because the Country Party has fought to let the people know that it is opposed to it, but members of that Party did not have the guts to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it, except on one minor amendments a few moments ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are casting one of their most intelligent votes on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members on the Government side had any decency they would <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this motion of no confidence because they know that, while they temporarily have a majority in this House, if we were counting the votes of the people instead of the votes of the members of the Labor Party Caucus to the last inch the majority of the votes would be for this coalition of the Liberal Party and the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We know that the Labor back benchers, despite their alarm at the disastrous activities of some of their Ministers, despite their horror at the scandals that have rocked this Parliament, despite their anger with some, of the Prime Minister’s decisions which they have been forced to overturn, and despite their disgust with the Government’s hopelessness in dealing with the savage inflation that is wracking this nation, will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bench of the New South Wales Industrial Commission would probably have resigned if the offer had been accepted because it would have been a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and a mark of complete no confidence in the New South Wales industrial jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>General business has been called on on every occasion and with one exception taken to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That matter will be voted on tomorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that if these quarterly adjustments are to be reintroduced by legislation then a ‘yes’ <span class="highlight">vote</span> would be needed for the incomes question in the referendum to be held on 8 December? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever the decision is to be made my <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be recorded for Capital Hill which I believe offers the greatest possible advantages for the building of a parliament house of which we would all be proud. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no alternative but to support the proposition moved by the honourable member for Corio, which is that the question go to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of both Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must go to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> by both Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason I believe that I should support the proposal made by the honourable member for Corio, and in supporting his proposal I indicate to honourable members that when the opportunity comes to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the site I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Capital Hill site. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have voted for it in the past and I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it on this occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that in all of the words that are being used and in all of the speeches that are being made we are in grave danger of losing sight of the 2 propositions that we are called upon to consider and to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Presumably, irrespective of what this House decides today, members of this Parliament will have a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the joint sitting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">vote</span> was to be taken on the site for the new building. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happened when we voted in this place on the site? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we took a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this House and I think there was a majority of 11 for Camp Hill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken in the Senate and there was a majority of about 40 for Capital Hill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That did not take place because we would not let the Senate dominate the final <span class="highlight">vote</span> at that stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But today I am going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the motion moved by the honourable member for Corio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that we are making an historic decision when we <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this House on this matter today, whichever way the <span class="highlight">vote</span> goes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Although, after the shocking performance of the Oppostion in yesterday’s censure motion, my comments are not as current as they were last week, I rise to express my complete disgust and contempt for the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Australian Country Party in its party room to deny the Government the Appropriation Bill and the actions of various Liberal members who are advocating denial of Supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Labor Party had to win some 505,042 votes above that figure to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the referendum is held next year, my advice is that you should <span class="highlight">vote</span> yes to give local governsent access to the Australian Loan Council and a voice at the national financial table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If you can tell me why and satisfactorily explain the situation, I might <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Country Party’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As such I would hope that the amendments which will be introduced to that legislation in the Senate will be all too clear and that the people who are now sending us telegrams to pressure our colleagues in the Senate to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Schools Commission Bill regardless of amendments will see that there is something to be gained if they just wait for the intelligent amendments which will be introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would say that at the moment in order to combat inflation this is one of the few things which the Government is doing which is likely to be extremely effective in this direction but, of course, the Government’s policy, which is well conceived, is subverted by the free <span class="highlight">vote</span> of Caucus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will give the Liberal Party due credit because it says, in its official how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> sheet which is issued State-wide, that it recommends a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to the official Country Party candidate, the sitting member  Mr J.

    <p>If honourable members read through some of the speeches made by  Mr Charlie  Griffiths while he was the member for Shortland they will read some most interesting material not only about the pre-selection for the Federal seat of Shortland, to which I will not refer, but also about the whole attitude of the Labor Party in New South Wales to <span class="highlight">vote</span> rigging and bribery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe with conviction that the exploitation of postal voting is such that it could prevent a party going out of office and ensure a party coming into power, depending upon which party is on its feet and is more agile in whizzing around and obtaining these votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the present system legislation requires all persons over 18 years of age to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the Australian figures we see that in 1966 there were well over 100,000 postal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact there were approximately 150,000 postal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The political parties then gather together all the postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> application forms and work their organisation in such manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest for the consideration of the Minister the implementation of the following practice: Considering that the Commonwealth requires people to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, I believe that the Government has a responsibility to make it possible for those people who are confined to bed or who are too old or ill to go to a polling booth to have easy access to a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present system enables the electoral officer of each division to mark against the name in his master roll the name of a particular person who previously had a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the ground of being aged or infirm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it is appropriate, following the honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron),  for me as a Government supporter, although I have not had the length of experience that the honourable member has had either in parliamentary terms or iri postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> organisation terms, to say that the Government is very conscious of the rackets and rorts that are being worked in postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> collection, Of course, over the years these have been accentuated, developed and perfected under the Liberal-Country Party governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not like the honourable member’s holier than thou’ attitude nor particularly did I like his statement that his organisation had not been guilty of any of these breaches and abuses of postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> organisation during an election campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take this opportunity of reminding him of completed postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> application forms with the names and addresses filled in that have been sent out by his organisation together with an accompanying letter, not signed by the honourable member naturally because he would not breach the Electoral Act, but signed by a responsible officer, usually his campaign director - and posted to people throughout the electorate on the basis of the the card index system of postal votes for the previous election that he keeps. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had copies of these completed postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> application forms which were given to me by people in his electorate who had received them from him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To fool the people concerned - very often they are aged and infirm people who are put on the so-called postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> list - the form has on the front of it the stamp of the divisional returning officer, copied by the political party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me go further and remind the honourable member for Griffith of the blatant misuse of the privilege of allowing people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> by post that was carried out during the last election campaign by his friend, the dishonourable - I mean the honourable - member for Lilley in the days of the last Parliament, Kevin Cairns, the great architect of virtue, the Democratic Labor Party member of the last Parliament who sat in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He abused every privilege that he had, including using an employee of the divisional returning officer for Lilley - a poor unfortunate woman whom he got hold of and on whom he used his vicious influence to get her to send out propaganda for him and to send out together with the ballot papers for the postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> applicant a how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> card for Kevin Cairns, the Liberal candidate for Lilley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would not be a party to any malpractices in postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> collections! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can a sitting member for Parliament do anything lower than to send out howtovote cards through an electoral office in order to try to save one’s political hide? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will support any call that is honestly and sincerely made for the clearing up of the postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> rackets and rorts that are carried out at present and have been carried out for many years in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He came up to him and said ‘Give me that postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to make one short comment on a matter that was discussed earlier by the honourable memfor Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron),  namely, the obtaining of postal votes from elderly people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing more unedifying than to see canvassers on behalf of candidates scrambling for the votes of elderly and sick people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I offer very shortly the thought to the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  for inclusion in the legislation on electoral matters which he has foreshadowed he will bring down that the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> of people over 70 years of age should be voluntary and not compulsory, and the seeking of postal votes from those people by canvassers on behalf of candidates should be outlawed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would then have a truly voluntary <span class="highlight">vote</span> available to those people over the age of 70 who genuinely desire the <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and there are many who do desire to exercise their right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot help but feel that in many instances the real reason for the member receiving the pension has been forgotten, and the increase, or the size of the increase, is made according to what the Government of the day will think is popular in order to angle for the ex-servicemen’s <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he turns to the Hansard record of the debate on the Estimates in 1970 he will find that when I sat on the other side of the chamber I said to his predecessor that no longer could he count on my <span class="highlight">vote</span> for an increase in postal charges without my previously carefully and scrupulously investigating the reasons for the increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The national Parliament has not had time to debate and to examine the questions so that honourable members in their turn can make their own rightful judgment on how they should <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A day’s debate is devoted to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the end of the debate the Government win, but all seem satisfied by the empty baying that has preceded the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To say that this is a trivial matter, that it does not require debate and that nothing said in this place will be noted by the people when they <span class="highlight">vote</span>, is simply to misconceive the whole situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is worried about the people of Australia having to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at elections too frequently, it has the cure in its own hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This populist way of doing things is being followed so that people going to the Senate election will be, it is hoped by the Government, led to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Australian Labor Party in the Senate election because they are supporting the referendum proposal which they have before them at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that people do not like to have to go along frequently to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and that, more particularly, the Party supporters do not like to have to go along frequently and put things in letter boxes, hand out how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> cards and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those honourable members directly opposite, representing much less than 50 per cent of the Australian electorate, and those who sit in the corner of the House, representing less than 10 per cent of the electorate, now have decided that they, the minority parties in this country, will not let the Australian people have even a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on a measure of such great importance to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, we have those people opposite who call themselves democrats telling the Australian people that they do not even trust them to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in that case, will he include the fact that he spoke and voted in this Parliament to stop the people from even having a say in the making of their laws? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our present system requires the elector to cast his <span class="highlight">vote</span> on an excessive number of occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1950. electors have been called upon to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in 9 Senate elections, 8 House of Representatives elections and 2 referendums, excluding State and local government elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Voters would know the choice before them - the election of a government - and could be more confident that the government so elected could effectively carry out its mandate, while political parties would be able better to plan their campaigns and formulate policies for government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Senate has the power at any time to reject legislation, provided that the number of senators who are in favour of such rejection <span class="highlight">vote</span> that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of that motion there will be a total of 15 minutes within which it will be necessary for him to present the substance of the change, the arguments on it and then for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that a case can be set out for the retention of that independence, related alone to the fact that when elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives are out of phase people register a more meaningful <span class="highlight">vote</span> for their senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In an attempt to frustrate the recording of the constitutional <span class="highlight">vote</span> required on these Bills, 2 devices were used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every member of the Australian Labor Party in every Parliament in Australia makes a collective decision, usually after proper discussion, very often after preliminary consideration by committees, on any matter which comes to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in his Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is soliciting the support of electors in that electorate to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the New South Wales Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By the second, we aim to give a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referendums to the people of our mainland Territories - the Australian Capital Territory, including Jervis Bay, and the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a clear majority of the electors who <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a referendum are in favour of a proposed law, their  will should not be frustrated because separate majorities of electors have not been obtained in a majority of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee’s proposal would not disturb the federal fabric of the Constitution, inherent in Section 128, but its proposal would serve to lay more emphasis on constitutional change by the democratic process of majority <span class="highlight">vote</span> than there at present exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This provision, in respect of the requirement to have ‘a majority of the States’ as one of the conditions for the passing of a referendum, does not, in our view, put the right emphasis and value on a national <span class="highlight">vote</span> and imposes an undesirable rigidity on the system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are one nation, we are one people, and on national issues it is desirable that the will of the nation should be determined more by the total <span class="highlight">vote</span> of all the people entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> than by State borders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the two-thirds majority is unreasonably high and, given that we have not gone beyond the original six States, means in the elegant words of the Constitutional Review Committee that ‘for every State in which there is an adverse <span class="highlight">vote</span> there must be a favourable <span class="highlight">vote</span> in two States … a constitutional change has to be supported not only by a majority of States but by two-thirds of the States.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is designed to remove the anomaly that Australian citizens in our mainland Territories have no voice or <span class="highlight">vote</span> in constitutional referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are 264,000 Australian citizens in the two Territories^ - the Australian Capital Territory, including Jervis Bay, and the Northern Territory - of whom 130,700 are voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is wrong that residents of the Territories should be denied a <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They, too, are entitled to the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this Bill we seek to delete from the Constitution that part of section 128 which limits voting at referendums to people qualified to <span class="highlight">vote</span> ‘in each State’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this proposal is carried, electors in the Territories will have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in all subsequent referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly those words have been chosen because they are words which will appeal to members of the public when they come along to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Electors are those who are qualified to be enrolled and to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The value of an elector’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> will vary greatly depending on which suburb he lives in or whether he lives in the city or in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, under the Constitution we have total power to say that everyone who has red hair and is 10 years of age can have a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Laws made by the Parliament for the purposes of this section shall be such that every Australian citizen who complies with any reasonable conditions imposed by those laws with respect to residence in Australia or in a part of Australia and with respect to enrolment and has attained the age of 18 years is, subject to any disqualification provided by  those  laws with respect to persons of unsound mind or undergoing imprisonment for an offence, entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is that every Australian citizen shall have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second proposition is that everybody 18 years of age and over shall have the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not a person in Australia who enrols, and who is not of unsound mind or undergoing imprisonment, who is not entitled already to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the House of Representatives or the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, every Australian has the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and the 2 Houses - the House of Representatives and the Senate - are chosen by the direct <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other proposition put forward is that every person 18 years of age and over should have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has any honourable member forgotten that earlier this year, with the support of all parties, all members of this House and all members of the Senate, we conferred a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on all people aged eighteen and over? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the Government we are going to the people to ask them to give everybody direct power to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and everybody who is aged eighteen or more the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides that every Australian citizen who complies with reasonable conditions about enrolment shall have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for all Australian Parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is one chamber only in Australia which is not elected by the direct <span class="highlight">vote</span> of every State citizen, and that is the upper House of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That House has existed to this day, and its members are elected by the combined <span class="highlight">vote</span> of all members of both Houses of the legislature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other provision in clause 7 is that everybody over 18 years of age shall have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for State elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all States 18 year olds already have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> or will have by the next election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, why do we need a constitutional referendum to force the States to provide a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for 18 year olds when the States have already given it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the most poorly thought out pieces of legislation that has ever been put before this Parliament as a proposal on which the people of Australia should <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument in support of there being a variation in the quota was related to the lack of capacity of those living in isolated places adequately to communicate with one another and indeed to exercise the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Opposition the then honourable member for Gippsland,  Mr McLean,  complained that citizens in country areas had to travel long distances in order to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He claimed that one of the consequences was that many citizens in country areas were unable to exercise their right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it provides for equality of the value of votes as between the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value was clearly intended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my argument that the concept as between State representation in this Parliament is on the basis of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value is a principle which must be upheld. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has often been said by Opposition spokesmen over the years that the party which has received the majority <span class="highlight">vote</span> has always been in government in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 3 occasions in the last decade the Australian Labor Party has received substantially more votes than the Liberal-Country Party candidates but did not have a majority of seats in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1954 the Australian Labor Party received just over 50 per cent of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1961 the Australian Labor Party received about 48 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal-Country Parties received less than 42 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>, but they formed the government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1969 the Australian Labor Party received 47 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it any wonder that they oppose giving to the Australian people the right to have a say as to whether there should be equal representation, whether there should be upheld in this country the concept of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> having equal value to another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a Prime Minister so dedicated to the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value as the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  is, it is remarkable that he has introduced a Bill which will take us further away from that principle than we are now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill before us -  - would result in the greatest departure from the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> - one value ever seen in the history of Australian House of Representatives elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years, the Labor Party has claimed that in the absence of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, country people in Australia have enjoyed an unfair voting strength against the people of the city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are being asked to support a proposal which would result in the votes of urban workingclass people, for want of a better term, having the highest value; the votes of country people having a lesser value; and the votes of urban middle-class electors having the lowest value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister wants the electors in such areas to have proxy votes for the people who are ineligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, the Prime Minister wants the parents to have proxy votes on behalf of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means, of course, that if the Prime Minister’s proposal had applied in 1969, and electorates had equal populations, one <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Sydney would have been worth 1.7 votes in the electorate of Robertson for example. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a far bigger departure from one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value than actually occurred in 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet this is what the Prime Minister - this great champion and protector of the sacred law of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value - wants the Australian people to approve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using the same kind of example in Melbourne, one <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the electorate of Melbourne would have been worth 1.77 votes in Diamond Valley - an even bigger departure from one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value than would have occurred in New South Wales in 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1969, there were 43,409 voters actually enrolled in Darling, compared with 62,087 in Parramatta. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet if the Prime Minister’s proposal had applied in 1969, there would have been, for example in Sydney, 42,999 voters on the roll, and 67,878 in Robertson - a far greater prostitution of the electoral laws than the Labor Party has always claimed already exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Victoria in 1969 there were 45,457 voters in Mallee and 58,776 in Batman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Prime Minister, under his proposal, would have seen to it that there were 38,788 voters in Melbourne, for example, and 64,709 in Diamond Valley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These illustrations serve to completely destroy any claim the Labor Party has ever had to really stand for the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Speaker,  because the Australian Country Party is implacably opposed to these two fundamental provisions of the Bill, it will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here is a Party one of the members of which, sitting in the back, the honourable member for McMillan  (Mr Hewson),  was elected on 16.63 per cent of the primary votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Labor Party candidate who was defeated got 48 per cent of the primary votes and the Liberal Party candidate polled 24 per cent, with the Democratic Labor Party candidate getting 8 per cent and the Independent candidate 6 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why, he has a Party that since 1949 has only once polled more than 10 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the people but has exercised 16 or 20 per cent of the power in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why would he not want a system that has given the Country Party the premiership and government in Queensland on 19 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who would <span class="highlight">vote</span> for them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The gerrymandering of electoral boundaries and the creation of electoral zones with the essential purpose of varying the value of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> between such zones have been the typical means of frustrating the popular will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, electors in the country zone are given a disproportionate value for their <span class="highlight">vote</span> relatively to electors in the central area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, by the method of dividing a State into two unequal zones, electors in these zones are given different values for the <span class="highlight">vote</span> which they cast in a system which is supposedly democratic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be precise, an elector in a New South Wales country zone has a <span class="highlight">vote</span> worth 1.37 times that of an elector in the rest of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of an elector in Murray is worth 1.73 times the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of an elector in Mt Druitt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Victoria, zoning systems are used to destroy the principle of equal representation and to distort the value of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, the value of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the second zone is worth 2.07 times the value of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Southern Zone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Western and Far Northern Zone is worth almost twice the value of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the South Eastern zone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only in this way can the Country Party gain election in that State with 19 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and win more seats than the Liberal Party or the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, if an election for this House were held tomorrow, an elector in Maranoa would have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> worth 1.83 times the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of an elector in Diamond Valley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way in which the evils of malapportionment can be banned from the Australian political scene for all time is to inscribe the principle of equal representation into our Australian Constitution - one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They ask you to do so by your <span class="highlight">vote</span> and to do so permanently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly),  who preceded me in this debate, has informed us that in the United States case, Wesbury v. Sanders (1964) the then Chief Justice of that country, Earl Warren - a man more noted for his political judgments than his knowledge of jurisprudence, as will become obvious - ruled that the relevant part of this Article should be interpreted as meaning that in United States Congressional elections - to use his own words - one man’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a Congressional election (in the  United  States) is to be worth as much as anothers’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the appropriate way to determine the numbers of electors in each State division is by means of a quota of electors properly enrolled and legally entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, not the number of people including the very young - even .the one and 2-year- olders and up to the 17-year old group - and the migrants who have not become naturalised citizens of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The voters are the people who determine the results of the elections and they should be the people who count. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, the proposal cuts directly across the Labor Party principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, and is inconsistent with Labor’s alleged fundamental philosophy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor’s proposal means that every <span class="highlight">vote</span> is not equal in value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One <span class="highlight">vote</span> may represent one or even more than 1.5 people in the electorate, not one qualified elector, that is, an elector qualified to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an example, in an area with 50,000 migrants, many of whom are not yet naturalised, with 25,000 of them voting and 25,000 Australians voting there would be an electorate with 75,000 people and 50,000 voters, a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in which the actual voter would be worth 50 per cent more people than in an electorate with a predominantly Australian grouping. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would mean that the high density areas with a large percentage of people, not qualified to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, could strongly influence the results of the elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Labor thinks these high density areas are red ribbon Labor electorates with much more than average numbers of non voting people it would obviously falsify the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and any new electorates created by a spill-over would probably trend strongly towards Labor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, does the <span class="highlight">vote</span> at election time enable the party which polls the majority of votes to win the majority of seats? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor polled only 49.6 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> but won 53.6 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taken to extremes, has the Labor Party taken to heart Neville Shute’s views as expressed in his book ‘In the Wet’ that some people should have as many as 7 votes - a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for himself, his marriage, his family, his property, his overseas travel, his war service, and his service to the Queen? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One point that became evident after listening to Opposition speakers was that the great majority of Australians and particularly those who live in the larger cities, the provincial cities and towns, have been informed in no uncertain terms by Opposition members that their <span class="highlight">vote</span> should not have the same value as the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of people who live in the country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that this, in turn, will lead to the conduct of truly democratic elections by applying the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall deal with New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland to illustrate the manner in which the Liberal <span class="highlight">vote</span> fell and the Country Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between 1969 and 1972, while the Australian Labor Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> went up considerably in New South Wales, the Liberal Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> declined by 37,673 votes and the Country Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> rose by 14,593. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Victoria, the Liberal <span class="highlight">vote</span> dropped by 20,201 and the Country Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> increased by 20,200. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> and an increase of 35,000 in the Country Party <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the 1972 Federal elections the Australian Labor Party gained 49.6 per cent of the total primary <span class="highlight">vote</span> and won 67 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party received 32.1 per cent of that total <span class="highlight">vote</span> and had 38 members elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Country Party received 9.4 per cent of that <span class="highlight">vote</span> and that Party won 20 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that as a result of the Country Party manipulation, this minority group has 16 per cent of the total membership of this House, although its <span class="highlight">vote</span> was only 9.4 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span> recorded by the electors of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I indicated, it recorded 9.4 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> but has 16 per cent of the membership of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second factor is one which should be causing grave concern for every person in the community who believes in the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party received 430,476 votes, which was 48 per cent of the total votes cast, and had 33 members elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party received 201,608 votes, or 22 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and had 21 members elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In democratic Queensland, where the Country Party is in control of the coalition, the Country Party gained 181,288 votes - less than 20 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span> - and won 26 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Examining the results, it can be seen that Liberal Party candidates gained 20,320 votes more than their co-runners for 5 fewer seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, the combined votes of the Country Party and Liberal Party candidates totalled 382,896 or 47,580 fewer than the total ALP <span class="highlight">vote</span>, but won 14 seats more than the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, the present coalition Parties combined gained 42.2 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span> for 47 seats, and the ALP gained 48 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span> and won 33 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of this was the election of 17 Liberals who collectively gained 36.7 per cent of the city <span class="highlight">vote</span> and the election of 15 ALP candidates who collectively gained 51 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rotten position in Queensland as a result of political wheeling and dealing is that, at the 1972 State election, on average it took 13,045 votes to elect one ALP candidate, 9,600 votes to elect one Liberal and 6,972 votes to elect one Country Party member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have pointed out that the Country Party in this House has overrepresentation, if one considers the <span class="highlight">vote</span> it receives throughout the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is abusing its rights as a government by trying to stifle the Opposition and by trying to get this matter before the Australian people by stealth, hoping that in their ignorance they might cast a yes <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present it comprises 6 State representatives and 2 Commonwealth representatives with the Commonwealth having an additional casting <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister proposes to restructure the Loan Council so that there will be 6 State representatives, 6 local government representatives and an additional Commonwealth representative to make 4 Commonwealth votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, on matters affecting local government finance the States would be outnumbered and outvoted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Bill were passed the people would be asked to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the proposition we are now discussing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Loan Council the States would be outvoted on matters related to local government finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The method of distribution of loan money to local government would be decided by the collective <span class="highlight">vote</span> of local government and Commonwealth Government representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Australian people were to be asked to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on these proposals I would ask them to consider carefully the full implications of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, we promised to restructure the Loan Council so that local government representatives from all States could have a voice and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on that Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One was that elected local governments should have both a voice and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Loan Council and the other was that the Australian Government should be empowered to borrow on behalf of elected local governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know the terms of the referendum to be put to the people but this will be the end result if the people of Australia are stupid enough to <span class="highlight">vote</span> yes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the people of this country will <span class="highlight">vote</span> no at the referendum in such a resounding way that the Labor Party will never come back again trying to get their approval for this kind of socialistic legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an attempt to frustrate the recording of the constitutional <span class="highlight">vote</span> required - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then I proceeded to give an explanation of those Opposition attempts to frustrate the constitutional <span class="highlight">vote</span> being recorded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That local government in all States join together for the purpose of mounting a strong publicity campaign to inform the public on the importance to local government of a ‘Yes’ <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the proposed referendum concerning the admission of local government to the Australian Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, will the Prime Minister make it clear to the Australian people before they <span class="highlight">vote</span> on 8 December just what these criteria will be? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look first of all at clause 2 (c) of the Bill which proposes to alter section 128 of the Constitution to allow qualified electors in the Territories to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 264,000 citizens in these territories, of which 130,700 are eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention in passing that the 130,700 Territory votes will not be counted in the votes of the States in order to determine whether in a majority of the States a majority of the electors voting approve the proposed law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will apply only to the total Australian <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of such a proposed change would be that instead of the constitutional requirement that, before a referendum can be successful a majority of the electors in a majority of the States must <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of the proposal - that is, that there must be a majority of electors in four out of the six States and also a majority of all electors - in its place there would be a requirement that there must be a majority of electors in only 3 States out of six and a majority of all electors before the proposed law can be presented to the Governor-General for assent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It states that it is a Bill for an Act to facilitate alterations to the Constitution and to allow electors in Territories, as well as electors in the States, to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums on proposed laws to alter the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These received an overall <span class="highlight">vote</span> of 50.57 per cent and 50.3 per cent respectively but were supported in 3 States only, namely, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was carried in Victoria and Queensland only, yet it received the overall support of the Australian electorate - a 53.56 per cent <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a clear majority of the electors who <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a referendum are in favour of a proposed law, their will should not be frustrated because seperate majorities of electors have not been obtained in a majority of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second purpose of this Bill is to give electors of the Australian Capital Territory, including Jervis Bay and the Northern Territory, the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at constitution referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This fundamental growth and change indicates that in the future, unless this change is made, countless thousands of Australians will be denied their right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the ballot box for changes in the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is incredible that this Labor Government should have to take steps to remove the undemocratic, anomalous and unnecessary provision in the Constitution which denies this fundamental right at this date to 130,700 Australian voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely, the Australian Country Party must support a referendum to ask the people to give a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referendums to all people of our mainland Territories - the Australian Capital Territory, including Jervis Bay, and the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this does not mean that they will support the legislation because we have the example of their <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Territory senators legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this House on the first occasion they voted with the Government in favour of it, and then their counterparts in another place voted to defeat the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now they are being asked to let the people decide the issue, and I suggest that they give up their trapeze acts and <span class="highlight">vote</span> in accordance with what they say are their established political principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The restriction of the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in constitutional referendums to the citizens of the States is a consequence of the desire of the framers of our Constitution to protect the small States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our proposal is that the votes of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory electors be included in the national aggregate <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years, the citizens of the Territories have demanded this right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this legislation does is to seek the approval of the Parliament to give the Australian people the right to say whether their fellow men and women in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, including Jervis Bay, shall have the right to exercise their <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noticed during his speech that he was only emphasising the fact that the Government is trying to give Territorians, both in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, a right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is genuine in its offer to give Territorians the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums it is being most insincere about tacking paragraph (c) onto clause 2 of this Bill, hence our proposed amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that section 128 should be amended by deleting the words in each State’, as provided in clause 2 (a), so that Territorians would have a right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that we in the Territories should have this <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the Minister’s disparaging and inaccurate remarks, as usual, about the noise I was making or about my not having done anything about this - that was a complete falsehood - on referendum day in 1967 I was in the lead of a protest procession marching down the street carrying banners bearing such words as ‘60,000 voteless voices’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They asked whether he was aware that the citizens of the Australian Territories are not entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums and therefore in a series of referendums that have been foreshadowed in future months over a quarter of a million people living on the Australian mainland will be denied an opportunity to be represented in national votes on vital issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that we may get the full value out of the work of the Constitutional Convention, his matter of getting our <span class="highlight">vote</span> recorded somehow in referenda is of prime importance and should be looked at as a matter of urgency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would be very little difficulty in having the votes of Territorians registered and included in the overall <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Australian people- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of Australia simply won’t accept that they have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on 2 amendments to section 128. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Territory have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> but it ought to be on terms more carefully considered than this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remarks to which I have referred relate only to the question of the right of people in the Northern Territory to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then they said that if a general <span class="highlight">vote</span> had been accepted as a test, the Constitution would have been triumphantly adopted on 3 June 1898. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least we, as a Government, have taken the initiative for the first time in a quarter of a century to have public discussion on the Constitution and to give the people an opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> upon it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Bill for an Act To facilitate alterations to the Constitution and to allow Electors in Territories, as well as Electors in the States, to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at Referendums on Proposed Laws to alter the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To seek to alter that Constitution in a manner which is not clearcut is, in my view, a clear attempt to deceive the people because when this matter comes before the Australian people for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> there is nothing in the title of the Bill which refers to the 2 ways in which the Constitution is proposed to be altered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first relates to providing the residents of the Territories with an opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referenda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are citizens of Australia and they should have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referenda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot, as this proposal is presently before us, <span class="highlight">vote</span> for one and not the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> either f of both or for neither. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have to choose between their desire to give all electors the opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referenda, and their opposition perhaps to the alteration of the requirement in relation to a majority of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and on national issues it is desirable that the will of the nation should be determined more by the total <span class="highlight">vote</span> of all the people entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> than by State borders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> was clear cut. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only would this in my mind be a more reasonable way, a more honest way, a more direct way and a more clear cut way of presenting the alternative propositions to the Australian people but also it would probably have the very real effect of giving the Australian people the opportunity of voting in favour of the measure proposing a constitutional change to give electors in the Territories the opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a referendum and also to express their opinion on the second proposal contained in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seeks to extend to all electors the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a referendum and it seeks to reduce the requirement that there should be, in addition to an absolute majority of electors in favour of a proposed amendment to the Constitution, also a majority in a majority of States supporting such a proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We agree completely with the remarks of Government supporters that it is a fundamental democratic principle that all electors should have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bait is offered that, by passing this Bill and supporting this referendum on which the Bill is based, we should give votes in a referendum to all electors in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic and short statement which is contained in the Bill and which will be put before the people can only mislead the people as to the question on which they will be casting a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is odd that one part of the proposition is spelt out in detail while the other part warrants no detail whatsoever in the mind of the Government, the other part being, of course, to allow electors in Territories as well as electors in the States to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums on proposed laws to alter the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is nothing other than an attempt to draw a veil of secrecy over what is being done to mislead the people as to the <span class="highlight">vote</span> they will be making at the referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have dealt with several in this chamber and the one before us today changes significantly the way in which a referendum is in fact passed through eliminating the necessity for it to be successful in a majority of States and also enables persons in the Territories of Australia to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referenda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, the Australian Country Party completely supports that part of the Bill which ensures that there will be a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for electors within the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory at referenda which will subsequently be submitted to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I were not normally a charitable socialist fellow I would, of course, think that my colleagues opposite were simply trying to have 2-bob each way, as the saying goes; in other words, that they would not give votes to the people of the Territories if it came to a single straight-forward <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the issue in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some areas honourable members may well have doubts as to whether they would <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the propositions put forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one of the miracles of Australian public life, considering the fact that there are still people like that here, that 80 years ago we were able to have Constitutional Conventions and to enhance the tremendous document that is the government arrangements of Australia, as a result of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one were able to enshrine the arguments of other honourable members opposite he would have to say that that is not a true <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of times the Liberal and Country Parties of Australia have achieved an absolute majority of the votes is minimal indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, I hope the House will <span class="highlight">vote</span> unanimously for these procedures and that honourable members will all get out and start to work among the people of Australia to accept a national attitude towards the Australian Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>shall be submitted in each State and Territory to the electors qualified to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the election of members of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>either with or without any amendments subsequently agreed to by both Houses, to the electors in each State and Territory qualified to <span class="highlight">vote</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed law …. shall be submitted to the electors qualified to <span class="highlight">vote</span> …. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not dispute - indeed I support it - the contention that we should also allow the electors in the Territories to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and that their <span class="highlight">vote</span> should be counted in determining the overall majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the second reading debate I and other honourable members on the Opposition said that the critically important factor for us when considering the first proposal in relation to paragraph (a) of clause 2 was to ensure that the residents of the Territories - that is the Australian Capital Territory, including Jervis Bay, and the Northern Territory - should have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> if they are qualified under the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have no hesi tation in repeating now in emphatic words, that we want those people to get a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out that there are 264,000 citizens in the 2 Territories and of those 130,700 are entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provided it is ensured that the 130,700 people qualified to <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, we as an official Opposition, will be prepared to support paragraph (a) of clause 2. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it and will take it to a division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>result of that would be that instead of a majority of electors in 4 of the 6 States, and also a majority of all electors being required to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the proposal, the Government would need only a majority of electors in 3 of the 6 States and a majority of all electors before action could be taken by the GovernorGeneral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not understand that anybody at the Constitutional Convention - certainly not the representatives from the 2 Territories - had proposed that the people in the 2 Territories should be denied a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referendums any longer than was necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of them at the Constitutional Convention demurred at the proposition that a referendum to give the people in the Territories a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in subsequent referendums should be held at the earliest possible moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of requiring a majority of States, which at present means 4 out of 6 States and thus a two-thirds majority of the States, what the Government is proposing is that a majority of voters in not less than half the States will be necessary for the carriage of an amendment to the Constitution, as well, of course, as an overall majority of voters in the whole of the continent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present provision means - I quote the report of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review:  for every State in which there is an adverse <span class="highlight">vote</span> there must be a favourable <span class="highlight">vote</span> in two States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that we should go to any great lengths to facilitate changes unless there is a clear and unmistakable expression of opinion on the part of the Australian people who are themselves qualified to <span class="highlight">vote</span> - the people of this country in whom the sovereign or quasi-sovereign power resides - that a change is necessary or desirable or unless the Government has clearly and honestly come to the conclusion that these qualified people themselves desire that an amendment to the Constitution be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A Bill for an Act to facilitate alterations to the Constitution and to allow Electors in Territories, as well as Electors in the States, to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at Referendums on Proposed Laws to alter the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The title will then go on to say: ‘and to allow Electors in the States, to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at Referendums on Proposed Laws to alter the Constitution’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All this talk of the absence of threat is a smokescreen for a decision to save money from the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> for other purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, it has bitten deeply into the long lead equipment items - for example, DDLs and replacement for the Neptunes - so that the proportion of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> spent on capital equipment has fallen to its lowest level ever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say to those who talk about defence procurement that the Cabinet has determined that there will be a destroyer program but we are not satisfied and indeed we were not satisfied - the honourable member for Isaacs shared this concern, as I have already pointed out - that the Government had sufficient information and detail to allow us to go ahead with a program of such magnitude which would involve this country and indeed this Government in an expenditure of no less than 25 per cent of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a number of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Army Board had in effect said was that if the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> was to be reduced from 3.5 per cent of the gross national product to less than 3 per cent of GNP, one of the many ways in which such a reduction could be achieved was by getting rid of the bands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, in the light of the thousands of signatures requesting a review of this decision, not only from the public but also from the Returned Soldiers League and leading citizens who are, after all, also voters, I ask the Minister to reverse this decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gloom mongering and fear have become the only tactic of Opposition parties, and their negative approach is somewhat summed up by their advocacy of a no’ <span class="highlight">vote</span> to both the prices and incomes referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That satisfaction went a long way towards securing an affirmative <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the recent ballots. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I remember rightly - I will look at the record - he walked out; he did not <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first is that the authority to market the Australian wheat crop firmly belongs with the Australian Wheat Board which has 10 grower members who are democratically elected by the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the rank and file in 3 States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government will probably, by a number of manoeuvres, seek to minimise the effect of this country <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I said that there was one condition on which I would join the Labor Party, in terms of its past exercise in trying to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against wine excise which, by the way with 50 per cent off, would have been a damned sight better than what is levied on the industry today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The figures relating to the Gosford electorate were:  Mr Brooks,  Liberal, received 10,319 votes or 52.4 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>;  Mr Dunbar,  Democratic Labor Party received 637 votes or 3.2 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>; and  Mr McGowan,  Australian Labor Party, received 8,744 votes or 44.4 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is another State seat called Peats which is also totally within the electorate of Robertson and the figures relating to this seat were:  Mr Hallett,  Liberal, received 10,458 votes or 42.1 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>; and  Mr O’Connell,  Labor, received 14,397 votes or 57.9 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The figures for the third seat of Munmorah, two-thirds of which is in the electorate of Robertson, were as follows:  Mr Connolly,  DLP, received 1,262 votes or 5.1 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>;  Mr Jackson,  Liberal, received 7,649 votes or 30.4 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>; and  Mr Jensen,  Labor, received 16,215 votes or 64.5 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly, the split up on a two-party preferred basis was: Gosford - Labor 45.5 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and Liberal 54.5 per cent; PeatsLabor, 57.9 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and Liberal 42.1 per cent; and Munmorah - Labour, 66 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and Liberal, 34 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor <span class="highlight">vote</span> was roughly 57 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Robertson, so I would ask the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  to go back to school to learn about mathematics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason we are seeking a ‘yes’ <span class="highlight">vote</span> on 8 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is not without some significance that only last week Labor recorded the worst <span class="highlight">vote</span> that it has recorded since 1932 in the rural areas of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our decision not to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for clause 66 which repeals the across-the-board approach, the Opposition is in fact helping the Government to keep its own promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> was put on that basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the Opposition will press these amendments and <span class="highlight">vote</span> on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that the Opposition has voted for the second reading and will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the third reading and the passage of every cent of funds allocated by this Government to further education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will have noted with dismay that the Opposition is destroying the Schools Commission as surely in this way as if it had used its Senate majority to <span class="highlight">vote</span> down the Bill at the second reading stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are voting, or they are supposed to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, or they were supposed to <span class="highlight">vote</span> - I do not know what the actual- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the <span class="highlight">vote</span> a representative decision of woolgrowers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Country Party would argue that because fewer than SO per cent voted it is not true representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But anybody who has a look at the facts behind this issue will see that the Country Party can thank its lucky stars that the others did not <span class="highlight">vote</span>, because if they were supporters of the Country Party they would have been there in droves to have a shot at this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they had voted it would have made an even greater majority in favour of the embargo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They allege that intimidatory practices were used against Aboriginal persons to force them to <span class="highlight">vote</span>; that is, they were told that if they failed to <span class="highlight">vote</span> the normal entitlement of citizens to such things as social services would be withheld. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, during the elections certain militant Aborigines in their genuine concern to stop the farce - that is what they call it - forced blacks away from the polls so they could not <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aborigines everywhere have complained that the time allowed between voter registrations, the nomination of candidates and the actual voting day did not allow sufficient time to permit the people to become acquainted with the true function of the body to be elected or with the processes of nomination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is not a democratic process because the points outlined are being forced on the people as white superstructures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First and foremost, I do not dispute at all the decision of those wool growers who cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the export of a limited number of merino rams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people have the idea that a certain amount of apathy existed among wool growers to this question as fewer than 50 per cent of those eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span> cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of those people who, according to the rules, regulations or conditions laid down by the present Government, were eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, in actual fact had no interest in this matter at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happened was tantamount to saying that, if the wheat growers were to participate in a ballot on an issue specific to their industry, oat growers, rice growers and growers of other cereals should also be invited to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in making that decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, a number of people eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span> were not the slightest bit interested in casting a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want the Australian people to know that whatever percentage of those eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span> did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> - I have heard the figure 53 per cent mentioned - a number of those people literally had no interest in voting on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that the decision of the Government made some months ago to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue by all wool growers was completely wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was put to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this House a couple of days ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well to recollect that while Opposition leaders are so solicitous of the category A schools they did not venture to put to the <span class="highlight">vote</span> a proposition which would have benefited those schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By implication, throughout the election campaign last year every member of the then Opposition was saying to the parents of children in the private schools: ‘You can <span class="highlight">vote</span> Labor, and the principle of per capita grants will be retained’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his speech which opened the election campaign and which persuaded the Australian people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Australian Labor Party the Prime Minister said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact we voted for it in this House, and we made it perfectly clear at the time that we did <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other problems with the members of the Country Party is that once they demand it in their own bailiwick they hope that it is not the one chosen because unfortunately decentralisation brings with it people who are known as urban voters and who inevitably <span class="highlight">vote</span> not for the Country Party but for the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The consequence of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> which the Opposition sought in the House of Representatives would have been an additional expenditure even greater than the honourable gentleman has suggested in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the attitude of my colleague the Minister for Education, who for reasons which are known and regretted by all honourable gentlemen is not here today, and I subscribed to the proposition which my colleague moved in the House on 26 September last and neither he, I believe, nor I then or later have departed from what was there put to the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on his initiative in the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To make the position quite clear, because such aspersions are constantly made about him and about me, I shall repeat the motion which he moved and which he, I and all our colleagues now in Government supported by our <span class="highlight">vote</span> and which throughout the election campaign he and I put to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Department of Supply continues in existence, financed from the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>, under a directive from the Prime Minister maintaining at least for the time being a relationship with the Department of Defence through which the Minister for Supply and the Minister for Defence collaborate in the execution of relevant defence policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am asked whether I am going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> ‘Yes’ on Saturday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This referendum has nothing whatever to do with preventing the rate of inflation which this Government has allowed to take place and will continue to ensure takes place no ‘matter how people <span class="highlight">vote</span> next Saturday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that this is an opportunity for the House to debate the issues of the referendum of next Saturday and why one should <span class="highlight">vote</span> Yes, Yes or, presumably on the other side, why one should <span class="highlight">vote</span> No, No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am hopeful that next Saturday, for once, many of the polling booths of Australia will be untrammelled by ticket-pushers and that the public will be able to go along and cast its <span class="highlight">vote</span> as it ought to - Yes, Yes; No, No or Yes, No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, I have found no curious humans advocating No, Yes, although I have no doubt that some will <span class="highlight">vote</span> that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about the degree to which, in controlling inflation in the Australian community, there will be a beneficial effect from a Yes, Yes <span class="highlight">vote</span> advocated by the Government in Saturday’s referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about steps that the Government would implement if there were to be a positive <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  there is as yet no positive program from this Government, simply because I do not believe that many of them have their hearts in a Yes, Yes <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Professor Parkin is as distinguished an economist as any of those persons who signed a letter, published recently, to which I will advert in a moment, in which those persons supported a yes, yes <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the forthcoming referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, if there is to be a positive <span class="highlight">vote</span> for price control and a negative <span class="highlight">vote</span> for incomes control, the sorts of policies that would be introduced are said not only by Professor Parkin but also by many in the community to lead to a complete distortion of the normal market forces in our community, to the development of black marketeering and to the development of pressures to supply goods which are not influenced by market demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, it is nonsense for the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  or for the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to claim that the reason why they are advocating a yes <span class="highlight">vote</span> is to contain inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only reason why they are advocating a yes <span class="highlight">vote</span> is that they seek more power for the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What we are asking the people to do is to <span class="highlight">vote</span> Yes next Saturday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If they <span class="highlight">vote</span> Yes on Saturday, we may be able to bring some rational development to our country and be able to make land available at a reasonable price to young people in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ;an do that if the people <span class="highlight">vote</span> Yes and give this Parliament the authority to control land prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian people are facing a referendum on Saturday which will change the whole course of their future if they <span class="highlight">vote</span> Yes, Yes, and accept a vague promise of ‘Let us do something about prices’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that in the course of this debate we have been able to rouse the Australian people to the dangers of voting Yes, Yes to give these powers to a Government that does nothing but think in terms of vague slogans while it is after the people’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> and then puts the boot in afterwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The economists say so clearly that if the referenda on 8 December are not carried the opportunity will be lost for many years and therefore they advocate for a yes <span class="highlight">vote</span> on both questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be necessary for the Government to act through the Prices Justification Tribunal and the use of its prices power, if the people next Saturday <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Government proposal for a price control power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the people <span class="highlight">vote</span> on that proposal sensibly and wisely in their own interest, we can ensure that the benefits of the tariff reduction on television sets will be passed on to the consumer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We heard at the outset of the speech of the Leader of the Country Party a reference to his real motive in raising this matter of public importance today and we heard him return to it at the end of his speech, namely, a plea to the people of Australia to <span class="highlight">vote</span> No on the referendum on prices control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The reports that I saw yesterday showed that something like 70 per cent of Australians who were polled in the recent Gallup polls indicated that they will <span class="highlight">vote</span> Yes on the prices control measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sum total of these proposals is that as the Constitution stands a majority of 4 out of 6 States together with a majority of all the eligible electors will need to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of any proposed alteration to the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Withnall  said that he would like to see them have a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, but that it ought to be on terms more carefully considered, on terms that seek to determine the exact way in which section 128 is to be amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope and trust that when the proposals are put they will be beaten decisively and that when the people of this country - I repeat that after all they are the sovereign people of this country - have an opportunity to express their view they will do so in an emphatic way; that is, that they will <span class="highlight">vote</span> no at the referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they required a direct <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the industry in that instance in order to ascertain the effect on growers rather than a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of appointed representatives, why did they not be consistent and stick to the same formula for the Apple and Pear Corporation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand the application of standing order 250 and the procedure which the Prime Minister is adopting, the Prime Minister is seeking to pre-empt any opportunity of parliamentary debate on an important constitutional matter on which the Government wishes the Australian people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a Commonwealth referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yesterday afternoon, the Canberra correspondent of the Melbourne ‘Sun News-Pictorial’ approached me and asked me whether I had written a letter to the Melbourne ‘Sun NewsPictorial’ advocating a No, No <span class="highlight">vote</span> at next Saturday’s referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place, I refer to the misuse of the stationery of this House; secondly, to the forgery of the signature of a member of this House to a letter for publication; thirdly, to the misrepresentation of the views of a member of this House who advocated a yes, yes <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the referendum; and, fourthly, to the misrepresentation of the legal position in the matter of the prices question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will have no trouble in recalling the way in which the Liberal Party inserted advertisements in the name of the convenor of the Australia Party,  Mr Gordon  Barton, at the time of the last election, encouraging Australia Party voters to depart from their Party card. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will have no trouble in recalling that in my own electorate of Casey the Liberal Party offered to pay the cost of printing the Australia Party how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> cards if it would change its preference allocation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As there is a strong possibilty that certain ballot papers have been either lost or stolen in the post, will the Postmaster-General institute an immediate inquiry into this matter in order to ascertain whether the ballot papers were ever posted and/or whether there was any interference with the mail in order to deprive electors from exercising their right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in what is a very close election? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he does agree with Professor Gruen on these matters, will he say so now so that the Australian people will be aware of the dangers of price control before they <span class="highlight">vote</span> on Saturday? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister consider that a Yes <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the prices referendum on Saturday will encourage a black market in land? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a Yes <span class="highlight">vote</span> is recorded at the referendum on Saturday and control over prices is given to this Parliament, it will mean that after legislation has been passed there will be authority to nominate any area with a view to stabilising land prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the people <span class="highlight">vote</span> Yes on Saturday, I believe that it will be a great step forward in stabilising land prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister whether he seeks a Yes <span class="highlight">vote</span> at Saturday’s referendum in order to transfer powers to the Federal Parliament in order to contain inflation or for some other reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, will the Prime Minister reaffirm that a Yes <span class="highlight">vote</span> on prices in Saturday’s referendum will not itself impose national price control on any goods and services? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will be remind the Australian people that even after the referendum is carried, despite the deception by people handing out how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> cards on behalf of but not in the name of the Liberal and Country Parties, no item will be subject to price control until appropriate legislation is subsequently passed by both Houses of this Australian Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That, in the opinion of this House, Australia’s National Anthem should not be changed without a total <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Australian people on suggested alternative anthems including ‘God Save The Queen’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be argued that never in the past were people given the chance to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on their national anthem, that it is usual for a decision to be made by the authorities of whatever sort and this decision simply handed on to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Community attitudes and expectations are such that people believe on issues such as this that not only should they have the opportunity to cast their <span class="highlight">vote</span>, but that indeed they have the right so to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be argued that it would take too long, or cost too much, to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of all eligible electors - that is all that is meant by the words ‘a total <span class="highlight">vote</span>’ - in other words a referendum on the question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is absolutely nothing to prevent this question being voted upon at the same time, at minimal cost to the Australian public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the cost of conducting a <span class="highlight">vote</span> adding this question to the decisions to be made in respect of other matters would most assuredly be less than the cost of sampling 60,000 Australians as is presently proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is a referendum, or a total <span class="highlight">vote</span>, a fair way to arrive at a decision? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>All Australians eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span> should have the right, as offered to them by the Prime Minister, to exercise their choice on this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That can be tested only by a full <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Australian people, with the opportunity of expressing an opinion on the present anthem being given to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is nothing in his motion to that effect, if we support this motion today we would be voting to require a total <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Australian people to decide the question - that is, every man, woman and child in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those honourable members on the other side of the House who are clamouring for a referendum on this issue, and the honourable member for Petrie  (Mr Cooke)  who has just spoken, could not give a hang about prices and incomes, but they want to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the national anthem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He even criticised the honourable member for Petrie  (Mr Cooke)  and the mover of the motion, the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar),  on the ground that they said that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> would need to be taken of all Australians including people in aged persons homes, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All I suggest to people who may be fortunate enough to get a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is that they do not ignore it but write in ‘the present national anthem’ and at the same time abide by the rest of the voting instructions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would think that one of the very good arguments that would persuade the people of Australia to <span class="highlight">vote</span> ‘Yes, Yes’ on Saturday would be the knowledge that, if we had this sort of control, there would be regulation of doctors fees, medical fees generally, legal fees and other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has accepted the present system in Queensland, and the <span class="highlight">vote</span> achieved by the Labor Government in Queensland at the last Federal election, when one of the election issues was health, indicated that the people of Queensland will not have a bar of this scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not often that one hears of a person coming from Queensland complaining about the finest State in Australia, the best governed State in Australia, a State which has a Government which has been returned constantly and a State in which the percentage of the Labor <span class="highlight">vote</span> fell at the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ever since they have asserted this principle and have promised at every election that they would not reverse it, they have maintained power, albeit on a minority <span class="highlight">vote</span>, in the Queensland Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What ought to be observed is that, if one take the great metropolitan areas of Sydney and Melbourne which between them contain fairly close to half the population of Australia, there was a majority Yes <span class="highlight">vote</span> for something to be done about prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Merely to say that because 51 per cent of the people <span class="highlight">vote</span> one way and 49 per cent <span class="highlight">vote</span> the other, that is a decisive answer seems to me to beg the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can assure honourable members that this Commission - this costly Commission - in support of which we are expected to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, with all the expertise that the Minister may hope to gather, will not be able to achieve a percentage cover of our population anywhere near 100 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever has been the outcome of the negotiations that have gone on, however the members of the Country Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> tonight, I assert that they will stand by the principle that every child should attract to itself as a matter of right and of equity and of justice a per capita payment for education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime, every member of my Party thoroughly accepts the principle upon which we have stood until now and on which we will stand tonight and <span class="highlight">vote</span> according to our principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are some of theleading economists in Australia, and their international reputations would far outrank the reputations of the other economists who recommended a ‘yes’ <span class="highlight">vote</span> and on whom the Prime Minister relied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, let me say that the Prime Minister misled the House absolutely when he said that all academic economists supported a ‘yes’ <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, when he was proved wrong and when the man he had quoted, Professor Parkin, advocated a ‘no’ <span class="highlight">vote</span>, the Prime Minister went to the lengths of describing these professional people as second raters and third raters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister, for his own base political purposes, in an endeavour to mislead the people of Australia, told them something that was untrue, namely, that every academic economist supported a ‘yes’ <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was an endeavour, at the last moment, on the day before the referendum <span class="highlight">vote</span>, to deceive the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By a very decided and almost unprecedented <span class="highlight">vote</span> in every State in Australia they called the Government to task; they said that they did not trust the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister the following question: Is it correct as reported that he was refused a <span class="highlight">vote</span> by the returning officer at a polling booth on Saturday because, apparently unbeknown to the Prime Minister one of his staff had arranged a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> for him? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the voter himself must sign the application for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> before a witness and must himself fill in the ballot paper, I ask the Prime Minister: Did he in fact sign the application for a postal vole and did he in fact mi in the postal ballot paper? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he did, why would he have endeavoured to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the polling booth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did sign an application for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> just in case I was not able to be in my electorate on polling day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps I may add that in my electorate, owing to the malapportionment imposed by the dilatoriness of our predecessors and the deficiencies of the electoral laws, my <span class="highlight">vote</span> in any case would be worth only half as much as that of most people in the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every motion which a private member has put on general business has been debated and it has come to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In discussing this allegation with  Mr Hastings  it was learnt that any applications for -a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> received after 6 p.m. on the day before the election, i.e. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, in relation to specific complaints by residents in the electorate who applied for postal votes and didn’t receive ballot papers, I quote the following example: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The applications were received by the Returning Officer on 16.11.73 and the postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> ballot papers are claimed to have been posted to the applicants on the same day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-64">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been told by a number of postmen that they did not have the opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They just did not get a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am saying that whoever told him that the postmen were given the opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> misled him because all of them did not get a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The postmen suggested to me that he made the rules, on which they did not receive a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fair enough, but what should the people be allowed to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-23-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sure, we have not been allowed to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-23-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But - and this is much more important - we know that some of the Bills are a mixture of good and bad, and the good has been put in in order to disguise the bad and to deceive the people who will come to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in these referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-23-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not allowing a separate <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the good and the bad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-23-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer is, quite frankly, that the people should have an opportunity of telling the good from the bad and of being able to <span class="highlight">vote</span> separately on the separate features, instead of having them lumped together in a way which the Government has decided arbitrarily and which it is not going to give this House an opportunity of debating or considering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-23-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he wants to show his strength of purpose and character and his influence as  President  of the State branch of the ALP in Victoria, and if he is prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this Bill, then he should say to the Prime Minister: T want this; I want simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member is not prepared to do that, he should not be prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the extraordinary convolution of logic that he will apply to this matter, he will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this Bill, that is to say, he wants simultaneous elections, but then he will sit back meekly and mildly and not insist on an election for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The next Bill in this quartet of Bills is one which has the euphemistic title, which is what the electors will read when they go to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this referendum, of a Bill for an Act: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about this wonderful democratic principle that everyone over 18 years of age will have a <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Can anyone tell me the person in Australia today who is over 18 who does not have the <span class="highlight">vote</span> unless he is disqualified for reasons such as being in gaol or of unsound mind or something of that kind? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government wants to go to the people with a referendum proposal to provide a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for persons over 18 years, to distribute boundaries on the basis of people instead of on the basis of electors and to take away any possibility of distributing electorates on the basis of community of interest, distance and the whole geography of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it would provide that the electors of all the territories should have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has to oppose the whole proposal because the single question to be put to the people is:   to facilitate alterations to the Constitution and to allow Electors in Territories, as well as Electors in the States, to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at Referendums on Proposed Laws to alter the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A government led by the Country Party in Queensland governs with approximately 19 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>, yet the Liberal Party which in fact received a greater percentage of the votes but fewer seats cannot govern the State because of the gerrymander. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Normally, simple arithmetic shows that the procedure is that a government needs at least 51 per cent of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Other parties make up the remainder of the votes but have not got the majority of seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The astonishing thing is that what is being put to the Australian people now is a proposal that takes us much further away from Labor’s long held principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value than we have been, or would have been under the Government’s proposals in the Commonwealth Electoral Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can have some sympathy for the Labor Party’s traditional espousal of the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value even though one cannot excuse the Labor Party’s utter lack of understanding of the reasons why this theoretical principle cannot be applied with justice in a country like Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But one cannot, no matter how hard one tries, find any reason to sympathise with the Labor Party’s efforts now to change the electoral system in a way that completely ignores one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We therefore recommend that the Australian people <span class="highlight">vote</span> firmly ‘no’ on this question of involving the Commonwealth in local government affairs, as we recommend a no’ <span class="highlight">vote</span> to the other 3 questions that are before the House at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Neither would ‘I if I were he because when I look at the votes received by the honourable member for McMillan  (Mr Hewson)  I see that he got in with only 17 per cent of the primary <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should the Country Party want to change the system when in Queensland, with 19 per cent of the votes, not only is it beating the votes of the Liberal Party but it also has a member who could not obtain one-fifth of the votes and yet is Premier of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why would members of the Country Party want to change a system that can give them a Premier with 19 per cent of the votes of the people of Queensland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why change a system which enabled the honourable member for McMillan - not a very good member - to get here on 17 per cent of the primary votes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind him that all the Labor Party seeks to do with any legislation affecting electoral boundaries or any other electoral matter is to see that the Party that gets the majority of the votes gets the majority of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For my part I favour optional preferential voting whereby a person can <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the number of candidates required to fill the vacancies or all candidates according to his desires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to those honourable members who sit opposite that it is time in Australia that systems were devised whereby the majority <span class="highlight">vote</span> elected the majority of members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one has regard to their performance and to their approach one must realise that they could not win a majority of the votes because the majority of people are more sensible than to elect Country Party members because they know they are the types of people who are elected only because boundaries are gerrymandered and rigged to their advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The papers and records show that it is a minority party of minority votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We propose that a referendum be carried if a majority of voters in not less than one half rather than more than one half of the States <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of a proposed change to the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second proposal is that electors in the A.C.T., including Jervis Bay, and the Northern Territory be given the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at constitutional referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All parties agree that the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at constitutional referendums should be extended to citizens of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have for too long been denied the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on matters which affect them as much as any other citizens of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to that, we on this side of the Parliament seek by these proposals to let the people decide - to have their <span class="highlight">vote</span> on whether their Constitution should change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask all those honourable members opposite who do not trust the Australian people and say that they should not be given a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on these great democratic proposals to stand and be counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This of course denies the very proposition of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Constitution Alteration (Mode of Altering the Constitution) Bill seeks to change the present requirement that, before a referendum can succeed, a majority of the electors in a majority of the States must <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of the proposal; that is, there must be a majority of electors in four of the six States and also a majority of all electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill contains a subsidiary proposal which would enable electors in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referenda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Leader of the House that a referendum was held on 8 December when a No-No <span class="highlight">vote</span> was given in the most unmistakable terms by the people by which they denied to the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  his desire for the aggrandisement of Commonwealth power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us who attended at polling booths on that day know that not only Liberal and Country Party supporters voted no, but also that many Labor Party supporters voted no. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of those whom I know voted for my Labor Party opponent at the 1972 election voted clearly and unmistakably for a No-No <span class="highlight">vote</span> in that referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the second reading of the first of these Bills will be put at 3.30 p.m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are Bills upon which the people have to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of this it is important that the details should be right, that the <span class="highlight">vote</span> should be fair and that the people should know exactly what they are voting on, instead of being presented with the hotch potch that the Government is putting forward deliberately to cover up its real motives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one did not respect the Prime Minister’s integrity one might even say that it is fraudulent to go to the people and try to persuade them to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a Bill which the Government knows is but the first step towards achieving its objective of annihilating the Senate and reducing government in Australia simply to government by decree, which is what would happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am sure that when the numbers go up on the polling day when this referendum is submitted there will be a resounding ‘No’ <span class="highlight">vote</span> in every State in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> which has just been taken is relevant to this debate because it shows that numbers remain of some importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will remember - I am certain the public, aldermen and councillors throughout the nation will remember - that in November 1972 in my policy speech on behalf of the Government Party I undertook that we would seek to have a voice and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for local government on the Loan Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal was spelt out to entail the councillors in each State electing a person to speak and <span class="highlight">vote</span> on their behalf on the Loan Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to clause 2 naturally enough I would support paragraph (a) which would give the territorians the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a referen dum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  had been really fair dinkum about giving territorians the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a referendum, he would not have had included in this clause paragraph (c) which virtually calls for the rejection of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister is genuine and if there is to be any genuineness at all about the Australian Labor Party’s wish to give territorians the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a referendum - let us face it, it should be soparagraph (a) should not be coupled with paragraph (c). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am certain that there is a way that territorians can have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums without coupling that provision to something which most assuredly will ensure that the Bill is thrown out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But my <span class="highlight">vote</span>, of course, will be shown as being against the Bill as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  was one of those - not the only one and not the first one - to suggest that in referendums on matters concerning the alteration of the Constitution electors in the Territories, namely, the Northern Territory and the Capital Territory, should be given a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is possible that the electors in the Territories could have an amendment of the Constitution foisted on them which would not have been carried by a majority of all the electors in Australia because if the Territory electors had had a <span class="highlight">vote</span> their votes would have countervailed a majority of the electors in the whole of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fair that electors in the Territories should have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on questions concerning the alteration of the Constitution since they are bound by the provisions of the Constitution whether they have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> upon it or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is simple democracy that they should have a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last time an amendment was produced by a government of another political complexion in 1967 - the Aboriginal referendum - there were suggestions that the Constitution should be altered at the same time to give votes at referendums to electors of the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if a clear majority of the electors who <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a referendum are in favour of a proposed law, their will should not be frustrated because separate majorities of electors have not been obtained in a majority of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposal seeks to lay the way for a provision that if a majority of electors and three of the 6 States <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour that is sufficient to carry a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that it has been very patient indeed in leaving it now, 15 or 16 years later, to allow the people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other proposal that this referendum Bill makes is that people in the Territories - there would be now be about 140,000 electors in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory - should be allowed to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on amendments to the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, they have been denied a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on constitutional amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is that people in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory should also be able to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on amendments of the Constitution; they should be able to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referendums to alter the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their votes ought to be counted in determining whether there is a majority of the electors voting in the whole of Australia in favour of the referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It said: if a clear majority of the electors who <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a referendum are in favour of a proposed law, their will should not be frustrated because separate majorities of electors have not been obtained in a majority of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For every State in which there is an adverse <span class="highlight">vote</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, the blue sheet which was circulated before lunch today set out very clearly the times at which the votes were to be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I believe there was no excuse for any member, from either the Government side or the Opposition side, not being here for the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, I point to the voting figures in the division in question, which were 57 votes for the Government and 51 votes for the Opposition - indicating that in view of the fact that the Government had 67 members in attendance or, allowing for yourself  Mr Speaker,  66 votes, 9 Government members missed the division hut only 3 Opposition members missed it, as we had 3 members away due to their own illness or illness in the family and our Leader, the right honourable member for Bruce  (Mr Snedden),  did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> at any time today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 3 arguments of the Minister for Secondary Industry were: Firstly, that as a result of consultation with the States, this fifth of the guillotined constitutional amendment Bills has been presented to this Parliament for urgent passage so that the Australian people can take a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances the people ought to be allowed to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the <span class="highlight">vote</span> taken earlier this day on the third reading of the Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill 1974 being rescinded and the question for the third reading of the Bill being again put to the House forthwith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the chief Opposition Whip, the honourable member ‘for Henty  (Mr Fox),  pointed out earlier in the day, 3 Opposition members were away because of illness and the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> on any of these Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore 3 Opposition members and 9 Government members failed to reach the House in time to <span class="highlight">vote</span> before the doors closed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were 66 Government members and 54 Opposition members who could have voted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that when the people of this country are required, as they may well be, to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on these constitutional amendments they will take note of the manner in which the Government has forced the legislation through the House, or sought to do so, but was so unable to direct the proceedings of the House that it could not front up to a debate at the required time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am willing to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for that suspension and I shall do so in a moment but I am not clear in my mind as to what the legal consequence of this may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that we will not be entitled to put the Bill to a referendum, even though we have voted in the House to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though we suspend Standing Orders - I am going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for that suspension in a moment - it may be that the referendum itself would be illegal and open to challenge in the High Court of Australia because of the specific nature of Standing Order 263 which already has had its effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the suspension with those reservations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the <span class="highlight">vote</span> taken earlier this day on the third reading of the Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill 1974 be rescinded and that the question ‘That the Bill be now read a third time’ be again put to the House forthwith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that if a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> were taken on that issue there would be fairly common agreement that that is a reasonable hour to finish to enable those who have responsibilities to carry them out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every motion which was put forward on private members’ day last year during the last session day was debated and taken to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Rather I believe that he should interpret and listen to the statistics that my colleague quoted to show the number of occasions, and the frequency of the occasions, on which the Leader of the House has found it necessary to guillotine, gag, suspend or accelerate debate so that the legislation could be thrust over to the other place, as the Constitution Alteration Bills were only yesterday, so that the other House could have an adequate time to analyse the Bills in detail and present a considered judgment on them when it came to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are asking for greater time to discuss and debate legislation in the House and are proposing to <span class="highlight">vote</span> to reduce the amount of time which will be available for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Frequently in this House the Minister for Services and Property has referred to the question of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My interpretation of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value is that the people in the various electorates have the right to contact their local member of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I also remember on that occasion - the right honourable member for Lowe  (Mr McMahon)  was Prime Minister - it was alleged by all the parties that there was a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There certainly was a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> by Australian Labor Party members but I well remember about 2 or 3 members of the Cabinet - I do not think they were prominent members, but they were Ministers at the time - who sat themselves down amongst those of us who were voting in a particular way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken on the very issue we are now talking about, namely, curtailing the hours of the House so that we would not sit into the early hours of the morning when we have had the spectacle of members lying underneath their bench because they were exhausted, and having to be propped up when a division was taken so that the tellers could see them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also commend him on the proposition which he has placed before honourable members today and I urge honourable members to <span class="highlight">vote</span> solidly in favour of it because I have heard no valid argument today to the contrary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, this business has been brought to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Hardly one matter worth mentioning was ever discussed in regard to general business and certainly nothing was ever brought to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the present Government at least they are assured that general business matters will be brought to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is of no use coming in here and talking about general business matters and then not being prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One member of the Government parties during the last Parliament brought up a general business matter, thundered about it with all the wrath that he could command, then walked over to the other side of the House and voted against enabling his motion being voted upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a member wants to put up a motion he should be prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is giving the Opposition the opportunity and the responsibility of working out whether it is prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on some of the motions that come forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said there would be one debate and one <span class="highlight">vote</span> on these particular matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The lowest and the newest backbencher has a <span class="highlight">vote</span> equal to that of the Prime Minister when matters are discussed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  chairman  says: ‘The policy of this company is to <span class="highlight">vote</span> Lib. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I applied for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the State elections, as did my wife. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So they made quite sure that we would not be able to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the State elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, they sent the papers too late; secondly, they sent us ballot papers for an electorate in which we were not entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and, thirdly, they sent envelopes directing that the ballot papers be returned to an electorate which had no connection either with the electorate in which we were enrolled or the electorate for which we received ballot papers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is no wonder that there is now a case before the Court of Disputed Returns on the question of Coogee where a Labor candidate was allegdly defeated by 8 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> applications in other electoral districts were dealt with in the same fashion as my own postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> application it is not surprising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the projected legislation dealing with the registration of political parties and, just as importantly the forthcoming Senate election, it is necessary for the people to know precisely the parties contesting elections in order that they may avoid in many ways informal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware that certain changes have been made to the names of some parties, I think it is only fair that the people should know the situation, in order that they may <span class="highlight">vote</span> inteligently and in view of the registration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I ask the city dwellers to make sure that they <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the National Party, and the country dwellers to make sure that they <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the National Alliance because it is important that confusion does not force them to make what might be termed informal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the people should be aware that when they <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the National Alliance they <span class="highlight">vote</span> for 2 parties and, in effect they have struck the jackpot - 2 votes for one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately there is great confusion amongst voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope this explanation will avoid people casting a false <span class="highlight">vote</span> and, in effect, will avoid people casting informal votes at the forthcoming Senate election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Presumably, even though many farmers still <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Australian Country Party, they are a little better educated in the use of superphosphate in 1974 than they were in 1934. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Far from ensuring the promised successful restoration of strong highly professional all volunteer armed forces in fact the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the first Whitlam Budget has been reduced to 2.9 per cent of gross national product - not the 3.3 per cent or 3.2 per cent promised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But why did not the Government give the people an opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on whether they wanted a new national anthem? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>If this is to be contemplated I hope that the people will be given a chance to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition, instead of facilitating such a referendum as one might have hoped, instead of letting the Australian people have a free choice and a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the subject of whether they wanted in effect a 2-tier federalism or a 3-tier federalism, opposed at every stage the Bill we brought in to make the referendum possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1947 in Queensland Labor polled slightly less than 43 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span> but won 35 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same year the United Australia Party-Country Party polled 44.26 per cent of the votes yet won only 23 seats  -  2 per cent more than Labor polled but 12 fewer seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1950 Labor won 46.3 per cent of the votes and 42 seats, the Liberal-Country Party 48 per cent or 2 per cent more than Labor but 31 seats  -  11 seats fewer than the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will fix the electorate so that you get one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It talks about the Country Party gaining 19 per cent or a little more than that of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course what they do not say is that that was the percentage of the total votes cast in all Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A very different result would be obtained if the Country Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> were quoted as a percentage of votes obtained in electorates where it fields candidates and then compared with the percentage that the Labor Party gains in seats where it fields candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must consider the combined <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Country Party and its colleague, the Liberal Party, to get some assessment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mention was made earlier of gerrymanders and a lot was said about the position in Queensland under a Labor Government when a gerrymander took place and Labor governed with something less than half the total <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There will be a gorgeous alliance with people like the Premier of Queensland who sits in judgment on others, calls his State a sovereign State - nobody has yet explained to me what that expression means - and holds sway on something less than 19 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member who told us what was happening in Queensland under a Labor government forgot to say that the Playford Liberal Government of South Australia had been in government in that State for 25 years on 32 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even today we do not have a Labor government in Victoria because the ruling Liberal Party is governing that State on about 42 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the people of Australia would be asked a question during the referendum, not just the 19 per cent who <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the very strategically placed electorates in Queensland to perpetuate the archaic Country Party Government in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>prevent various franchises from being introduced which restrict or deny the majority pf voters the opportunity to participate in elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where Labor governments have control this is not possible, because the Upper House in each of the States where there are Labor governments at present at least are so structured that conservative majorities are guaranteed irrespective of what way the people <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a situation in Western Australia, for instance, where in one Upper House electorate there are 85,000 electors and in another electorate there are 5,400 electors, a difference which represents an effective 15 votes for an elector in one electorate compared with one <span class="highlight">vote</span> for an elector in another electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can rationalise that in any way one likes by using percentages, but the facts are that if the system is to be democratic every person who is above the age at which a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is allowed and is an Australian citizen or a British subject is entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and any diminution of that right to have a full <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the election of a parliament is a denial of democratic principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, I refer to a remark made by the honourable member for Curtin  (Mr Garland)  when he was discussing the reduction made by the United States Congress in that country’s foreign aid <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this attack on my colleague was somewhat unjustified because we should remember that the reduction made by the United States Congress in that country’s foreign aid <span class="highlight">vote</span> - I agree with my colleague that this is an utter tragedy for the lesser developed countries - was made against the wishes of the Nixon Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  speech makes it quite clear that he believes that the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> should be increased by one per cent of the gross national product. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In South Australia at the moment - and this system is about to be abolished - there is an upper House in which the party that has 56 per cent of the votes in the lower House can get only 4 to 6 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet this party has received an average of 53 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Labor Party in that State which at almost every election receives better than 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is able to elect 2 out of 19 Legislative Councillors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party with about 40 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is able to elect an absolute majority of Legislative Councillors to the upper House in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The combined parties in opposition - and there the Country Party is just a little more enlightened than it is in this Parliament because in Victoria it is sometimes seen to be in opposition - which receive something approaching 60 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span> are able to elect about one-third of the members of the upper House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be that a system of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value or electorates of equal population is not as ideal as one could devise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australian  Capital Territory and the Northern Territory to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums on proposed laws to alter the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that honourable members opposite will deny to electors in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the people in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are citizens and are entitled to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman will realise that the proposal envisages the full participation by members of Parliament in the discussion of matters upon which the Parliament will later have to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not for me to indicate whether I think the <span class="highlight">vote</span> should be successful or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose this would be one, because this is one area where the Liberal Party was left by itself when the Country Party crossed the floor to <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Government on education grants legislation and the Schools Commission Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker,  it had been alleged that I had voted in a certain way in which I did not <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides that all members of the Commission be entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course we have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> at our Party meetings, but we do not have such a collection of people, groups and committees trying to determine where we go when we are in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Hall Government introduced a system which, although it was not perfect, did move a bit towards being a fairer system in that the average city electorate finished up with 14,000 voters and the average country electorate with about 9,000 voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should see a redistribution being brought about in South Australia shortly because at present there are around 27,000 voters in some of the city electorates in South Australia and 9,000 in some of the country electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years it appeared that the Labor Party, although polling 52 per cent to 54 per cent of the popular <span class="highlight">vote</span> in South Australia, could hold only 20 per cent of the seats, in the Legislative Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Eden-Monaro  (Mr Whan)  had the temerity to move a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of censure against the Australian Country Party - the Party of great responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the continuing senators fourteen belong to the Labor Party; there are 2 independent senators -  Senator Negus  and  Senator Townley  - and in examining the results of the division in the Senate in the past year I see that  Senator Negus  almost always votes with the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would be 15 Labor Party senators and only one more needed to swing the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the Opposition has done is to refuse to <span class="highlight">vote</span> to repeal our 1972 legislation establishing per capita grants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In quite a non-political way, to assist honourable members opposite in their hour of need and to avoid the confusion that exists between the trendy and the non-trendy Liberals, the Country Party Alliance, the National Alliance and the National Country Party, I suggest that the best way to make a formal <span class="highlight">vote</span> in any following election is to <span class="highlight">vote</span> No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have to make a judgment whether they are going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for or against these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is nonsense and the House showed by its <span class="highlight">vote</span> that it knew it to be nonsense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> was six all and Councillor Dallimore had the pleasure of saying that he was not going to be controlled by Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he has any integrity in this matter and opposes it I invite him to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the Prime Minister, by these unworthy manoeuvres, will be able to affect the number of continuing senators in the Senate the people of Australia will not have a chance of making their <span class="highlight">vote</span> fully effective in the Senate because the people of Queensland will be virtually disenfranchised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If contested, a <span class="highlight">vote</span> with over 90 per cent for one side is probably meaningless, while majorities over 70 per cent seem suspicious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill proposes to increase the membership of the Commission from seven to nine and to give the 2 non-voting members the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But just increasing the number of people on the Commission and giving them a <span class="highlight">vote</span> does not necessarily make the Commission more effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need to increase the number of members of the Australian Tourist Commission and to allow all members to <span class="highlight">vote</span> is appreciated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years now we have heard from members of the Opposition as they then were but who are now members of the Government that the important principle in any democratic situation should be the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>-one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one side it has produced a plea for the implementation of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>-one value but on the other it has run right away from this principle by bringing forward a proposal for boundary redistributions to be based on population and not on voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what is certainly so is that the Government has run right away from the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>-one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the way boundaries will be drawn under these proposals which stupidly enough are labelled a ‘referendum for democratic elections’ one will find that the result will be biased away from the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>- one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, there is a double bias on the one hand weighted against a bias in the other direction all of which is working against the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>-one value that so many members on the Government side have espoused for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is running away from its self-professed principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>-one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But roughly speaking, the National Alliance Party received 10 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Western Australia, the Australian Labor Party received 48.5 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and the Liberal Party received 41 per cent or thereabouts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government put forward a proposition that would outlaw gerrymanders and enshrine in the Constitution, if the people approved of it, the principle of one man one <span class="highlight">vote</span> and the principle that electorates should Le as near as practicable equal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is entitled to say that it does not believe in electorates being as nearly as practicable equal, it is entitled to say that it does not believe in the principle of one man one <span class="highlight">vote</span> - and obviously by its actions it does not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Its whole electoral system rests on the principle of one man one <span class="highlight">vote</span> not being so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Minister for Secondary Industry and his gaggle of colleagues who represent the so-called Cabinet of this country are prepared to make loose allegations as to the success of their policies so far, let them face the music, let them go to a general election so that the people of this country will have an opportunity to record their <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and to reject the discredited nature of the present administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We hope they will be debated in another place before the coming elections and we hope that honourable members will see that this is one of the issues which must be discussed not only in this Parliament but also before the Australian people whenever they are allowed to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let the Opposition <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the legislation, as we know in advance it will, so that we can send it to the Senate where it can be added to the long list of Bills that either have been rejected outright by the Senate or have been so emasculated as to render them inoperative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is significant that almost immediately after the public announcement that the Labor Government had endorsed proposals for the public disclosure of campaign funds, the Liberal Party announced that it would <span class="highlight">vote</span> against Supply in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The possibility that the people of Western Australia may be required to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the House of Representatives earlier than the Distribution Commissioners may have expected has, in the Government’s view, simply given additional urgency to the need for action in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister who is responsible to the Parliament for this particular area - in spite of the fact that the Commissioners enjoy an independent position and have come to their conclusions and recommendations independently - mentioned in his opening remarks the possibility that the people of Western Australia may be required to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the House of Representatives earlier than the Distribution Commissioners may have expected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Minister did not use the phrase which is bandied around on this question - one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value - it is an emotive phrase which certainly has been used in debates like this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year the Government introduced a Bill to reduce that to 10 per cent on the argument that it provided for one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think one can question that principle because, after all, if one has a 10 per cent variation rather than a 20 per cent variation that hardly gives a result closer to one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly the term ‘one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value’ has no precise meaning, lt is jargon which is wheeled out to raise to the surface the proper ideals that people have for a more democratic system, to gain . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have been quite happy, adopting the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, for my electorate to have a greater number of electors and to have carried the lot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no doubt that the electorate of Kalgoorlie will remain a Labor seat and the people of Kalgoorlie will continue to <span class="highlight">vote</span> very strongly in favour of Labor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no way in the world that the elusive concept of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value can be achieved unless there is a redistribution the day after a census and an election the next day or very closely to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Labor Party liked to complain - I am not making this complaint - it could say that when the electorate of Kambalda, which had a Labor majority, was put into Boulder-Dundas, which already had a large Labor majority, to make an inflated majority wasting Labor votes, the altering of the boundary could be called a gerrymander. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During a debate in South Australia in the days when the Liberal and Country League was the Government on 35.5 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and the Australian Labor Party was the Opposition on 53 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> a letter appeared in the newspapers asking why a metropolitan drink waiter should have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the same value as a pioneer settler in the country, une could equally ask why a country drink waiter m Western Australia should have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> that is 14.5 tunes the value  01  the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of a city drink waiter or why a country drink waiter should have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> that is 14.5 times the value of a city brain surgeon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the honourable member that the Australian Labor Party received 53 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the metropolitan area and that the Liberal Party of Australia was battling to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>get 40 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If 48.8 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the State election in Western Australia is a sign of no confidence in Labor, may I ask what 10 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the National Alliance is? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the National Alliance received a line up of very small seats with its 10 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be very happy to see reproduced in Western Australia in the election for both the Senate and the House of Representatives the <span class="highlight">vote</span> that took place at the recent State election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, 1 did not come down in the last political shower and I know that people do not necessarily <span class="highlight">vote</span> the same way in State and Federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not care what result is derived from an election as long as it is indicative of the way the people voted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What does disturb me are the situations that one can get where one has an ultraweighting of votes so that the electoral result is not in truth the way in which the people voted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why it is a perfectly respectable argument to advance that there should be a policy of one man one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that no member of this House could, in all con science, <span class="highlight">vote</span> against such a fair and reasonable proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these days when people talk about one man one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one sees how that ideal is certainly not achieved in a comparison of this sort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is because all over this country today Liberal and Country Party organisers - the bigwigs of business and industry - are standing over members of the Country Party and the Liberal side in another place seeking to get their <span class="highlight">vote</span> to stop supply and to defeat this duly elected Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not see why those who are trying to influence Liberals to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against their consciences should be speeded up in their activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us see that we relieve those conscience stricken senators of their worry and strife and give them the opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on other issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, the Opposition Parties will be forced to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against both Bills, as in fact we did last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now up to the Opposition to decide whether it will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against these Bills, as it is up to the Opposition to decide whether it will deny supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>–In reply to the points made by the Minister for Overseas Trade  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  let me say that there is no doubt or hesitation by the Opposition that it will certainly <span class="highlight">vote</span> against these Bills and against the Appropriation Bills, as I am sure the Minister knows full well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly there is great reluctance to invoke the power the Senate has to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against Supply - to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against an Appropriation Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the Prime Minister knew that he could not gain control of the Senate by democratic means - by the popular <span class="highlight">vote</span> of all the people of Australia - he sought to buy a House of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is the man who was so united with the Australian Country Party, his colleagues in opposition, that the Country Party members crossed the floor to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So strong was the bond that they had to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on opposite sides of the House and record their names in Hansard ashaving done so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the system Ministers sit in and are responsible to Parliament; the Cabinet may be displaced by a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the House of Representatives (not - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before they were put to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> the Minister made a threat to the Opposition that the rejection of these Bills would cause a double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can the people of Australia trust or <span class="highlight">vote</span> for such a Government when such a senior minister adopts this attitude to Parliament and to the people generally? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be surprised if it added 2 per cent to the proportion of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> spent on equipment, a proportion that under this Government has dropped to a disastrous all-time low of 8 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Country Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> one way in this House and another way in the other on such matters as devaluation and rural assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If you do not want abortion, <span class="highlight">vote</span> for Hannan; if you want abortion <span class="highlight">vote</span> for Snedden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The education <span class="highlight">vote</span> has been doubled and in every way, right throughout this country, tremendous prosperity has been brought to Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When Labor faces the people in the immediate future after those frightened men opposite have brought themselves to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this Supply Bill, I ask the Australian people to return the Whitlam Government because it has brought to this country things that the people desire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this occasion, I ask the people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against a Senate that refused to face the people itself and yet seeks to force this House to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What particular taxes would be cut and for whom, and where would the vast cuts in public expenditure take place, particularly when they seem to be committed to increasing one level of Government expenditure, that is, the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The general saving to the defence forces excess capacity <span class="highlight">vote</span> is very considerable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Out of which appropriation <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Budget last year is this additional money to come? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I would hope that we can revive the report and that the Houses can <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the recommendations of the Committee when the Parliament reconvenes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that the Parliament will <span class="highlight">vote</span> on our recommendations and I would hope that this would be a nonparty <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Western Australian Government has a ‘Compulsory Baiting Scheme’, which can be applied following a 60 per cent affirmative <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a poll held in any district. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-42-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having regard to the massive sense of impartiality that pervades the Government side, I am quite sure that a number of honourable members on that side will join the Opposition when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The changes proposed by this Bill are designed to provide, by legislative measures that, as far as may be practicable, the value of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of one citizen shall be equivalent to the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of another and to give some meaningful application to the principle of ‘one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value’ without unnecessarily restricting the distribution commissioners in proposing a redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were designed to encourage departure from the quota of electors in a manner which dilutes the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in metropolitan areas and weights it in favour of rural areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We seek only to introduce and perpetuate, as far as possible, the principle of ‘one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value’ and to ensure that the result of an election will reflect the opinion of the majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both Bills were taken to the second reading stage but no <span class="highlight">vote</span> on either Bill was allowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to look at some of the other Western countries where, even if they claim to adhere to the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value there are still large differences in enrolment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what they consider one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe there is a principle of equal, if not greater importance than the mechanical theoretical principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, and that is the principle of equality of representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is impossible under the strict application of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value is a very high sounding principle but in practice it brings undemocratic results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past we have heard members of the Australian Labor Party - the Don Dunstans and the people who have done a good job - say: ‘We believe in one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has cast aside the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value and is trying to introduce a system based on one person one <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is not the same thing as the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor’s Party’s principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value has been cast aside today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What happened to the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value in that case? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What will happen to the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value that the Labor Party espoused? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The very practice of allowing a 20 per cent variation has on past performance encouraged the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until such time as the people of Australia by a clear <span class="highlight">vote</span> say ‘We wish to alter the Constitution’ we should respect its terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Tonight they are hiding by saying silently ‘No’ in this Parliament and then going outside the Parliament and saying that they voted for it - all to protect the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder),  who everybody knows is living on borrowed time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet its members are not game to line up here tonight and <span class="highlight">vote</span> for them because they say they want to save time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Country Party here today says one thing, but in another place it is likely to <span class="highlight">vote</span> the other way round. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On that occasion, for once, they recorded an intelligent <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and I think they have been ashamed of it ever since because they have never divided the House on this issue since. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will say that it is not prepared to divide the Parliament, not because it wants to save time but because it wants to tell the people that it voted for this measure without having the courage to front up and put its <span class="highlight">vote</span> where it believes it should be, and that is in the interests of the people of these districts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite interesting that we have just completed a debate in which the honourable member for Hunter, who interjected, suggested that one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value is a precept which he upholds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand he seeks an equal voice and one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value and ail of those nonsensical principles that do not work out in practice, and on the other hand he acknowledges that he is not prepared to give full and adequate Senate representative voice in the Senate to the 2 representatives of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is going to do it on a basis not of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value but in a way which will erode the voice of those 10 senators from his own State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was the Labor Party I believe which first introduced the provision whereby the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory could be represented in this chamber, but it did not give those representatives a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The last time such a motion was moved and we had a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this House the Opposition raked up 53 members because the rest of them had gone home to bed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it will not dawn on the Leader of the Opposition that that is the case he can be shown only when he puts up motions like this and they are defeated by the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the majority elected by the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many new members of this Parliament who have just arrived and who have no fixed ideas on these matters were not given an opportunity to express their viewpoints and to hear others and yet had to <span class="highlight">vote</span> one way or the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate adjourned debate by <span class="highlight">vote</span> on division until after 1 August 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I must commend him, too, for his similar action on many occasions when he has had the courage to defy the rulings given in his own Party room and has moved across the floor to <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then there is that really meaningless but <span class="highlight">vote</span> catching phrase ‘more equal opportunities for all Australians’ - a sprat to catch an electoral mackerel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That in matters of procedure the  Chairman  or  Deputy Chairman  presiding at the meeting have a deliberative <span class="highlight">vote</span> and, in the event of an equality of voting, have a casting <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and that, in other matters, the  Chairman  or  Deputy Chairman  have a deliberative <span class="highlight">vote</span> only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On Friday there was another meeting which was attended by four times as many people as attended the earlier meeting  -  1,200 were present compared with 300 on the previous occasion - and the <span class="highlight">vote</span> to stick with the agreement was unanimous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the other problems we have to consider is whether we are to have one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is no good the honourable member for the Northern Territory saying, as a member of this House, that he is in favour of giving the people of the Northern Territory a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Senate when his Party is opposed to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  has given notice of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of censure of the Government in relation to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro but his supporters are going crook because we will not debate it a week earlier than he wants to debate it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But if I thought for one moment - I say this to my friend the Minister for Manufacturing Industry, who is in charge of the Bill - that this Bill would in fact encourage a proper priority for national consciousness I would support it with my voice, with my <span class="highlight">vote</span> and with my commitment My colleagues on both sides of the House would know that that is no idle declaration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Provision will be made that before an amalgamation can be finally registered there will need to be a ballot of all the members of both organisations or, if there are more than 2 organisations, of all of the organisations involved; but it will not be necessary to hold up an amalgamation merely because less than 50 per cent of the members eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span> failed to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Act will require that every member of every organisation affected by the amalgamation shall be supplied with a ballot paper and given the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But those who choose to exercise the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be able to decide by a majority of their number whether the registration of the amalgamation is to be consummated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Shipwrights Union, with less than 5 per cent of the total membership of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, sought to amalgamate with the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union although it would be compulsory for all the members of the Shipwrights Union to be given the opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, the Registrar would be able to say, upon application from the AMWU, that he considered that the sort of work that the shipwrights were doing was so similar to and so much like the work that the AMWU members were doing that there was no need to have a ballot of the members of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It moved from being a body in which there was a dominance of official appointees to a body on which 3 non-official appointees held the balance of power, and to the present Council of 17 members, 11 elected by <span class="highlight">vote</span> and 6 public servant appointees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are to ensure that people in isolated areas, particularly itinerant Aborigines, will have the opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As it happened, a couple of Country Party members of the Council indicated their intention to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet pressure was applied by the Leader of the Country Party in Canberra to try to persuade those members by the Country Party in the Legislative Council to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I was saying, the true test of the sincerity of a member of Parliament is how he votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I close the debate we will watch with interest to see who, on the other side of the House, calls for a division and we will watch with interest to see which way the honourable member for the Northern Territory votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is almost inconceivable that members of a Government Party, charged with the clear obligation to develop an effective anti-inflation policy, could have been prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a 38 per cent increase in their own salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the Opposition went out to the country and asked the people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> ‘No’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He pointed out that  Senator Brown  had been incorrect about when Aborigines got the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Brown  had said that if it had not been for Labor Party pressure Aborigines would not have had the <span class="highlight">vote</span> a few years ago when they did receive it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Brown  replied by saying: ‘Look, if Aborigines had a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in 1908 I will give SI, 000 to any charity you like to name. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He rang me from Bairnsdale the next morning and I said: T am sure they had a <span class="highlight">vote</span> a long time ago but I am not sure of the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1855 Aborigines got the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Victoria so  Senator Brown  was a little bit out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have confirmed that Aborigines have had the <span class="highlight">vote</span> since 1855 in the State of Victoria and logically from 1901 for Federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Governments will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> sufficient funds in this highly generalised way through general revenues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Contributory members shall not be entitled to attend or <span class="highlight">vote</span> at any general meetings or to receive notice thereof. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only medical members have a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is quite a ridiculous situation, because 5 medical members, out of a membership of over one million with dependants of another 2 million-odd, are the only members allowed to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could expect that any government - notwithstanding the fact that its percentage of the national <span class="highlight">vote</span> decreased by 0.3 per cent a few short months ago and that a recent gallup poll showed that it is rapidly losing its standing in the community by a loss of 0.7 per cent over the recent period - would still think, when it has the responsibility of occupying the Treasury -bench, that it would be at least honest in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general plans of the committees of management would need to go to the Industrial Registrar and, after procedures which in themselves are perhaps reasonable are followed, a <span class="highlight">vote</span> could then be taken of the members, although there are exceptions to that, as the Minister has pointed out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worth noting that the Minister himself said that the Act would require that every member of an organisation affected by an amalgamation be supplied with a ballot paper and be given the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So under the Minister’s proposals there can be no guarantee that every number of an organisation will get an appropriate right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> without fear or favour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the provisions of the Act, as they now are, half the members of an organisation need to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and half plus one of those who <span class="highlight">vote</span> need to record a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of the amalgamation for it to be carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the majority of those few members who <span class="highlight">vote</span> cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of the amalgamation it goes through under the provisions introduced by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These things can be done under cover of an amalgamation arrangement, and at the same time the rights of individual members of a union, an organisation, are further reduced because in relation to those unions which have a collegiate system of election, where there is not direct election by the rank and file, the Minister is inserting a provision which states that for 3 years after amalgamation the rank and file members will not get a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister is concerned, as he claims, for the rank and file membership of the union movement, especially after an amalgamation - that is the point I am putting - he would want to give them as soon as possible the opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for those who control that union, run that union and determine its policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in the case of an amalgamation there is all the more reason to see that they have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> as quickly as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now under pressure from some unions which no doubt wanted this circumstance, the Minister has agreed that the rank and file will not get a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in relation to those positions in less than 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The easiest way to indicate our attitude to the total Bill is to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it at the second reading stage for the reasons which I have indicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a number of areas in which, although the Minister said that every member will get a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, they will not and need not get a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even after an amalgamation they would not get a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in relation to office bearers of a union for up to 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They get the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> if they want to go against something that has happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that there are provisions for an absent <span class="highlight">vote</span>, but I have also checked and noted that in many cases nobody ever applies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has made the point  -  I think that the honourable member who is to follow me in the debate might try to confuse the point - that if a member is not prepared to go along to the star night in Newcastle and <span class="highlight">vote</span> toy putting his ballot paper into an upturned hat he can, if he so wishes, ask for an absent <span class="highlight">vote</span> and then <span class="highlight">vote</span> secretly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if members of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union now had a free, secret postal ballot to find out whether they wanted to stay in that amalgamated union under the control of  Mr Halfpenny  they would <span class="highlight">vote</span> themselves out and go back to their old situation pretty quickly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was talking about provisions which would give exemption to a large union making it unnecessary for that union to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> if the smaller de-registered union has  -  I ask the Minister- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister then says that the Registrar would probably conclude that in these circumstances, because they do different things, they ought not to amalgamate unless a <span class="highlight">vote</span> were taken of all union members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in any case, if one company wishes to take over another it is my understanding that the company has to attract to its offer 90 per cent of the value of the company it wishes to take over, and that of course is much tougher than the provisions we had in our legislation which required that 50 per cent of the members should <span class="highlight">vote</span> and that there should be a majority <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of the amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When there is an open <span class="highlight">vote</span> members hands go up, the hands are counted and it is announced to the meeting how many voted one way and how many voted the other way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody ever bothers to find out how many voted one way or the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, when one looks at it critically, and it was explained then, in this situation which has applied one sees that there is no way in which one can compel people to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody can make somebody <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each amalgamation is to be approved by a majority of members who <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a plebiscite of each of the unions proposing to amalgamate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In referring to the right of members to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a ballot on whether they agree to the amalgamation, the Minister said at page 651 of Hansard: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will become the Act if the Bill is passed-  that every member of every organisation affected by the amalgamation shall be supplied with a ballot paper and given the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill refers all the time to a financial member as the member entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a ballot, whereas the existing legislation refers to a member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In pursuing this matter of amalgamation further, I am intrigued by the statement by the Minister that ‘before an amalgamation can be finally registered there will need to be a ballot of all members of both organisations, or, if there are more than 2 organisations, of all the organisations involved; but it will not be necessary to hold up an amalgamation merely because less than 50 per cent of the members eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span> fail to do so’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that we have made an honest assessment of the effect of the proposed legislation and ‘that we have demonstrated our concern for the trade unionists of this country by indicating that we will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“(3) A copy of the scheme of amalgamations submitted under this Part or, if the scheme has been amended in accordance with this Part, of the scheme as so amended, shall accompany each ballot paper sent to a person entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the ballot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“(4) Subject to the next succeeding sub-section, the roll of voters for a ballot shall be a roll of the persons who were members of the organization on the day on which the Industrial Registrar gave his approval under the last preceding section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>more than one-half of the members who record formal votes on those ballot papers <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of the amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed new section again is in the interests of control by the rank and file over union affairs in that it ensures that a reasonable number of people within a union, within an organisation, will have the opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, there will be a requirement upon them to <span class="highlight">vote</span> if the amalgamation is to take place and if their union is to be taken over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nowhere have we been told why there should be a change from a secret ballot by postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> to some other kind of ballot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A unionist can get a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> or an absentee <span class="highlight">vote</span> whenever he likes and the question about putting- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment provides for a ballot of mem bers and unless 50 per cent of the total membership <span class="highlight">vote</span> then even if 49 per cent of the total membership <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of the amalgamation the amalgamation proposal is declared lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If less than 50 per cent of the total membership <span class="highlight">vote</span> it does not matter whether the whole of the 49 per cent are in favour of the proposal; the ballot is deemed to be lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in his second reading speech the Minister said that the Bill will require that every member of every organisation affected by the proposed amalgamation shall - not may - be supplied with a ballot paper and given the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>; not put in a position where he has to go on his knees to <span class="highlight">vote</span>; not put in a position where he has to mark his name up with 249 other men where their names are known, and <span class="highlight">vote</span>; not put in a position where he must go along and apply to the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union for an absent <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who votes absent in that union is a marked man and nobody does because he knows that it would indicate him immediately as against the hierarchy and against those in control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of that union have to apply for an absent <span class="highlight">vote</span> if they want to get a secret <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The way around this problem is for the Government to accept this amendment to make sure that people can <span class="highlight">vote</span> under an Electoral Office controlled secret postal ballot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment does not compel them to <span class="highlight">vote</span>; they do not have to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, but if they want a secret postal ballot at least the amendment will give them the opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an odd thing that the Opposition should go to all this trouble about a compulsory postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> for an amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members record their votes which are put in the ballot box and counted by the scrutineers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that on some f future occasion there will be a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the report of a committee that has been considering the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall thinking at the time that it was most unfair of the Government to gag the honourable member for Mackellar because he had for many years exhibited a great interest in transport  -  I served with him on the Government members rail standardisation Committee - so I voted against the question moved by the honourable member for Bonython: ‘That the question be now put.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My <span class="highlight">vote</span> was not recorded with those of honourable members who voted against the motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediately after this <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes)  took the Chair, and I was happy when he called first the honourable member for Mackellar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After listening to the speech of the honourable member for Mackellar I heard the honourable member for Angas  (Mr Giles)  attempt to get the call, but the Government Whip again moved ‘That the question be now put’, and I again voted with the noes, which <span class="highlight">vote</span> was so recorded at 9.58 p.m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker,  I give notice that at the next sitting I shall present a Bill for an Act to allow electors in certain Territories as well as electors in the States to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums on proposed laws to alter the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I returned to the Caucus meeting to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The promises were great <span class="highlight">vote</span> getters but unplanned, dishonoured and now proving to have been a sham. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That in matters of procedure the  Chairman  or  Deputy Chairman  presiding at a meeting have a deliberative <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and, in the event of an equality of voting, have a casting <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and that, in other matters, the  Chairman  or  Deputy Chairman  have a deliberative <span class="highlight">vote</span> only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure people will not be induced to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it on such a frivolous, flippant and ludicrous ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This provision is very far reaching in the history of Australia in that it changes the constitutional responsibility of the different governments and reduces the ability of an elector to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a specific policy put forward at a State election, for such a policy can be negated by the deliberations of the Federal Minister for Transport or, as the Bills provide, even by a Commonwealth public servant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on this occasion to make my maiden speech as the new member for Bradfield, the electorate which gave the present Government at the last election its lowest <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, having been defeated at the election, having faced the moment of truth where a joint sitting will put the Bill through - it was not rejected by the Senate except for the technicality that the Senate <span class="highlight">vote</span> was evenly divided, and therefore if people are voting evenly in the Senate a proposition is not carried; now it will go through - what do we find? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He spoke about receiving 200,000 more votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Goodness me, 200,000 more votes for the Labor Party! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What he did not tell us is that the Government did not get a majority of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not tell us that the Labor <span class="highlight">vote</span> actually decreased proportionately compared with 1972 figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people did not simply <span class="highlight">vote</span> to change the faces on the front bench; they voted for a basic change in Australian life and for a new and better Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the only area which does return a substantial Labor <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have merely heard it remarked that my Department must be regarded as scrupulously fair, since one of the stenographers in the pool in Tasmania was observed during the recent election handing out how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> cards for a Liberal candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If they do not perform he can then say: ‘I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> them out of office’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the members of the Opposition are opposed to the saving of lives by building better roads, let them <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the amendment, but that will not do them any good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did Australia fail to <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the United States of America, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Fiji in favour of a motion to defer for 12 months the question before the General Assembly of the United Nations in late 1973 as to whether Cambodia should be represented by diplomats of the Lon Nol Government or those of Prince Sihanouk; if so, why. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-36-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As this <span class="highlight">vote</span>, if carried, would almost certainly have led to the expulsion of the existing representative of a government with which the Australian Government has diplomatic relations, what is the reasoning behind his claim that this matter was only a procedural question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-36-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>If the motion had been defeated, resulting in a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the substantive issues, Australia would have voted in favour of the Government with which it had diplomatic relations, that is the Government of the Khmer Republic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-36-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is to enshrine the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I invite honourable members and honourable senators to consider how flagrantly the number of voters varies between the different electorates at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remember that the greater the variation the more the value of a man’s or woman’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> is diminished or inflated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet in New South Wales the enrolment between the largest and smallest electorates varies by 35,000 voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Throughout Australia and even within particular States some people’s votes are worth 50 per cent more than others- in fact, up to 90 per cent more than others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When  Senator McKenna  in 1964 and  Senator Murphy  in 1968 and the honourable member for Grayndler, the father of the Parliament,  Mr Daly  in 1971 introduced the proposals in private members’ Bills, the Liberal and Country Party Ministers would not allow a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be taken upon them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the so-called democratic elections referendum was passed it would allow electorates to be based not on the number of voters but on the number of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A citizen- a qualified voter- is no more or no less so because he lives in the city or on the farm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It affirms the Government’s belief that every person’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> is of equal value no matter where that person lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives to those who sit in this Parliament at this historic Joint Sitting of this Parliament the opportunity to stand up and be counted, to say whether they believe in these democratic principles and, above all, in the supreme principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fundamental test must be one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We support the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value but the Labor Party does not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party put forward a constitutional proposal which would have torpedoed any consideration of the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party wanted to give votes to people under the voting age and to people who were not citizens by drawing up electorates on the basis of population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Labor Party had been allowed to do this it would have created for itself immense political advantage for the Labor Party but would have abandoned the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We agree with the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value but what we feel is important is to make it clear that one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value means that no sectional or geographical group should ever exert more influence than its numbers warrant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But equally we will adhere to the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Excluding that example, the cold mathematical facts are that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> given a value of one in metropolitan Sydney is worth less than a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in outback or rural New South Wales where the value is 1.05. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the Labor Party holds more seats in this House proportionally than the votes it polled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party polled less than 50 per cent of the votes yet it has more than 50 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It put in the referendum proposal an entirely different concept- to redistribute according to population and not according to voters and not according to the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, there is a total denial of all citizen rights in the Upper House of New South Wales, for which nobody has to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In local government in elections for city councils most people have no votes and some have 8 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The weight of a citizen’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> cannot be made to depend on where he lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overriding objective must be substantial equality of population among the various districts, so that the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of any citizen is approximately equal in weight to that of any other citizen in the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was supposed to be the introduction of the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To this end, we intend to amend the law so that, as far as may be practicable, the value of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of one citizen shall be equivalent to the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party claims that it is dedicated to the concept of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party is not dedicated to the concept of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That does not mean that they would have the same number of voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, using the 1971 census as a basis, the Prime Minister would have had in his electorate 46,000 electors, whereas some of the large country electorates would have had 70,000 voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the concept of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value which the Government is putting up is a phoney one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Malcolm  Mackerras, who is a gentleman well known to honourable members and honourable senators as an expert in electoral matters, said that a redrawing of electoral boundaries on the basis of that referendum ‘would result in the greatest departure from the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value ever seen in the history of House of Representatives elections’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask why senators and members really want to change the present electoral laws when the Labor Party won the last election with 49.3 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and gained 52 per cent of the seats in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does the Minister who is in charge of this legislation not mention that in his electorate- that tiny city electorate- he has 6,000 fewer voters than I have in my electorate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both sides say that they believe in equal representation, in one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, but then go on to give their different interpretations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I interpose to point out that he mentioned the Electoral Bill: decided to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst it is somewhat difficult for new members of the Parliament to <span class="highlight">vote</span> according to that premise, because they did not have a hand in causing the double dissolution, I believe that former members of the Parliament who have been returned certainly should support the result of this Joint Sitting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to say that there are many country districts in South Australia which are now accepting the view that there should be equal value through one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the recent byelection which was held to fill the vacancy created when I became a member of the Senate, the Liberal Movement won the State seat on a policy of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value in one of the more conservative country areas in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our purpose is to maintain, as far as is practicable and fair, the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe there is a principle of equal, if not greater importance than the mechanical  theoretical  principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, and that is the principle of equality of representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder how many Liberals there are who will sit subjugated on the Opposition side when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will <span class="highlight">vote</span>, if I can move very briefly aside for the moment, against the other measures which the Government will present to this Joint Sitting and that,  Mr Chairman,  is not because of any particular views held by people on your left. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will certainly <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this Bill and the two other allied electoral Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other thing he told me all his life as we went along on polling days was this: ‘Remember the great Labor principle- <span class="highlight">vote</span> early and <span class="highlight">vote</span> often’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact of life is that the Labor Party is not prepared to settle for 52 per cent of the seats for 49 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>; it wants a Western Australian situation- the first redistribution carried out by a Labor Party Government since 1948. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party got 46 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and it almost got 60 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, Labor Party policy is to <span class="highlight">vote</span> early and <span class="highlight">vote</span> often. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said before, at the last general election the Australian Labor Party polled 49.3 per cent of the primary <span class="highlight">vote</span> and obtained 51.96 per cent of the parliamentary seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact of life is that what the Australian Labor Party wants is 52 per cent of the parliamentary seats for about 45 per cent of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I am concerned, it is still a bad Bill and I intend to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The value of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> of one citizen is no longer equivalent to the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of a citizen in another part of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A political party like the Country Party which rarely receives more than about 10 per cent of the votes of the Australian people has a disproportionate influence on the welfare of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not say that a Tory Upper House which  Senator Withers  supports was all that stopped him from adopting the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Withers  spoke of raising the dead and of the need to <span class="highlight">vote</span> early and often. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at a few members of the Liberal Party I reckon that they have some dead votes and that if there were more cemeteries in their electorates a few of them would not be here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the Parliament believe that electorates should be equal, that one <span class="highlight">vote</span> should have one value and that no person’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> should be worth more than that of another person, regardless of whether he lives in a city or country area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The weight of a citizen ‘s <span class="highlight">vote</span> cannot be made to depend on where he lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On having a good look at the Country Party, I think a few sheep have a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Country Party, which is fighting so vigorously against these proposals, as  Senator Steele  Hall and others have said today, have never polled more then 10.9 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span> but has exercised a parliamentary <span class="highlight">vote</span> of between 16 per cent and 17 per cent and a ministerial influence of more than 20 per cent in Cabinets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 18 May last the Country Party polled 10.7 per cent of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill gives to this historic Joint Meeting of the Australian Parliament the opportunity to give expression to the democratic principle that a person ‘s <span class="highlight">vote</span> is of equal value no matter where he is domiciled and whatever his class, creed or occupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Leader of the Opposition has effectively pointed out, the real test of equitable electoral legislation is that the party which receives the majority of the votes should also receive the majority of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time in respect of the House of Representatives the present Government polled 49.3 per cent of the formal votes and received 5 1 .96 per cent of the seats in the new Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is expressed as a ratio of the percentage of seats to the percentage of votes the result slightly favours the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the fourth paragraph, when he was talking about the referendum concerning democratic elections, he said: This represents a fundamental departure from the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value- the only right and proper principle on which to base electoral redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Prime Minister consider reintroducing last year’s Commonwealth Electoral Bill so that those members who support the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value for the first time, such as the Leader of the Opposition, can <span class="highlight">vote</span> to have his principle enshrined in our electoral law? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the Opposition now has a chance to put its <span class="highlight">vote</span> where its Leader’s words were, but we all know what will happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This question will be decided on the numbers of the Government against those of the Opposition, with the single exception of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of  Senator Hall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there any logic in saying that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Darling ought to be worth 8 times a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Mallee? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can then service their constituents and not come into this House with a weighted <span class="highlight">vote</span> which goes against every principle of democratic elections which we hold dear in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much has been made this morning of the statement that the Australian Labor Party received only 49 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> but 52 per cent of the seats in the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when we look at the preferred <span class="highlight">vote</span>- after all our system is of a preferential nature- we find that the situation is completely different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the preferred <span class="highlight">vote</span> the Australian Labor Party, which sits in the House of Representatives as the Government, had much more than 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The combined <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Country Party, the Liberal Party and the Democratic Labor Party over Australia, is very much less than 50 per cent of the total. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact of the total votes polled, the Australian Labor Party polled about 250,000 more than the combined votes of the Liberal Party, the Country Party and the Democratic Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what we are discussing and what this Bill puts before the Parliament is whether we will so organise our electorates that every person at voting age will have his <span class="highlight">vote</span> weighed equally, not in the way which has happened in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gladstone once said: ‘Do our opponents believe in counting votes or weighing them?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is where one gets the weighing of votes to suit a series of areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It allows for one person one <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a most important part of our democratic structure that governments should be elected on the basis of one person one <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With modern travel there is absolutely no reason why we should weigh the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of country electors more than city electors, because country members are more in contact with their constituents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are very good reasons why we should pass a law which will enable the principle of one person one <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be enshrined in the legislation used to decide what members are to represent the various areas of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I support the BiD and suggest to honourable members opposite that they should change their minds and <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Government on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall that the Government put before the Senate two different Bills, the present Bill and another which was totally at variance with the concept of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said that the Country Party received only 10.6 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It obtained more than 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the seats it contested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government of the day had a redistribution which resulted in the Labor Government gaining 42 seats in the Parliament with 46 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Forty-eight per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> gave the Liberal and Country parties 31 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government has said repeatedly that the value of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of one citizen should be equivalent to the value of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the 20 per cent variation in the quota, the average number of voters in country electorates is lower than the average number of voters in city electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So what the Labor Government is saying is that it is wrong for a country <span class="highlight">vote</span> to have a greater mathematical value than a city <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During this debate we have heard a great deal about the concept of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, but no speaker on the Government side of the chamber has made a prediction as to what difference this reduction in percentage variation will make to country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr Chairman, so far this debate has been quite notorious because so many speakers have spoken in favour of the principles of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value but at the same time have expressed their intention to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the principle which they have espoused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘<span class="highlight">Vote</span> early and <span class="highlight">vote</span> often’ was another message he gave us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances it is even more essential that every citizen’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> should have equal value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It took a massive <span class="highlight">vote</span> to shift them off the perch or to move them off the throne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been argued in this Parliament in the past that there has never been an occasion when the party with the majority of votes has not had the majority of seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1954 the Australian Labor Party received 50.1 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and the Liberal and Country Parties received 47 per cent; but the Liberal and Country Parties remained in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1961 the Australian Labor Party received 47.99 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and the Liberal and Country Parties received 41.98 per cent; but the Liberal and Country Parties continued to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1969 the Australian Labor Party received 46.95 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and the Liberal and Country Parties received 43.3 per cent; yet the Liberal and Country Parties continued to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1972 the Australian Labor Party gained 49.59 per cent of the primary votes and 41.48 per cent of the primary votes went to the Liberal and Country Parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It took that proportion of the primary votes to change the government and put the category A boys in their place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that every person who believes in the democratic concept will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With one exception the party that got the majority of votes formed the Government, and that is the real test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, at the last election on 18 May I thought the Labor Government was pretty lucky because with less than 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> it got about 52 per cent of the number of seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> of each person right across the country should be equal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We heard a diatribe about what a dreadful thing it would be if we had to go back to the position of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value and that the Labor Party would be in office for a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If country people only realised that the Country Party could never form a government they would <span class="highlight">vote</span> its members right out of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the present situation, the Labor Party can poll 5 or 6 per cent or more of the votes than the Opposition Parties but can only obtain a narrow majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should come back to the principle on which the Constitution was founded and pass this legislation in order to make sure that when the people <span class="highlight">vote</span> for candidates there is an equal opportunity for each political party to form a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not say that these are the ways people must <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole purpose of this legislation is not the cause of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, as so righteously claimed by those who sit on the Government side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of the Australian Labor Party to the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value is clearly demonstrated by the words of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  that have been quoted already today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister then submitted to the Distribution Commissioners that an extra 4,000 voters should be taken from the seat of Prospect and added to the seat of Reid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The upshot of that would have been a further move away from the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value because the Prime Minister’s proposal would have increased the electorate of Prospect from 3.68 per cent to 11 per cent below the quota and would have made the electorate of Reid 16.82 percent above the quota. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the real attitude of the Labor Party to the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He always used to talk about the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, for some reason the Minister for Services and Property, who is sitting at the table, is trying to tell us that by reducing the variation from 20 per cent to 10 per cent we have reached the great state of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This afternoon during this debate we have heard speakers from the Opposition side refer to the great esteem they have for the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as speakers from this side of the House have often reminded the Opposition parties, so far only one member from that side had indicated that he is prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in accordance with the principles that he espouses in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will see within the next hour or so that his <span class="highlight">vote</span> will support it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several Liberal senators might not <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Bill . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we found that they were forced by the Country Party to toe the line, and they did <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government says, through its speakers here today and elsewhere , that it is really providing one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a sham to say that this Bill or any similar Bill would provide truly for one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has not told us whether we will there have a true one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value or how Aborigines will be treated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not heard whether the redistribution will be on a basis of population or on a basis of voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would wish to be able to denigrate the Senate in carrying out its constitutional function which has just been reinforced by the people of Australia in a fully democratic <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some of the articles contained therein are ‘The Best <span class="highlight">Vote</span> for Years’ by Bob Southey; ‘How I Lost, Drew and Won Stirling’ by Ian Viner; ‘What’s So Different About Queensland?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People stood here and accused him of not bringing in the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How could he bring in the principal of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value in the Upper House in South Australia that was controlled by the conservatives with a majority of 16 to 4? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the South Australian elections in 1968, when the Labor Party received almost 54 per cent of the votes but were defeated in government, 20,000 people marched from the parade grounds in Adelaide to Light Square to demonstrate against the iniquitous electoral system that operated in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 9 elections held under  Sir Thomas  Playford ‘s Government, Labor won the majority of votes in 8 elections but it never governed during that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  glibly repeats the phrase ‘one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value means just that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the moment the Minister refers to a 10 per cent variation, that is the end of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to have one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, that is it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been 11 elections since 1949, and in 10 out of 1 1 cases the Government of the day has gained a greater percentage of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> than has the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1949 the then Liberal-Country Party coalition beat the Labor Party by2 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>; in 195 1, by 2 per cent; and in 1954,I admit, the Australian Labor Party beat our <span class="highlight">vote</span> by 4 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1974 the Australian Labor Party’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> slipped back and it beat us by 2.3 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the ALP gained power in 1972 with 49.71 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and held power in 1974 with 49.3 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> indicates that the system is not as the Government attempts to make it out to be and is not loaded against the ALP Government as it would like the people to believe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It needed only 11 more votes in one seat in that State, as my friend the honourable member for Stirling  (Mr Viner)  can confirm, and it would have won 60 per cent of the seats on 46 per cent of the State <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage, and shall be held by secret <span class="highlight">vote</span> or by equivalent free voting procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The American Constitution did not allow the Territories to send members to Congress but simply permitted the Territories to send delegates to Congress who could speak but not <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Concepts of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value have not influenced the Australian Labor Party to deny that overrepresentation to the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That explains why the Opposition parties will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against both of these Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If, for example, one looks at the quotas which senators have to achieve to be elected in the States of New South Wales and Victoria at a periodic half Senate election, and then looks at what would be required to elect a senator from the Territories one will have not only a remarkable admiration for the dexterity with which the one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value principle can be espoused and then denied by members of the Labor Party, but also a picture of how unjust the representation would be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1970- the figures would be greater now, of course- a person required almost 300,000 votes to be elected as a senator in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But to be elected a senator for the Australian Capital Territory all that would have been required in 1973 was 28,000 votes and to be elected a senator from the Northern Territory all that would have been required was 10,600 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Where is the one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value principle of the Labor Party in that concept? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only say, to make point of what I have been stating, that in 1969 the Liberal Party secured 22.8 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1972 the Liberal Party secured 26 per cent of the votes and again the result would have been the same and members of the Labor Party know this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, in 1974 when in so many significant parts of the country the dangers of a continuing Labor Government were recognised the Liberal Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> swelled to a much higher percentage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, I am confident, the belief of the Labor Party is that by the distribution of Government largesse and by the exercise of patronage the necessary votes can be secured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is in denial of the one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value principle, which was the kernel of their support for the previous measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How can there be one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value when 28,000 votes in the Northern Territory will elect one senator and 300,000 votes are required to elect one senator in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a denial of the one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value principle and it is the Labor Party which is putting up this proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members should remember that the Government of the day in 1968 refused the right of that Bill to go to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When members of the Opposition meet in their party room, do they <span class="highlight">vote</span> as senators from Tasmania, Victoria or Western Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cares nothing for the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I rather thought he would be most apprehensive after the allegation which he has made about people who have been validly elected to a corporation which was established by <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this chamber and, in the electoral process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member is suggesting that senators are voted for in anything but a regular fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nonsense that this Government is perpetuating in this Bill is that whereas a moment ago it suggested one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value it is now saying that one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value means nought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that if honourable senators and members- even those few on the Government side who think sanely and sensibly about the implications of this legislation- genuinely believe that the statement of Edmund Burke that bad laws make for the worst form of government should not be seen to be repeated by the Government in this Parliament, they should cast thenvotes against this measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What do people from overseas think when they go to the Alice Springs district and they are told that the people who live in this international tourist resort do not have a representative voice in the Senate and that they cannot even <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referenda which propose changes in the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To save his skin, he gave notice last week that he would introduce a private member’s Bill which would give the people of the Northern Territory a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This magnificent Opposition, as it is now, did not allow these Bills to go to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They went to the second reading stage, but the then Government would not allow them to go to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> because the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the honourable member for the Northern Territory would be registered against the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No doubt he would be very quick to point out that on 29 May 1973 each member of the Country Party in the House of Representatives voted for the Senate (Representation of Territories) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaker  after  speaker,  including the Leader of the Country Party and the honourable member for New England  (Mr Sinclair),  the  Deputy  Leader of the Country Party, got up and opposed giving the people of the Northern Territory a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for Senate representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a word for these sorts of people who get up and speak- as they have done- and refuse to give the people of the Northern Territory a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Senate but at the same time refuse to record their names in division so that it can be seen where they stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the Parliament look with great pride to when this <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be taken, because when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken we will see a majority of votes- as is needed under the Constitution- in this Joint Sittingto give the people of the Northern Territory the just rights for which they have been fighting since 1911. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every member on this side of the House will be watching the performance of the honourable member for the Northern Territory to see which way he votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let him cast his <span class="highlight">vote</span> as we know he will cast it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the Parliament, when it comes to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> - (Opposition members interjecting)- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Indeed, one of the aspirants for the Ministry who missed by one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, I understandSenator James McClelland- in the debate on 17 July, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government were truly seeking representation for the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory it would recognise what we did, that is, encourage them and change their representation in this Parliament so that their representatives <span class="highlight">vote</span> on all matters and not merely on Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory matters; it would propose and support other propositions for their development and it would not bring in this form of piecemeal legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other argument that I have located is that the election of Territory senators would be anomalous and that they would <span class="highlight">vote</span> according to sectional and regional interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told that they would not <span class="highlight">vote</span> with a national outlook. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the fact is that senators <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Senate as they do in the House of Representatives, that is, on Party lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me come to the great cry, the clarion call, that came from the Government benches this afternoon- one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>when I mention one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it that they press upon the Parliament and the people this argument for 2 senators from the Northern Territory and 2 senators from the Australian Capital Territory when the Australian Capital Territory has approximately four times the numbers of voters on its roll as are on the Northern Territory roll? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> of one senator from the Northern Territory will have precisely the same voting strength as that of the distinguished and gallant senator from New South Wales,  Senator Sir Kenneth  Anderson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as a matter of arithmetic, what justice is to be found in these figures: 240,000 Tasmanian voters elect 15 representatives to the national Parliament; 95,000 Canberra voters elect 2 representatives to the national Parliament; and 30,000 Northern Territorians elect one representative to the national Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been constantly twitted on what the Opposition appears to regard as some great logical inconsistency: that what we are putting up in this Bill represents some sort of departure from the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value which guides us in these things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the implication in the denial by the Opposition of a right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Senate to those numbers I have mentioned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What members opposite are saying is that, so far as the Senate is concerned, 100,000 votes in the ACTU should have no value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this very Bill some Opposition senators voted differently from their colleagues in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be recalled that when the motion for the second reading of the Bill was agreed to by the House of Representatives on 29 May 1973 it was carried by 78 votes to 43 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seventeen members of the Country Party crossed the floor and voted with the Government, the other 3 members of the Country Party being absent when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the motion for the second reading of the Bill was taken in the Senate all 5 <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Senate has constitutional authority and I have power to persuade in the country, I will use my <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Senate to establish the right of the people who voted for me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is not a case now of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value; it is a case where, with all the wisdom of the Caucus on petrol price equalisation schemes and so on, and with all the genius of Caucus to keep down interest rates and provide decent economic housing, they might need a little assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why, instead of allowing them to have their little gerrymanders in the several States in order to divide the Molonglo or the Yarra or the hills of Sydney, they gave us in the Senate a chamber where State boundaries are the discrimen and the people of the States <span class="highlight">vote</span> as one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We talk about one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Northern Territory has about 40,000 voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He reminded me of all the campaigns in history and of all the occasions on which people have opposed every attempt to change any social situation- from putting the Plimsoll line on ships to the 40-hour week, to giving people the <span class="highlight">vote</span> at 21, to giving women the <span class="highlight">vote</span> at all and to the roads of ruin of which politics are always so full. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All of us here know that in the politics of confrontation we do come to <span class="highlight">vote</span> one side against the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having set the stage, Senate representation and, for that matter, a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a referendum for Territorians, has been on my platform for the Northern Territory since 1966, but reservedly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By all means let electors in the Australian Capital Territory have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of Australia did not fall for it so there went our chance to get a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least I have introduced a Bill to give the people in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a referendum without having strings tied to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It happened one day in 1968 when I was successful in obtaining a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the member for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the then Prime Minister,  Mr Gorton,  said in effect in this place that he would grant the member for the Northern Territory a <span class="highlight">vote</span> the then Leader of the Opposition looked like some sort of mullet just out of the water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that perhaps at this late hour, as the honourable member for the Northern Territory, he would have thrown some light on some of the curious performances that we have seen coming from his colleagues with regard the entitlements of the Australian people to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that as the member for the Northern Territory he might have been able to explain to us how it is that when the Opposition approaches the voting rights of those people who are entitled to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> it says that their electorates should be gerrymandered, and when it comes to the voting entitlements of those people who are not entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> it says they should not be able to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ultimately we found that  Mr Calder  indicated an intention to cross the floor to <span class="highlight">vote</span> with us, but not without a valiant effort to get himself thrown out of this Joint Sitting by deliberately provoking the Chair, by deliberately acting in such a way that in any other sitting, if we had not had such a tolerant Acting  Chairman  as you,  Sir, he  would have been ejected from the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, he wanted to be ejected from the chamber so that he would not have to cross the floor and <span class="highlight">vote</span> with us and go back and answer to the people of the Northern Territory as to why he had repeatedly betrayed them in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We believe that it is intolerable that any Australian, wherever he may live, whatever his ethnic origin or whatever his educational standard may be, should be deprived of the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the election of the Parliament of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Did they not repeatedly inside the Parliament <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the member for the Northern Territory having a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the House of Representatives until the Country Party gained a member from the Northern Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did they not down the years, when the Australian Labor Party proposed that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> should be given to the Northern Territory, deny the right of the people of the Northern Territory to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The first member for the Northern Territory was elected in 1922, and until 1936 he had no <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Gippsland asks: ‘Who gave the <span class="highlight">vote</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did not suit its case when it was arguing this afternoon in relation to one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, but it does suit its case now that it is talking about Senate representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will mean and should mean, in effect, that anyone who receives about 34 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in either of those Territories should win a seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the first occasion it was presented to the Parliament the Country Party voted for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the last occasion the Country Party managed to talk out the time allotted for consideration of the legislation so that it would not come to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make an appeal to  Senator Hall,  who I understand is to oppose these Bills but who then by some curious system of logic, after these Bills are passed by the sheer weight of numbers, will sacrifice the principle on which he opposes these Bills and <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the enabling Bills when they are introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr Chairman, section 57 of the Constitution provides that where the requirements for a joint sitting have been satisfied the sitting shall <span class="highlight">vote</span> but may deliberate; that is, it need not necessarily deliberate on the proposed laws put before it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that if these Bills are passed, as the march of numbers means they will be, it is certain that every man sitting on the Government side of the chamber who votes for them will rue the day, because it is an absolute certainty that each generation will pass on its achievements or its failures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this health scheme goes through, this generation will be passing on a vast failure and those who <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it will regret it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion, a <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this Bill is a <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the rights of good health of one million Australians who are uninsured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although we have been regarded as obstructing the wish of the Australian Government to introduce its health scheme, I believe that I represent the people of Victoria who have elected me to this place, and I assure them that it will not be my <span class="highlight">vote</span> that will enable a nationalised health scheme to be introduced into this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that with the health Bills all Queensland senators will <span class="highlight">vote</span> together, as they have been clearly instructed to do, and reject them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now therefore I,  Sir John  Robert Kerr, the GovernorGeneral of Australia, do by this my Proclamation convene a joint sitting of the members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, to commence in the House of Representatives Chamber at Parliament House, Canberra at 10.30 o’clock in the morning on 6 August 1 974, at which they may deliberate and shall <span class="highlight">vote</span> together upon each of the said proposed laws as last proposed by the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that that final paragraph might penetrate the intellect of the honourable member for Mackellar let me repeat it slowly:   at which they may deliberate and shall <span class="highlight">vote</span> together upon each of the said proposed laws as last proposed by the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate reaffirmed this point of view by taking a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on an amendment that this Bill be not allowed to proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That amendment was defeated by an equal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having again achieved a mandate we are now engaged in this first historic sitting of this Joint Parliament and honourable senators and honourable members are to be asked to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that a favourable <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the motion which will be put at the end of this sitting tonight will not see the Bill in the clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To hunt, and <span class="highlight">vote</span> and raise the price of corn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He Will find that not one electorate which has a mining centre in it did anything but considerably lower the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of those candidates who stood for the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite a remarkable thing that in the electorate of Kalgoorlie there was a tremendous swing in votes against a man who was highly regarded in that area but who had one great burden to carry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for Representative Katter’s concern about royalties in mining communities, I have been advised by Representative Fitzpatrick that he obtained 75 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Cobar; so that refutes his stupid reasoning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a rather sneaking suspicion that when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken later this evening it will be carried and the legislation will become law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister and his followers behind him are like ‘greyhounds in the slips straining upon the start’- sorry, the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and the finish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let the <span class="highlight">vote</span> be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to win the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the suspension of Standing Orders if we are to debate this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we know that we cannot win the <span class="highlight">vote</span> because the march of numbers will apply against us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it was framed as an urgency motion on which there would not have been a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, no doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government in the Senate obtained an absolute majority in the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on that legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We shall not support it and it will be opposed when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did Australia <span class="highlight">vote</span> in support of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2984 (xxvii), on 14 December 1972, which inter alia called for a time-table to be established for the self-determination and independence of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-73-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Act says that where an organisation is a party to an industrial dispute and where the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission thinks that the settlement of the dispute would be encouraged or assisted by ascertaining the views or attitude of the members of the organisation in relation to the matter, the Commission may order that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of those members for the purpose of ascertaining their views or attitude in relation to that matter be taken by secret ballot in accordance with the directions given by the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A person shall not, in connection with a ballot ordered by the section, obstruct the taking of the ballot, use any form of intimidation, threaten, or in any way suggest that a person might <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a particular way or that he be forced to omit to <span class="highlight">vote</span> or that he be forced to support or oppose a proposition or that he should promise to <span class="highlight">vote</span> or that he should show his ballot paper to any other person than the person who is registering the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was in 1811 that  Mr Speaker  Abbott in the House of Commons laid down that no person who had a pecuniary interest should <span class="highlight">vote</span> upon any matter and any person who had a pecuniary interest should declare it to the House in which he speaks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it sufficient that his <span class="highlight">vote</span> and his voice be judged in the light of the public knowledge and the knowledge of other honourable members that he has such an interest? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> of a member may not be challenged except on a substantive motion moved immediately after the division is completed, and the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of a member determined to be so interested shall be disallowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party seeks by all its electoral proposals only to see that the candidate or Party that secures the majority of votes gets the majority of seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is me, Kevin Cairns, whom he named-  abused every privilege that he had, including using an employee of the divisional returning officer for Lilley- a poor unfortunate woman whom he got hold of and on whom he used his vicious influence to get her to send out propaganda for him and to send out together with the ballot papers for the postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> applicant a how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> card for Kevin Cairns, the Liberal candidate for Lilley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a member of the Australian Labor Party whose electorate is partially rural I must emphasise that what I have to say in Dapto, where I receive 75 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>, also has to be heard 20 miles away in Kangaroo Valley, where I receive 23 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of the favouritism that the Government has shown towards these areas in its giant <span class="highlight">vote</span> catching action, the people have rejected it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two resolutions passed were adopted without a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and a formal intervention by the Australian representative was not required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-61-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I presume that he would want to increase the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> by the 3.5 per cent that he rather regularly mentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740925_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest that the Minister who moved the amendment might elaborate on what he proposes because it seems that at this stage we are being asked to make a blanket decision in what will ultimately be a snap <span class="highlight">vote</span>, particularly if debate is curtailed and discussion cannot take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I cast my mind back I recall it was these same people who advised others to <span class="highlight">vote</span> no in the prices and incomes referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He explained that the matter to which I referred, which concerned a certain malpractice that took place during the 1972 federal election campaign in regard to the issue of postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> ballot papers in Lilley, was something with which he had absolutely nothing to do and of which he had no knowledge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was quite clear beyond any shadow of doubt that during that campaign how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> cards for the honourable member for Lilley who was, at that time also, the honourable member for Lilley, were sent out with postal ballot papers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important that I restate the undeniable fact that at that time postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> malpractices took place in the Division of Lilley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that this went on in Lilley in 1972 and that many other malpractices have been associated with postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> collection in recent years, particularly in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister will introduce into this House very shortly some measures that will eliminate, to a great extent, the opportunities that exist for zealous party workers who at times are not prepared to play the game as straight as they should to involve themselves in the malpractices that have been known to exist in the past within the postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> system as it is currently allowed to exist under the provisions of the Electoral Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that all honourable members will support the Government when that legislation is introduced into the House and debated here, so that we can eliminate some of the opportunities that exist for malpractice within the present postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Notwithstanding a statement made by the Prime Minister, when asking the Tasmanians to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for him, that he would make sea freight transport costs to and from Tasmania the same as mainland rail transport costs, there is the Minister for Transport, who is supposed to fulfil the policy undertaking, the election promise, saying the Government is not prepared to subsidise in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, I remind the right honourable gentleman that, outside the leadership of the Labor Party, the Minister for Minerals and Energy was elected to the Ministry with the highest <span class="highlight">vote</span> in June this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> has been increased by $2m this year and no doubt he has his sights on a still higher <span class="highlight">vote</span> next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment and I hope that it will not be long before Australians understand that they have a group of people in their Government who do not know what they are doing as far as this nation and its economy is concerned, people who appear to have a very limited sense of” responsibility and who allow- the best one can say- their compassion and their sincerity to get the better of their own judgment, people who want something for nothing and who set abroad in this country this pernicious belief that you can get something for nothing when you can not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would not matter to the Treasurer; it would not matter to the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  because he is aiming his strategy at the people in the suburbs and the cities and he is hoping against hope, I feel, that they may <span class="highlight">vote</span> him back at a future election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It took the people of Western Australia and Queensland, where a strong anti-Government <span class="highlight">vote</span> was recorded, to show the way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The passing of the Democratic Labor Party, the syphoning off of the right wing <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Victoria to the Liberal Party and the resurgence of support which the Labor Party has been given, have evened up the stocks of political parties in Australia so that the Australian electorate is very finely balanced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party has achieved more than 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> at successive elections and sometimes we have been unable to form a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when the Liberal Party realised that the Australian electorate appreciated the fact that a major party researched policies, cared about policies and thought about them before they opportunistically offered policies at an election to try to buy votes it realised that it should have federal conferences to try to thrash out policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope the two of you will get together and try to sort it out because the Minister for Overseas Trade, whom I understand you <span class="highlight">vote</span> for with a consistency to be admired, has put it plainly on the line that the system must be changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suppose Opposition members think that everyone in Australia would <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a policy like that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If you allow this amendment,  Sir, it  will mean that this House will not be able to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the honourable member’s motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I well recollect that on one occasion the Opposition moved in effect a motion of no confidence or a motion of censure on the then Prime Minister and the then  Speaker  allowed the motion to be turned around and it ended up as a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence in the then Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I come to the second proposition I would assert, that is that I can see nothing wrong with the democratic test of the feeling of the House by putting this matter to the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken we will then see what views members of the Parliament hold on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not certain of the outcome of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> but I tend to suspect that the majority of members will be intelligent enough to support the view I am putting and that is that this amendment really strengthens and gives point to the whole course of the debate this morning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Members who are expected to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for Government policies in the Parliament should be entitled to exercise their rights to challenge matters when they consider it necessary and to express opinions on decisions of a smaller group of their members, no matter what positions they may happen to hold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, I think, is reasonable, but it is irresponsible to say that Caucus and members should have no right to express an opinion within their own Party on matters on which they are expected to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What these Press articles are saying is that the only rights that members of the public have in electing members to Parliament- this applies equally to Opposition members- is that they shall <span class="highlight">vote</span> on election day, that those they elect shall come to Canberra and <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a leader and having chosen that leader for the next 3 years they will have no right to exercise any authority over that leader or members of the Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  will know, the Prime Minister or his Department was good enough to provide honourable members with some short notes on various items which are covered in this <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Prime Minister aware of the allegation made during the weekend that Australia was refusing to grant political asylum to Eastern European diplomats as a part of a cynical political exercise to curry favour with Eastern European nations with the object of securing their <span class="highlight">vote</span> for Australia’s nomination for the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly next year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It sought through a special Premier’s Conference a voice and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for local government on the Australian Loan Council and it proceeded with a referendum to enable the Constitution to be amended to empower the national Parliament to borrow on behalf of local government and grant financial assistance to local government directly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so many honourable members on the Government side promised the supporting fathers representatives when they came to Canberra that they would help them, surely they will be grateful for the opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> here in the House tonight and to make their words good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have, I think, got round the rather devious tricks of the Government and we are bringing the thing out into the open honestly as it should be and people can <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it one way or the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are proposing, of course, is not a final scheme but it is what the Supporting Fathers Association asked for as a first step, and as such those members who have made promises to representatives of the Association when they came to see them here can now show by their votes in this House whether they are men of their word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It will be simple and it will be illustrative to see which members of the Labor Party who have given pledges to get votes will now cross the floor and <span class="highlight">vote</span> on a social service matter in accordance with their conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps he is worried about whether he should really have the courage of his convictions in what he is saying and cross the floor when it comes to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Opposition’s amendment to bring in provisions for supporting fathers and deserted fathers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The plight of the Australian farmers is being continually overlooked because we have a lame duck Minister in the Minister for Agriculture,  Senator Wriedt,  who cannot and apparently does not have the inclination to win a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accept that the Government has not had time to cost these alterations, but that only adds to my argument that the Parliament should not be expected to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this measure until there has been sufficient time to ascertain what the cost will be and how the Government will raise the money to meet it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although many Opposition members support the concept and philosophical thrust of thus Bill and its proposals to care for people who have no adequate cover, I do not think any honourable member would be prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it as it is presently presented to the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said before, in New Zealand it was something like 2 or 3 years after the proposal went to a select committee before the legislation was presented for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Parliament of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members opposite think that we are going to fall for a confidence trick like that and that the Opposition will support this legislation without a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and without a fight at this stage and then be able to throw that up because of some cheap, tawdry, insincere deal involving sending this to a committee for 3 weeks then they have bargained wrongly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Based on the 1974-75 financial year, a cut of 8 per cent in the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> would mean a reduction of $ 128m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No one will deny that there has been a gradual fall in the percentage of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> spent on equipment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To a great extent this has of course largely been caused by the need to spend more of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on pay and improved conditions of servicemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> itself has been increased from $ 1,334m last financial year to $ 1,4098m in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The plain fact is that in peacetime in a low threat situation the important thing is to keep manpower to minimum levels commensurate with the basic function of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>, that is, the maintenance of skills and the ability to man the warships and aircraft available to which I referred earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member also mentioned that only 7 per cent of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> is being spent on new equipment, yet he congratulated the Minister on the way in which he was modernising equipment across the board and not going in for glamour items like Fills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In contrast to the Opposition which clearly is set to divide country and city because it wishes to maintain its shrinking power base- to demonstrate the lengths it will go to maintain that shrinking power base I need only mention that it would decimate the democratic principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value- and vilify our policies for the rural sector, quite conveniently forgetting to point out the millions of dollars that are injected into the rural area through the several programs of the Government, and in particular the combined and integrated programs of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development, the Government, through the Minister, has undertaken detailed negotiations with the State governments and local governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The people of Queanbeyan <span class="highlight">vote</span> very well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In answer to the honourable member for Port Adelaide let me say that it is true that the Queensland Premier survives on 19 per cent of the votes of the guided democracy known as Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that on the last occasion both the Liberal Party and the Labor Party got more votes than the Country Party but obtained less seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party, with more votes than any of the other parties, got less seats than the other parties combined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that great democrat who leads Queensland hopes that his 1 9 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> will continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly he is quite confident of success because even a most unskilled politician ought to be able to win if he requires only 19 per cent of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure them that under the democratic proposals of the present Whitlam Government such a state of affairs will never happen in the Federal arena where people will have to get the majority of the votes to get the results that are necessary in any democracy, and that is democratic majority rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party’s policy, endorsed by a Joint Sitting of this Parliament, supports the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value and the submissions made by the Australian Labor Party are on that basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nowadays he could not get a single <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Caucus because he spoke out at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know quite well that the Opposition would have the Prime Minister’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a secret ballot on that question in this Parliament, and I think it would also have the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Minister for Labor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope they will be supported with his <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one sees eleven out of eleven Australian Labor Party members being defeated in the council elections in Broken Hill and seventeen out of nineteen seats in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly being won by the National Liberal Party and the other 2 seats going to Independents and when one sees the Australian Labor Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Australian Capital Territory being reduced from 5 1 to 24 per cent, the Press is beginning to appreciate that the people of Australia do not need to be guided in these matters, that they are waking up to the regimentation that the Labor Party is inflicting on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These include: optional preferential marking of ballot-paper; printing of party affiliations of candidates on ballot-papers; registration of political parties for purposes of identification and printing of affiliations on ballot-papers; introduction of mobile polling booths at hospitals and similar institutions; drawing for positions of candidates on House of Representatives ballot-papers; closing of the polls at 6 p.m. rather than 8 p.m.; requiring a candidate changing his name within 12 months prior to nominations to declare the change, and providing for the former name to be included on the ballotpaper; prevention of persons enrolling or nominating for election under changed names in certain circumstances; an earlier deadline for the return of postal votes and for the return of postal votes direct to respective returning officers; restricting postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> application forms to be used at an election or referendum to those specified by notice in the Gazette; prohibiting the listing of names of persons who apply for postal votes, except in certain specified circumstances; providing postal voting facilities for prisoners who have retained their franchise entitlements; increasing the amount of deposit required with nomination and varying the conditions under which deposits may be saved; preservation of the voting entitlement of Australian citizens posted overseas in the service of the Crown, and retention on the roll of the name of an elector temporarily absent from his address; precluding nomination for election to the Australian Parliament of a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory or the Australian Capital Territory; prevention of a person from nominating as a candidate for more than one Federal election held on the same day; protection of candidates against the issue of misleading how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards; change in qualifications for enrolment, voting and candidature from ‘British subject’ to ‘status of a British subject’; eliminating the need to state the address of author in the case of broadcasting or telecasting of political matters; the manner of announcing the name of an author of political matter on radio or television; responsibility for publication of matter or comment of a political nature in the Press between issue of the writ and the close of the poll; removal of the restriction on exhibition of electoral posters within a hall or room being used for political party meetings; provision of support staff for Distribution Commissioners; authority for alterations to the roll when a street is renamed or renumbered; lowering the permissible age of presiding officers or assisting presiding officers to 18 years; appointment of substitute assistant returning officer at places outside Australia in certain circumstances; increases in penalties for failure to enrol; the provision of fines as an alternative to imprisonment where relevant; amounts of monetary penalties to match imprisonment terms; amendment of questions to be put to voters by presiding officers; conversion of distances to metric measurements; use of ‘given names’ in lieu of ‘Christian names’; candidates making gifts, donations, etc., prior to an election; retitling of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the existing preferential system, each voter, irrespective of his individual wishes in the matter, is compelled to rank in order of preference all the candidates on the ballot paper, whether this requires the marking of only 2 squares or, as was the case in the most recent Senate election in New South Wales, not less than 73. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This often means that an elector, in order to record a valid <span class="highlight">vote</span>, is compelled to express a preference for candidates whom he may not know or for whom he has an extreme dislike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existing system of preferential voting has resulted in an average informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> of about 10 per cent at normal Senate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, in order to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, patients confined to bed must at present make an application for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> prior to polling day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill also makes provision for votes to be recorded at specially designated hospitals and institutions before polling day itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, the past practice of party workers invading such institutions for the apparent purpose of assisting postal voters should be largely eliminated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Government is particularly anxious, as I feel all honourable members are, to prevent unscrupulous persons taking advantage of aged or infirm electors, it is also proposed to prohibit the inspection of postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> applications for the purpose of listing of names of persons who apply for postal votes at an election, except where such listing is genuinely required in connection with an inquiry into possible malpractices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under a proposed provision, the only postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> application forms which may be used at an election will be those specified or declared to be applicable by the Chief Australian Electoral Officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposal is designed to curb the current dubious practice of having thousands of postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> applications completed months in advance of the next ensuing election, then forwarding these to electors at or about the time of the issue of writs, without any precise knowledge as to whether the persons concerned are, in fact, entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> by post. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill also clarifies the circumstances under which an Australian citizen in the service of the Crown posted overseas may retain his right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are the ones who will give you a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Senate’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let him put on a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Senate for the Northern Territory any time he likes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this motion will be the clearest indication of where the Treasurer stands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this motion will also provide the answer to the question whether the Prime Minister has been misleading the House in his evasive and ambiguous answers to questions about the Treasurer both in the House and in the Press over the past few weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have moved this motion so that those members on the Government side who have been attempting a last minute rescue operation on behalf of the Treasurer will have the opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the way they have been speaking inside their own Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That motion seeks a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence in the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  because of the compromised position in which the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  has placed the Treasurer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the honourable member that this was a personal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact it was a blackmail <span class="highlight">vote</span> because during the campaign for the last Brisbane City Council election people were told that if they did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Australian Labor Party they would not get anything from Alderman Jones, because he is a dictator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it was a blackmail <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About only 20 per cent of the people bother to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is, however, that they will have to face the same situation as they did in the last election when day after day they saw their <span class="highlight">vote</span> obviously drifting away as the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  and the Leader of the Country Party got into an unholy mess trying to work out which cuts could be made in expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it intends to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker,  it is our intention tonight, if it is possible in the time that is available to us, to push this Bill to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, there should be time for us to bring the matter to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, I think that the <span class="highlight">vote</span> that we witnessed in the Northern Territory where in the 19 electorates, all contested by the Australian Labor Party, the Labor Party did not win a seat- 17 seats were won by the Country-Liberal Party candidates and 2 were won by Independents- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not really think that it was a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence in the personality of the present Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the Government insists that it is mandatory that they declare their interests and that they are not allowed to take decisions or to <span class="highlight">vote</span> upon matters in which they have a financial interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did countries like Australia, Britain, Germany and all the other European countries abstain from a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to prevent this gentleman from speaking? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did all those European countries give him a standing ovation and <span class="highlight">vote</span> to allow him to speak? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are hoping for a unanimous <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the House expressing its view as the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  has stated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable members know, that is a Government measure, but only to the point of being introduced in the Senate and being brought to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, from the Government’s point of view, and one hopes that it will be the same with the Opposition parties, there will be a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the social issues which are being dealt with in that legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now the Leader of the Opposition in this Parliament will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the very proposal which he enunciated in the amendment which he read to the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In looking at the report of the Senate debate I find that on 10 May 1973 the Labor Party broke a firm arrangement about pairs in order to win a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the Government which, knowing that the arrangement had been made, had allowed  Senator Gair,  its pawn, to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Senate as a senator knowing that he had accepted a post but thinking quite correctly at that time that this did not yet imply his resignation from the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said: ‘It is not the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the House that matters, it is the fact of lying ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any objection to the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken the honourable member could have called for a division, but he did not do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although it is not appropriate to stray too far from the Bills under discussion this evening, let me remind you,  Mr Speaker,  that the Queensland Premier saved himself by his own proxy <span class="highlight">vote</span> some time ago when his Party wished to cast him out as Leader. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A full debate on the proposal took place and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken on whether the community supported a health centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he confer with the Foreign Minister with a view to ensuring that the Australian view is asserted more positively on questions affecting the Middle East and that, in particular, we <span class="highlight">vote</span> as well as speak in line with our clearly established principles? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable gentlemen wish to have the precise text and votes, then I would ask them to put questions on notice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take it that the honourable gentleman is referring to the main resolution on the rights of the Palestinians on which a <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken on 2 1 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To stand in contemplation of having a leisurely- I do not use that term lightly- Committee debate on this Bill is not something that would fill one with encouragement after the recent performance in the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of this House just a few moments ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the honourable gentleman would recognise that there is no virtue in seeking to dragoon members of his Party or, indeed, to attempt to do so in respect of members of this side of the House by saying: ‘<span class="highlight">Vote</span> for the Bill without having an opportunity to consider all of the proposals in detail’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Senate election was nothing short of an international disgrace when we had to wait so long before we could tell the rest of the world which party would govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They worked out that it resulted in an increase in the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> of 0.5 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members should look at the results in New South Wales of the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the Senate election and see where the highest informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only does such a system deny 12 per cent of the people of New South Wales a <span class="highlight">vote</span> but also the vast majority of those people live in Labor electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Australian Country Party, to a lesser extent, ought to be interested because where people are unable to obtain how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> also rises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are penalising people throughout Australia largely on a class basis in relation to their rights to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the upper House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be an informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent throughout Australia for the House of Representatives and between 10 per cent and 2 1 per cent at a Senate election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it difficult to understand why honourable members opposite try to justify such a system and why they are prepared to tell people in their electorates that the differential of 8 per cent, or 9 per cent, or 1 5 per cent of people who <span class="highlight">vote</span> informally between the elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate can be justified by saying: ‘That is all right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the electorate of Sydney, which has a 78 per cent preferred <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Australian Labor Party, there was a 20 per cent informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Senate election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then one is getting down to a 5.6 per cent informal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may mean, of course, as it turned out in May 1 974, that the Labor Party was denied a majority in the Senate, not because people did not want it but because of the system, because of the informal votes for Senate candidates cast in the safe Labor electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the electorates of Sydney; Grayndler, the seat of the Minister for Services and Property; Hunter; Chifley; Newcastle and Cunningham- it will be a long time before the Liberal Party holds any of these electorates- the proportions of informal votes were: 20 per cent, 1 6 per cent, 1 5 per cent, 1 4 per cent, 1 4 per cent, and 1 1 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thousands and thousands of voters throughout New South Wales were denied their rights not because they did not want to <span class="highlight">vote</span> formally, not because they did not want to understand for whom they were voting- they wanted a Labor Government, which they returned in the House of Representatives- but because people were exploiting the system, the old archiac system by which if there are 73 candidates one has to <span class="highlight">vote</span> one to seventy three. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-If they wanted to <span class="highlight">vote</span> informally for the Senate it is difficult to understand that they did not want to <span class="highlight">vote</span> informally for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the people today are a different generation from those who voted 20 or 30 years ago and if one looks at the system in other years it throws up the same result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wherever there is a large number of candidates, as evidenced by all the analyses that have been done, especially the very expert analysis by the Department of Services and Property and by an observer, Malcolm Mackerras, there is a larger informal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps one knows for whom one votes first and second but from then on it is a guess to make sure that one numbers the ballot from one to seventy three and that nothing happens in the meantime to make it an informal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people who do not want to go to that trouble and who want to <span class="highlight">vote</span> only for the number of candidates required- in the case of a double dissolution, 10 candidates for the Senate and one for the House of Representatives- may <span class="highlight">vote</span> depending upon their likes and dislikes of political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Give us a list of those people who had a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the last House of Representatives election or the last Senate election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are saying that the electoral officers or their representatives should go to those places and the people should <span class="highlight">vote</span> and put their ballot paper straight in the box. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the present system we must wait 10 days after an election for postal votes to come in, so that we have speculation in the newspapers every day about which Party is going to govern Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We see news stories to the effect that there are six more votes to come from New Zealand, five more to come from Coolangatta, two more to come from the United Kingdom, seven more to come from France or somewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The strongest argument that one can use in putting forward the view that this optional preferential system should be adopted is not that it gives anybody an unfair advantage because it does not, and it is not that it cannot be followed because it is a simple system of voting for the number of people that are required in the ballot, while still allowing a voter to go on to give an exhaustive <span class="highlight">vote</span> if he wants to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The strongest proposition that one can put forward in this chamber is that the present system is being exploited to the detriment of the voters themselves because they are not getting the government they voted for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the May 1974 Senate election the government that the people got was the result of the number of candidates who stood in New South Wales, because 12 per cent of the voters in that State were disfranchised under the system which operates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The votes of hundreds of thousands of voters were not counted because of the system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost all of those people, I would say, would <span class="highlight">vote</span> only for the team they wanted and perhaps one other if we introduced the system that is part of the amendments which have been moved by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Port Adelaide thought it was an absurdity to wait for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> registered by Australians in France, Britain or somewhere else to proceed in Australia before the result of an election could be determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> was one of the democratic rights of every Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under our system people are compelled to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, therefore they have a right to record a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe every democratic Australian should insist on his right to record a <span class="highlight">vote</span> irrespective of what country he is in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, it will reduce the real choice of the people by the range of parties which they are able to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for at an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rarely in a multiple party system does the final <span class="highlight">vote</span> on first past the post voting bring with it a majority of votes for the party which is elected to government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How many times, particularly in recent years, has a British government been elected with more than 40 per cent of the primary <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the votes for the Liberal Party in Britain where up to 20 per cent of the people have voted for that Party in recent elections, 20 per cent of the people of Britain are virtually disenfranchised because of first past the post voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that the system is less democratic because there is very rarely, if ever, a 50 per cent <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the government there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one considers the present system in Australia where preferences are distributed, at the last elections the party that gained the greatest percentage of votes- it amounted to more than 50 per cent- is now in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With first past the post voting and multiple parties the chance of having a government elected on the majority of votes is reduced dramatically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government does not like the present system of voting, which is not preferential voting but really should be called the alternative voting system because one’s alternative choice has the same voting capacity as the original choice, why does it not put forward some other system, such as a simple preferential system in which the second <span class="highlight">vote</span> is worth half the first <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this system we add the numbers given to the votes for each candidate and the person with the lowest number is elected because he has the highest number of first or second preferences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I agree that people should not be expected to <span class="highlight">vote</span> Nos. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, if the Government is sincere in its desire to have electoral amendments on a genuine basis rather than for a Party political reason, it will defer a final <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this legislation until the beginning of the autumn session so that there may be adequate time to consider all the implications of the BUI. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Seventy per cent of people who <span class="highlight">vote</span> in elections at present cast second, third and fourth preference votes which are never counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose one could say that in a marginal seat 40 per cent would <span class="highlight">vote</span> Liberal and 40 per cent would <span class="highlight">vote</span> Labor no matter what happens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people who <span class="highlight">vote</span> one for the Labor candidate and those people who <span class="highlight">vote</span> one for the Liberal candidate know full well that when they fill in 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 alongside the names of the respective candidates those preferences will never be counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not sensible and efficient to say: ‘In those cases, people may <span class="highlight">vote</span> No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If they want to give their first <span class="highlight">vote</span> to the Australia Party candidate and their second <span class="highlight">vote</span> to the Labor Party candidate or the Liberal Party candidate, they have the option to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely no party which claims that it supports the principle of freedom of choice can say: ‘We compel you to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in order of preference for candidates whether you want to or not’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe also that reduction of the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> is desirable because it will significantly reduce the time taken in counting the ballot papers, in counting the votes, in determining the result of an election, and that is important in a democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all know that there are ways of nullifying postal votes taken in hospitals and rest homes and elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is equally true that every effort must be made to ensure that all citizens exercise their right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in secrecy and that that <span class="highlight">vote</span> is counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that honourable members opposite would suggest that we should introduce that system here, but, in essence, that is the best system of all because on 2 separate occasions if a candidate does not get an absolute majority of primary votes on the first count people are forced to direct their minds to making a decision as to which of the three or four or whatever the number of candidates is they will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are they a little worried that in the next election they will not be able to get enough of their supporters outside the polling booths handing out how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To compel people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and then to reduce their opportunities for casting their votes is, I think, an extremely odd form of electoral justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Postal votes are almost exclusively preserved for Liberal candidates in the electorates around Brisbane that I know of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should have the opportunity once again to cast a democratic <span class="highlight">vote</span> without the surveillance of party scrutineers and without the watchful eye of the Liberal Party canvassers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let me assure honourable members that I could in fact name the individual who visited several nursing homes in my electorate before the last election on 1 8 May and told people in the homes: ‘You must <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Liberal candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You must ensure that your <span class="highlight">vote</span> is cast for the Liberal candidate because your future existence in this nursing home, where you are so comfortable, where you are so well looked after and where you know that you have got security of existence, is threatened if you return the Labor candidate and if he is part of a Labor Government returned to Canberra ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He believed that the Labor Party had supremacy as far as the collection of postal votes were concerned in his electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has changed to the extent that the Liberal Party in Griffith during the last election campaign was prepared to advertise in local newspapers and was prepared to solicit postal votes from people in the electorate of Griffith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some advertisements were worded: ‘Do you need a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>, electors of Griffith? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You may obtain a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the election to be held on 18 May’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advertisements went on and gave reasons for the elector to have a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it was soliciting postal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He may not even know about the postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> application forms that are prepared many months prior to the election in order to be sent out on his behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It aimed at allowing people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> precisely as they do now under the same conditions- there were minor amendments to the present voting method at the end of the paper but we will leave them aside- or to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for one candidate and no more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His party’s preference would be superimposed on that one <span class="highlight">vote</span> by the particular electoral officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the basis that it has, my scheme aims to superimpose the entire preferential voting pattern of a candidate on to the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the elector who votes for that candidate only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is hardly a rational situation when the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young)  points to the impossibility of a Labor <span class="highlight">vote</span> being properly exercised under the present scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, I do not think that one ought to worry very much in relation to whether people do want to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for an individual specifically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think that it has been one of the conditions of the Electoral Act for the lower House for some time that voters do not have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the last person whose name is shown on a voting paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite ridiculous that people who do not want to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Communist team in fact have to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was strange how many people voted first for the Liberal Party, went right through the card and completely ignored the Communist Party because it happened to be No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An electoral system is fair only if the most incapable person eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span> is able to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> with ease, without fear and without having it denied to him by the system in practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a party, person or government seeks, by legal means, to deny a disadvantaged section of the community its voting rights this can be achieved by placing complications or difficulties in the way of voting which will prevent a substantial proportion of the population from casting formal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last Senate election a deliberate nomination of candidates took place in New South Wales for the purpose of creating informal votes- in your electorate,  Mr Speaker,  20 per cent of the votes cast for the Senate were informalto the advantage of a political party which suffers least from the casting of informal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-It was because of the difficulty of casting a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for 73 candidates in New South Wales and 46 candidates in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am saying is that there are underprivileged people in this community who did not have the opportunity to go to a private college as the honourable member did, persons who have not had all the benefits of a big farm to live on and the advantage of plenty of time available to them, who are not quite capable of casting a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and who went into the polling booths in the last election scared to death of casting an informal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These people are entitled to have their <span class="highlight">vote</span> the same as your supporters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You would also seek to deny them the full value of their <span class="highlight">vote</span> by giving your friends, supposedly disadvantaged millionaire farmers, 2 votes to their one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>You are denying the people their right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-What he said was that people without education are not entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are a number of provisions in this Bill which will, I believe, assist electors to cast valid votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, after all, the important thing- giving electors an opportunity to cast valid votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not, as some members do, sneer at people who have not the capacity to cast a valid <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Casting a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, for some people, is a situation of stress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are people who actually cast their own votes without assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are people who do not get the benefit of how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> cards, especially if they want to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a minority party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people in fact <span class="highlight">vote</span> under situations of stress and are likely to make mistakes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the existing situation, if a person voting in New South Wales at the last election had correctly numbered his Senate card from 1 to 7 1 and had repeated or left out one of the last three numberseven though it might have been for a candidate who had less than 100 votes in the State and would have been the first eliminated; therefore the order of preferences would have made no difference at all to his <span class="highlight">vote</span>, it would not have been counted- that person’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> was wiped out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that it is far more likely that DLP voters would follow a party ticket and cast a preferential <span class="highlight">vote</span> than it is that persons voting for the Australia Party would indicate a preference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation with regard to the Senate under the proposed system would be that in all but a very small number of cases the number of votes required to be cast would cover the candidates elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The putting of the names of parties on ballot papers and the registration for that purpose of party names is a simplification of the systems which would give those people who do not get the benefit of how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> cards some benefit in that  they  would know what candidates stood for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope u would also in time lead to cessation of the distribution of how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if we must have howtovote cards there should be some more simple way of using them than giving out 60,000, 180,000 or 200,000 in each electorate on an election day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a complete waste of resources to be printing useless how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest that any system which makes it easier for people to identify and <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the candidate or the parties which they choose is a system which advances the rights of people in a democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A system of electing people to the national Parliament can only be judged by the capacity which it provides for the person least capable of casting a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to cast, without fear, a formal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That those people who tend to <span class="highlight">vote</span> Labor are the most disadvantaged by a complicated electoral system is an accident which this Government’s education policies, I hope, will shortly overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the facts are that people are disadvantaged and are placed under stress by electoral laws which require them to undertake a too complicated system of voting, especially in Senate elections, and I believe that these amendments will assist greatly in simplifying the system so that all people will have their democratic right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and <span class="highlight">vote</span> formally, and will not have it taken away from them on a mere pointless technicality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I was amazed to hear the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes)  admit earlier in his remarks that the Australian Labor Party voters throughout Australia have not been educated to the same extent as the people who <span class="highlight">vote</span> the other way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If optional preferential voting is what the Labor Party calls a democratic <span class="highlight">vote</span>, all I can say is that it is horribly like democratic socialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, if the honourable member for Corio is correct, people cannot count up to 4, 5 or 6 as they would be required to do if casting a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Angas  (Mr Giles)  mentioned, this raises the question as to whether those people are really entitled to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not sure what is meant by ‘an earlier deadline for the return of postal votes and for the return of postal votes direct to respective returning officers’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this mean that postal votes will have to be returned to all returning officers by the close of the poll? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also proposed to increase the fine for people who do not cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my mind the proposal for the return of postal votes is completely impractical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister points out that the <span class="highlight">vote</span> must be made before the closing of the poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are many country electorates where it takes literally days to get a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> to a particular constituent and back again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How in the name of fortune will these people lodge their votes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another provision refers to prohibiting the listing of names of persons who apply for postal votes, except in specified circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot see any reason for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be made public so I support that proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the non-provision of such votes could be classified as one of the penalties of serving a sentence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Protection of candidates against the issue of misleading how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards is another amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The way in which this Bill is being put makes it very hard for a lot of people to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the event of an emergency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to demonstrate the alleged simplicity of the system there would be those who to serve their own political interests may require the Electoral Officer to promote the idea that the most effective <span class="highlight">vote</span> is a <span class="highlight">vote</span> given to only one candidate where subsequent preferences are ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that we should adopt a system which makes it as easy as possible for all voters to make their intentions known, but, in doing so, we should strive for a system that results in the election of those candidates who are both favoured or preferred by most of the electorate and not disapproved of by the majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A simplified preferential system, which I advocate, permits a candidate to register his how-to- <span class="highlight">vote</span> card so that a voter, by placing a <span class="highlight">vote</span> beside, say, a Liberal Party candidate, would have his <span class="highlight">vote</span> counted in accordance with the Liberal Party’s how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> card. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a system would enable all voters, whether they are supporters of major parties or minor parties, to use a form of shorthand to follow the party ticket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A form of simplified voting such as this would tend to minimise the impact of the so-called donkey <span class="highlight">vote</span>, as these unthinking voters, on becoming aware that they need number only one square for an effective <span class="highlight">vote</span>, would not then blindly number down the card. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The procedure needed to permit the registration of how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards would not, contrary to an earlier interjection made by the Minister, pose insurmountable difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is already done in South Australia under a scheme sponsored by a Labor government for the purpose of public display of how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards in each polling booth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to aiding the voter, the system would greatly assist electoral officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an optional preferential system most, if not all, political parties would undoubtedly find it expedient to issue how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards indicating voting preferences beyond their own candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances the counting of votes would be complicated by the need to check the votes for accuracy and the number of informal votes might not be significantly reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under a simplified preferential system 75 to 80 per cent of voters would use the shorthand method of indicating their preferences where they were in accord with their party’s recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These votes would be easy to check and easy to count. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of preferences to be distributed would in a significant number of cases be distributable in accordance with the registered how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> card, and these votes could be separately counted and their prospective destination brought into account in making assessments as to the result of the election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these instances the result would be available without it being necessary for other preference votes to be individually scrutinised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as speed of finalising the result is desirable, this method of voting would go a long way towards achieving this goal without either depriving the electors of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> or impairing their present right to express shades of opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we turn to the amendments which are designed to alter the circumstances in which postal votes are to be submitted we find that their effect is to reduce the franchise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To achieve this by depriving thousands of Australians of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is too high a price to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some States there were public holidays after the weekend on which the election was held and, as a consequence, there was a significant rise in absentee and postal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any change in the law should be aimed at making it easier, not more difficult, for people to record their votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, with regard to postal voting, there is a need to amend the law to minimise the opportunity for malpractice, it should be done in a manner which does not effectively disfranchise large numbers of voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument that the law as to postal votes needs to be changed to allow for a speedier finalisation of results is a specious one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no more difficulty for a government in office to administer the affairs of the nation until a count of votes is completed than there is for it to do so during the election campaign itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If speed in the finalisation of election results involves a reduction in the opportunities of every elector to have his <span class="highlight">vote</span> taken into account, it should be opposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the present law a person who is interstate on the day of an election may <span class="highlight">vote</span> by means of a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> at an interstate polling booth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His right to such a <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be exercised only if he can get an application for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to his own divisional returning officer by 6 p.m. on the Thursday preceding the election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then if he gets a <span class="highlight">vote</span> his <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be counted only if he returns it not to any divisional returning officer but to his own divisional returning officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In each instance the tightening of the time limits imposed for the lodging of postal votes have the effect of depriving people of their franchise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For years the Australian Labor Party has espoused support for the view that all votes should have an equal value, yet in a most hypocritical fashion it proposes a law which is designed to prevent people from having a say in the determination of the government in their country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, as I mentioned earlier, this offer of the right to enrolment should not be given with the one hand and taken away with the other by making the attainment and achievement of a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> so difficult that relatively few such persons will be able to register a formal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The retention on the rolls of the name of an elector who, though temporarily absent, retains a real place of living in the subdivision for which he is enrolled, the protection of candidates against the issue of misleading how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards and a number of other amendments commend themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight the Opposition will divide this House and <span class="highlight">vote</span> against those amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But now that a Labor Government has introduced them, like a lot of donkeys, the Opposition will line up and <span class="highlight">vote</span> against proposals which it endorsed and we would have supported at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight the honourable member for Gwydir will walk into this House and <span class="highlight">vote</span> against 16 of the proposals which, as the then Minister, he asked the Parliament of Australia to endorse and which we, as the then Opposition, would have endorsed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition will <span class="highlight">vote</span> tonight against that one reform, which in 1971 lapsed on the expiration and dissolution of that Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight they will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against every proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should people anywhere in this country, in this enlightened age, be asked to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for seventy or eighty candidates? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is wrong with the system where they <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the number of candidates equal to the number of vacancies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people say that one needs only to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for one candidate to have a formal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It only adds to the number of informal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any party which can get members in this House with from 17 per cent to 30 per cent of the formal <span class="highlight">vote</span> ought to support the system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should not any party which can return the Queensland Premier with 19 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> go along with the system? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight by voting against these proposals honourable members opposite are denying a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to people working abroad in the government service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They want to allow the rigged postal voting system to continue where those who are the most apt or earnest, as the case may be according to their political convictions shall sway the <span class="highlight">vote</span> irrespective of what the wishes of the people might be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He wants all the reforms in the world as long as he does not have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now the Country Party says it is undemocratic for the people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the national Parliament between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 wonder, if this had been a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>, how many honourable members opposite would support these proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  sincerely believe that the Queensland method of regimenting postal votes is democratic in State and Federal politics in Queensland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland members of this Parliament who intend to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the mobile polling arrangements are voting against the system that is in force in their own State and against the system that is in force in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have adopted 16 of its amendments, 16 basic points of its policy, yet the member who introduced them is going to sit on the Opposition side tonight and <span class="highlight">vote</span> against me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight we will pleasantly look at members of the Country Party, and every Opposition member who was here prior to the last election, <span class="highlight">vote</span> against their own proposals simply because they have been introduced by a Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Optional preferential voting will give to the people of Australia the opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> without there being a waste of countless thousands of informal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The introduction of mobile polling booths will bring to people who are sick, aged and infirm the opportunity to cast democratic votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also introduces closing of the polls at 6 p.m. Every Queenslander has voted under that system for more than a generation and what is wrong with it in this modern age? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should not postal votes be in on the night of the election? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can tell the people of this country that in the last election Labor lost a seat on postal votes because a lot of people voted after 8 o ‘clock on the night in question but signed that they had voted before that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a person wants a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> why should he not put it into the ballot box before the close of the poll at 8 p.m. on election night? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is innocent until proven guilty and consequently should be able to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, This happens throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then they would realise why they should have voted to prevent people voting under their names. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About 50 per cent of these propositions are Country Party proposals, and that made it pretty hard for me to support them, but tonight we find that honourable members opposite are going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now they are going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> blindly against the proposals in this Bill the vast majority of which are their own proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Country Party did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for those proposals tonight when they were brought in from this side of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have liked to have heard the Leader of the Country Party say how he told members of the Liberal Party to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this or else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are lots of people, intelligent and unintelligent, who would like not to have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for 73 candidates or 48 candidates, as the case may be, but only for the 5, 6, 8 or 10 candidates of their choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We categorise it for what it is- an endeavour to hold up the democratic process of this country and a classic example to the people of Australia of members of the Opposition who are too lazy to read a Bill and who voted against their own proposals because they did not know what to do on the issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite voted tonight against 16 proposals which they introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Gwydir came to this Parliament and asked it to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the 16 proposals and now,  2lA  years later, asks it to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the same proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today, when the Opposition moves a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of censure in the Government, the Prime Minister does not even have the decency to come into the House to answer it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in reply- Before a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken on this matter I would like to mention one or two points that have been raised in the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let the people of Australia clearly see that those supporters of the Government who are peddling the propaganda around their electorates that they are not in favour of this move and have spoken in this place against it will sit on the Government side in complete unanimity and will <span class="highlight">vote</span> to support this Bill when a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are asking honourable members opposite to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for our amendment to increase the loan from $9,000 to $ 1 5,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The domestic price of sugar in Australia is the lowest in the world for which I believe the sugar industry is entitled to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of thanks from everybody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the curiosity of the Standing Orders we were in the position where committee members on one side of the House could appoint the  chairman,  but the  chairman  would not have a deliberative <span class="highlight">vote</span> and so committee members from the other side of the House would actually have a majority of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, if the Government appointed the  chairman,  the 2 members of the Liberal Party and the one member of the Country Party would represent 3 votes and there would be only 2 votes from the Government side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me, that did not matter; I do not think that there will be a <span class="highlight">vote</span> necessary in the committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My expectation is that the committee ought to be able to proceed without there ever needing to be a single <span class="highlight">vote</span> on any issue, because the goodwill of all the members of the committee ought to determine a matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the many years of Labor government in Queensland, no Labor government ever governed on a <span class="highlight">vote</span> as small as the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on which the Country Party occupies the majority position in the Queensland Government at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has only to look at the votes attracted by Labor leaders like the late  Mr Forgan-Smith,  the late honourable E. M. Hanlon and ex-Senator Gair, at whom members of the Opposition were sneering in the course of the contribution made a few minutes ago by the honourable member for Gippsland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to deal specifically with postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> malpractices in nursing homes in Brisbane to the advantage to the Liberal Parry, and particularly in my area of experience in the Brisbane Federal Division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that there are a number of nursing homes in the metropolitan area of Brisbane where the Liberal Party receives privileged access in terms of applying for postal votes or electoral visitor votes in the State election campaign and in distributing how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards and pamphlets and in actually placing people on the roll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall the honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron)  talking about postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> malpractices on many occasions in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe that people who are aged and ill should be just as entitled to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the party of their own choice as they were when they formerly occupied their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one sends scrutineers with the electoral visitor or the mobile booth system- this is a proposal in the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill 1974 which was passed by this House on Monday of this week- applies we all realise that the scrutineers are not able to distribute how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that families who have their elderly friends or relations in nursing homes should make sure that those people, whatever their choice of <span class="highlight">vote</span> might be, are given the opportunity of lodging a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the parry of their choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a party other than the Labor Party, then that is their choice and I respect that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is a serious situation when many elderly people can have their votes manipulated in the interests of the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact, at the last election I doubled my <span class="highlight">vote</span> at one of their polling booths. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For years I had been getting only 2 votes out of eighty-seven, and at the last election I got four. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be regarded as a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of censure by the Government of the Corporation and must damage the goodwill, respect and liaison which the Corporation has built up with most sections of the wool industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aspect of the Bill that concerns me even more is that to which the honourable member for Canning  (Mr Bungey),  who preceded me, has already adverted- that is, the degree to which the changes in the membership of the Corporation can be seen by some who heard the Minister for Northern Development and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro  (Mr Whan)  speak in this House on another occasion as being a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence in the members of the Wool Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we are concerned that these changes to the membership of the Corporation might be seen as a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence in the present membership, it is our intention during the Committee stage of this debate to move for the deletion of that part of this legislation which provides for such changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cabinet is looking at it, and Parliament will have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it before you can say ‘wool ‘s gone ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not have many but there are plenty of woolly people in Canberra and they do not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not dependent on graziers for my <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the quite unnecessary provisions of the new legislation is that for the new member provided for in this clause because it is virtually a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence in the present members of the Australian Wool Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore feel sure that honourable members will have ample material in the form of explanation and comment on the Bill to decide their attitudes, and to <span class="highlight">vote</span> accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sitting up in the back of the chamber is an honourable member who was elected on 26 per cent of the primary <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is possible for  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  to win on Saturday- and that seems very doubtful- he can put it down not to the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Australian people but to the rigged boundaries under the Country Party, which continually criticises this Government’s reforms and will not give effect to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the purposes of this Act, a reference to control of the exercise of the right to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in respect of a share in a company to which this Act applies, or to control of the exercise of the right to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in respect of a share in any other corporation, shall be read as including a reference to control of that right that is direct or indirect, including control that is exercisable- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, although the Fund receives about $60m to $70m in contributions from its members, the members are not entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is not surprising since the people who are elected decide who will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not appropriate that it be introduced at a time when any change in the membership might seem as though there is a <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Corporation itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He will find in the months and perhaps the years that lie ahead that he will have even more to complain about because on that sort of performance if he continues to ask the people of Australia to elect him as Prime Minister he is going to be more disappointed still because he will find even fewer people are prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for such a policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition claimed in 1974 that ‘this referendum will make the Senate a rubber stamp of a socialist, centralist Labor Government’ and that ‘the Government is being deceitful- the question you will <span class="highlight">vote</span> on does not explain the real proposed law’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Opposition to the proposals contained in the Bills can be read only as a <span class="highlight">vote</span> against what practically every Australian proclaims as desirable objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that on matters such as the Family Law Bill, where there is a conscience <span class="highlight">vote</span> and such marked division within the Labor Party, there will be adequate time for debate but I wish to goodness that the precedent the Leader of the House is setting on the debate on the Family Law Bill were to be followed in other matters of significance where those of us on this side of the House, representing as we do half the Australian electorate at least and I believe a good deal more than half at present, would be given an opportunity- not just the principal spokesman in our Parties but those who are on the back bench representing their electorates- to get up and canvass the views and matters which their constituents wish them to canvass. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can see merit in the suggestion and if the wording were altered to relate to ‘residents of Darwin’ instead of ‘persons entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at elections for the Legislative Assembly for the Territory’ that possibly would fill the bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps one could say they are those criticisms which are so weighty that if one held them- and I do not- one would have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Bill rather than concern oneself with amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As honourable members are to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on non-Party lines it seems unlikely that the Bill which emerges from this House will be precisely the same as the Bill which emerged from the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>An honourable member who bases his judgment and his <span class="highlight">vote</span> simply on the volume of mail that he receives in his office has surely reached the time when he should stop and look at himself to determine whether he is a person worthy to continue in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter has come to a stage where those who believe that some changes in our divorce laws are necessary have no alternative but to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the amendment proposed and hope that common sense will prevail in the Committee stage of the debate if there are areas and there are in which changes should be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am now referring to the primary <span class="highlight">vote</span> only and not to the preferences that were counted as a result of three or four cornered contests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it any wonder that the people of Australia are now having second thoughts about where they will cast their <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the next election? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The incidence of press releases issued by the Special Minister of State is not high enough to warrant isolating costs from the total <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While a voter is free to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> by secret ballot under this Bill he will not be free to support in an anonymous way the political party of his choosing or a candidate belonging to that political party because his financial contribution, if he wishes to support his <span class="highlight">vote</span> in that way, will be available for public scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the members of this House will have sufficient confidence in themselves and the Australian electorate to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a measure which will take away from elections in Australia, from governments in Australia, the continued innuendo which must follow if substantial contributions to election funds are reputed to be from sources which could receive substantial benefits in return. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yes, but we just do not get the opportunity because Labor voters get only one <span class="highlight">vote</span> and Country Party voters in Queensland get five. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It believes that people who live in the cities are not entitled to a full <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One is flat out raising enough money in one’s electorate to put out how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards and pamphlets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, because the advertising agents tell us that the best way in which to persuade someone to buy a particular commodity or to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a political party is by way of 30- second scatters, we are putting on all the nonsense in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person like John Singleton and all his mates can march up to a political party and say: ‘If you want to win this election this is the way to do it: Forget about telling someone for 10 minutes that you have a good policy on a peace zone in the Indian Ocean or that you support equal rights for women because that is not the way in which to win votes’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 30- second advertisement is not only nonsense but also the most expensive way of advertising because it has to be played on a lot more occasions than would have been the case under the old system when television was first introduced into Australia and everything produced by the political parties was done in terms of explaining policies to members of the public and allowing them to judge logically which was the best party to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I may go out, as we all may go out, to raise money for how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards, pamphlets, and a slide to be shown at the local drive-in, but they really have little effect on how people may <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the electorate in which that is done; they are going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the national issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government, not long after it took power in 1972, gave 18-year-olds the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal  Party  is Australia’s largest free enterprise and non-socialist Party, and the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on 7 December confirmed this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We even had a situation at the time of the 1974 double dissolution campaign where a very large sum of money was spent on behalf of the Australian Electoral Office, designed to reduce the volume of the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sum was expended for one reason- to reduce the volume of the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we all know that the Australian Labor Party was petrified that the volume of the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> would cause it to lose ground in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Along with the principles for which the Australian Labor Party has fought of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, the easing of voting procedures and the facilitating of results to express the wish of the people, the Government now wishes to bring in legislation that will enact 2 demands by the public- for the limitation of electoral expenditure and for public disclosure of the source of funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> cards which would cost about $ 1,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dear oh dear, the Minister would not even need to hand out a how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> card in his electorate and he would still win the election handsomely because he holds a blue ribbon Labor seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people in that electorate do not know how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> any different way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should also say that the Government accepts, and began the proceedings on, the basis that there is to be a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> to enable honourable members both here and in the Senate to express their wishes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can understand his position and, were he to go some way along the road which will be contained in the amendments to the Bill- some of which I will propose- I would assume to have his <span class="highlight">vote</span> in support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you want to ask about the present Act, let me tell you that I voted against aspects of the Barwick legislation and if they are repeated I am going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against them again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important that people ought to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for or against this amendment according to their beliefs and more importantly I think that after having defeated the amendment they should deal with the actual contents of the Bill in the Committee stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should <span class="highlight">vote</span> for or against certain propositions if they really believe in them but not because a vocal pressure group tries to stand over them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me conclude by appealing to honourable members to <span class="highlight">vote</span> according to their beliefs and not to give in to pressure from the Festival of Light or the clergy who are professionally employed by their churches to impose their beliefs on the rest of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The majority of people reading the proposal upon which they were asked to <span class="highlight">vote</span> would look at it and say: ‘ Well, there is very considerable merit in this, having both of the Houses of Parliament elected at the same time’, little realising, of course, that the proposal to be put into the Constitution related to almost a hideously confused set of provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is convenient, said the Government, for the people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Senate at the same time as they <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the fact that he was floored for the political full count by the honourable Joh Bjelke-Petersen in the recent Queensland State elections- I liked the remarks of the honourable member for Corio when he said that they were democratic elections, and I thank him for that admission and for the accuracy of his political comment and that he was defeated by a majority of 3.75 million votes to 3.5 million votes on 18 May last, on his own admission, on the self same referendum issues he now seeks to introduce the proposal again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He claims a mandate for this and for that, but he never ever states that his Government is a minority government which attracted only 49.3 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the last election, a decline of .3 per cent in 1 8 months and the loss of a number of seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We submit that it is both unnecessary and unwanted and we ask the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to accept the democratic <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Australian people, who told him in no uncertain manner that they do not want a bar of this type of legislation and they will not stand his meddling in the affairs of substance in a way which interferes with their basic rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was stated in the document setting out the case for a No’ <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the last referendum- with the greatest of respect to those who drafted it, a completely dishonest document- that it is easy to bring about a conjoint election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought a decisive defeat on the popular <span class="highlight">vote</span> and a loss in 5 of the 6 States of Australia ought to have been a clear enough indication to the Government of Australia that the people did not want this change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government seek to put up a proposition to the people and see how vigorously the Opposition opposes the right of the Government even to let the people <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be remembered that the Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill which  Sir Reginald  Swartz introduced on 16 April 1970 never came to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in that Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a change of Prime Minister and the only thing upon which the various factions of the Liberal Party and its colleague, the Country Party, could agree was to stall a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We took many procedural actions in 1970, 1971 and 1972 to secure a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Bill, but the Bill was not brought on for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Parliament which ended in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members of the parties which would not allow the matter to come to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the 1969-72 Parliament are now asking that the matter be further delayed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, and most importantly- I hope the Opposition will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this Bill and try to deprive the community of this provision- the Bill provides for the Australian Government to assume liability for nursing home benefits at present paid by registered hospital benefit funds to insured non-pensioner patients. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members from Queensland in this place and in the other place will be asked to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where an amalgamation is submitted to a ballot or ballots in accordance with this Part, the amalgamation shall be taken to be approved if, in the ballot, or each of the ballots, if more than one, more than one-half of the members who duly record formal votes <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of the amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall speak only briefly to the amendments because much of the second reading debate was devoted to them or the substance of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the amendments is to make sure that those who might be in favour of a change and those who might be opposed to a change would have a free and fair opportunity of stating their case and also to make sure that each indivdual in the trade union would have a free and equal opportunity of casting a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He wants to establish the circumstances in which five or seven people out of 10 000 can <span class="highlight">vote</span> a trade union out of existence and he wants to establish the circumstances in which the proponents of change can state their case but the opponents of change have no equal opportunity of stating their objections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A copy of the scheme of amalgamation submitted under this Part or, if the scheme has been amended in accordance with this Part, of the scheme as so amended, shall accompany each ballot paper sent to a person entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the Ballot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>more than one-half of the members who record formal votes on those ballot papers <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of the amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> of such members must be free from intimidation and they must be based upon maximum information both for and against the merger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That amendment does provide adequate protection for the rank and file members to receive ballot papers and information regarding the amalgamation proposals and to <span class="highlight">vote</span> by secret postal ballot if they choose to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides that the union rules must provide for an absentee <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone requesting an absentee <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be thought by the union officials to be thinking along rather different lines from the recommendations of the union officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is: Why bother to force 250 members to identify themselves and lay themselves open to intimidation when in fact it would be simple, it would be equitable and it would be most just and fair to send all members of the union a ballot paper together with a simple statement for and against the proposed merger so that they could, if they wished, <span class="highlight">vote</span> in accordance with their own wishes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member said that a 30 per cent <span class="highlight">vote</span> is a good result for a trade union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know of no case where a registered union has ever refused a member the right to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> recorded by secret postal ballot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He diverted from talking about an Amalgamated Metal Workers Union controlled ballot, where people have a right to apply for an absent <span class="highlight">vote</span>, to the question of 250 people having a right to apply to the Industrial Registrar for an Australian Electoral Office controlled ballot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If anyone in the AMWU is game to apply for an absent <span class="highlight">vote</span>, his name goes on a roll as having applied for an absent <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only people in the AMWU who apply for an absent <span class="highlight">vote</span> are people who are not going to turn up at the star nights- that is their term, not mine- because at the star night, if a person does not <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the way the heirarchy wants him to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, members of the heirarchy can take his name out of an upturned hat and have a look at it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know how a person voted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone in the AMWU who applies for an absent <span class="highlight">vote</span> has his name put on a list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the absent votes come in one after the other against the ruling junta in the AMWU at the time, the names of the persons who made those absent votes are known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other provision which indicates that there will be no <span class="highlight">vote</span> in relation to union matters or no <span class="highlight">vote</span> in relation to union officials for 3 years after an amalgamation would seem to be an especially unreasonable one simply because there will be no protection for rank and file members of a trade union along the road to amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simplest way to frustrate it is not to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it hard to believe that, if unions were keen enough on amalgamation, they could not get 5 1 per cent of their members to record a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say again that it is not unreasonable to expect, if unionists are keen on amalgamation, that 5 1 per cent would <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the issue or on any other issue in which they were keenly involved and interested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the main areas of concern over the Minister’s proposals, if not the critical one, is the amendment that he desires to make in regard to the number of members of an organisation who must <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of an amalgamation before that can be brought about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worthwhile pointing out that under the existing legislation onehalf of the membership must <span class="highlight">vote</span> and there must be a majority of that one-half before the amalgamation can be approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Minister’s proposal all that is required is a majority of the members who <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That cannot possibly be so if simply a majority of those members who <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of an amalgamation are allowed to force amalgamation on all the members of the union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not proposed on that day to take any <span class="highlight">vote</span>, even if the debate should conclude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is desired- to give every honourable member an opportunity of taking part in the final <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as I am concerned and as far as the Government is concerned, no <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be taken on that day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the debate concludes on the Friday- there is no guarantee that it will, of course- I can assure honourable members that no snap <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been our decision that should something like that occur the <span class="highlight">vote</span> should be recommitted because every honourable member should have the opportunity on a normal sitting day to participate in the final <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One does meet difficulties in this matter because the evidence that I shall bring before the House will show that all members of the Government Party are involved in this particular crime and they would therefore be ineligible to sit on the committee investigating it or indeed to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the motion in regard to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When they go to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> they imagine that they are going to put into office a particular personality to represent them, a man who by his character and his attributes has the sorts of things to offer that they appreciate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look strictly at the motion which has been moved, it is an unsubstantiated allegation that in votes taken in this House honourable members have been subjected to somebody else’s direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, no evidence at all was given of any particular <span class="highlight">vote</span> which was contrary to the manner in which an honourable member wanted to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not let us have accusations and allegations that honourable members have voted here as a result of a direction given by somebody else and that they did not intend to <span class="highlight">vote</span> the way they did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though we might not have done so well in the recent Queensland State election we still polled 36 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> as compared with the National Party’s 28 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let us get back to the terms of the motion and the allegation that people <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this place by a direction of somebody outside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been not one tittle of evidence on any particular <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, looking at what the Leader of the Australian Country Party said, I defy any honourable member with common sense, any honourable member influenced by a national identity and with the interests of the nation at heart, either in logic, or in conscience to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of this Bill particularly if he believes in private enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will want to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be prepared to put a proposition to this Parliament and ask members of the Opposition which way they would <span class="highlight">vote</span> on that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will be interested to see whether the honourable member for Macarthur  (Mr Kerin),  who is seeking to interject, is prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Opposition if the gag is moved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no wonder that in this Parliament recently the Country Party voted against the proposal to disclose the source of campaign funds; no wonder the Liberal Party joined the Country Party in that stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that yesterday the Opposition in this place indicated that it will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Corporations and Securities Industry Bill and that the Opposition in the Senate voted against the proposal to divulge the source of party funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is apparent from the fact that in 1973 the Leader of the Opposition said that he would <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the proposal to divulge the source of campaign funds, and the Leader of the Country Party said that he too would <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that the coffers are overflowing with secret funds they’ voted against the proposition in this Parliament the other day and repudiated their intention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead it decided to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appeal to members of the Opposition to think again, to think about the poor, the underprivileged and the disadvantaged, before they coerce their colleagues in another place to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this very socially desirable measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also indicate to the House that no <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Bill will be taken tomorrow and that the opportunity will be given later in the sittings on an ordinary sitting day for honourable members to make their decision even if the debate should finish tomorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder how those honourable members who absented themselves from the <span class="highlight">vote</span> feel about being called back tomorrow, not to <span class="highlight">vote</span> but to be here to talk on this piece of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a chamber within which Bills are submitted, where first, second and third reading and committee stages are deliberated upon and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tomorrow there is to be talk but there is to be no <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for this reason that I suggest to the House that the calibre, background and experience of the honourable member for Lyne must be taken seriously into account when honourable members <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the election of the  Deputy Speaker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It now means that the  Speaker  or the  Deputy Speaker,  no matter who he is, cannot have confidence in the Prime Minister who, of course, is backed by the sheer weight of numbers, which was evidenced in a <span class="highlight">vote</span> taken earlier today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say, first of all, that the amendment as drafted displays some considerable skill in the game of tacking because it tries to force its opponents to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the first six principles it contains in order to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the seventh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one in this House wants to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against motherhood or to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of sin, but that is almost the position into which we are being put if we <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the first six principles outlined in the Minister’s amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, such is the public interest in this matter that I have decided that it is proper for me to stand and have my views as well as my <span class="highlight">vote</span> counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will therefore <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the amendment to the second reading in spite of my complete sympathy with its sentiments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my electorate many people are vocally propounding that the Bill should be thrown out, and that I should speak very strongly against it and <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have preferred, if it had been possible under the rules of the Parliament, that the Bill be subject to a referendum because then there would have been the opportunity for the silent majority to air its views and to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But many people from within my electorate, and indeed from without, have written expressing their attitude both for and against the Bill and exhorting me to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a particular manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position is that to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the amendment a person would put himself at risk of having his <span class="highlight">vote</span> widely misunderstood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pressed, I would be disposed to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the amendment with massive reluctance and a very great sense of personal distress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope to put a case against the principles that will guide us to a decision as to the way in which we will <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But naturally enough when we have a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> in both places on legislation of this kind we find a variety of expressions by individual members according to their own personal or religious convictions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I set about my task in considering what I should do when casting my <span class="highlight">vote</span> considering that I should blend, so far as I am able, both my own personal views and those of the people whom I represent in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly propose to repeat it whenever I am faced with social legislation in particular on which I have not only to consider what my personal <span class="highlight">vote</span> should be in a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> situation but also to present my arguments to my own Party before the Party’s opinion is formulated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well cast the Attorney-General in a totally different role from that in which he has been cast before but as a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> has been given to all honourable members, he would be necessarily cast in that role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My plea then is unashamedly on the grounds of personal Christian conviction and my conscience <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue is consistent with a lifelong experience of situations both within and outside the Church- situations of misery, distress and trauma. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that when the House votes on the Minister’s amendment it will do so uncluttered by any considerations of delay or frustration that may occur in the passage of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can deal with that in Committee, but I ask all members of the House, whatever their views on the legislation may be, when they <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Minister’s second reading amendment to make an assessment of the principles set out in that amendment and to disregard any suggestionswhich I repeat are unfounded- that the purpose of this amendment is to obstruct, delay and kill the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe in the legalisation of homosexuality practised by consenting adults, and I did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the motion then before the House on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I see it, the view I have expressed constrains me to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment now before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be some amendments to the clauses moved in the Committee stage which will be worthy of support but I shall be working on the premise that unless an amendment is of major importance or else an essential drafting matter, I shall <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the clauses of the Bill as they stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have carefully considered all the points made by those who have asked me to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Bui and I am convinced that their objections to what they think is contained in the Bill are adequately covered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge the sincerity of those in this House and in the community who are opposed to the principles contained in the Bill, but I must in conscience <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the net result of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this House will probably reflect the total community view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an amendment to the motion that the Bill be read a second time which many honourable members have said they support but will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for because they fear it will involve a delay of this measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment and for the contingent notice of motion if I did not believe that the Bill would proceed forthwith to the Committee stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been denied by those who support that amendment and would want to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Four of the members on the Government side did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> on that question; they absented themselves from the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament bled while that <span class="highlight">vote</span> was being taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You,  Mr Speaker,  last week when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken absented yourself along with 3 Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They came in, and they voted against every practice of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know very well that they delivered, by their lack of a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, a tremendous blow to the conventions of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who was it who knowingly allowed a person to sit and <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Senate chamber knowing that that person had resigned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said so much, I believe that the Parliament should <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this great issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Opposition know as well as I do that no matter whether we carry the amendments they will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the third reading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not tell me the Opposition will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the third reading even if the clauses are amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasury is asking the Parliament to <span class="highlight">vote</span> $130m on this occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can anybody say that there was a mandate for this particular proposal more than any other when it formed such a small part of the Government’s overall proposals and when at the last Federal election the Government’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> dropped? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How Government supporters can say that they have a mandate for anything after the <span class="highlight">vote</span> dropping, especially when they made a bigger issue of this at the last election than at the election before, nobody in his right mind can understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be seen, therefore, that the getting of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on even the motion for the second reading of the Bill would present great problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was also decided that if any honourable member desired to move at any stage ‘That the question be now put’ it would be quite right for him to do so but that there would be no Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> on that motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, if anybody were to move ‘That the question be now put’ there would be an entirely free <span class="highlight">vote</span> insofar as the supporters of the Government are concerned as to whether it should or should not be put. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, I think that every honourable member is very interested ‘in this matter and would like either to speak on the subject matter or to cast his <span class="highlight">vote</span> one way or another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned earlier, if the gag is moved by a member from either side of the House tomorrow, so far as Government supporters are concerned there will be an entirely free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on that question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am just waiting for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> so I can make my opinion known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the gag or a device to curtail debate is moved tomorrow, he may be assured that every member on this side will be entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> as he or she wishes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The days of sitting will be longer; the sitting hours will be longer; and if honourable members opposite want to sit into the early hours of the morning, by all means they can <span class="highlight">vote</span> for that amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is on a personal and individual basis I put it to honourable members that they have a great responsibility for the future happiness and security of large numbers of people and families who can only benefit if the Family Law Bill is carried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before you <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the new Family Law Bill, please read these questions below that I have asked myself so many times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I don’t believe that these new laws will solve all the problems, but please <span class="highlight">vote</span> for them and get them working quickly, then we can see their failings and change them accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We, as members, of course have been reminded of our enormous responsibilities in this conscience <span class="highlight">vote</span> situation and we have all been subjected to a considerable volume of advice and exhortations as to how we should deal with the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a perpetuation of the cruelty and conflict created in the minds of children who are placed under great pressure quite often to choose between two parents as a part of the legal process in establishing fault in one parent which is often quite contrary to and in conflict with their natural affection for hoth parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> to perpetuate the undignified role of the professional snooper for the necessity to establish fault and I am not prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> to see the many thousands of unhappily married men and women throughout Australia condemned to the protracted anguish and inhumanity inherent in the present law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With that in mind I will certainly support the amendment this afternoon if a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because members of this House are able to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this legislation without regard to Party rulings it is more than ordinarily important that we examine the arguments put forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although if we are quite convinced as individual members that certain action is necessary in the interests of the community we should not hesitate to give expression to that opinion by our <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members of this House can by their <span class="highlight">vote</span> strengthen family life and give real happiness to many people who are now the victims of an unhappy relationship and at the same time lessen the most tragic effects on the lives of many thousands of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have even heard it said of the amendment by those who support the Bill in its entirety: ‘Well, those principles are all very good but we cannot <span class="highlight">vote</span> for them because we cannot deny the Bill a second reading’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I shall <span class="highlight">vote</span> not for a one-year period of separation as a ground for divorce but for a 2-year separation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for that deferment was simply that we were asked to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on and to discuss a major Bill, a very important Bill, a Bill that had come from the Senate with something like 100 amendments, a Bill which we had not seen, a Bill which we could not consider in 5 minutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason I would be inclined to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the amendment, not because I believe the amendment does not have much to commend it but because I believe that, when you are dealing with legislation, philosophy does not necessarily have to be expressed within the legislation itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Expenditure has however been incurred for incidental items such as consultants fees and this has been charged to the ‘Administrative <span class="highlight">Vote</span>’ of the Department of Housing and Construction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-49-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now members of the Opposition ask me why people <span class="highlight">vote</span> with their feet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They <span class="highlight">vote</span> with their feet for one very simple reason- to get out of war zones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He sat in the Upper House of the New South Wales Parliament and it was his <span class="highlight">vote</span> alone that resulted in the expulsion of his former friend from the Upper House, thus silencing  Mr Armstrong,  the Liberal MLC, forever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members on both sides of the House believe that if they <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a certain way in fact they might not achieve the result that they seek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I heard one honourable member say that he had received so many letters for the BUI and so many letters against the Bill, and that because he had received more letters for it he was going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker,  you would know, as other members of the House would know, that I am a conservative person and I represent a conservative electorate; I would be one of those who would be expected to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make it clear at the outset that I am going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Bill and I am going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the amendment mainly because, although it was not meant to be a device to confuse people, it has confused a great many people and I am one of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because I know I cannot do that and because I know there is no way of making people good in the sense that I use the word, I am going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That brief introduction indicates why I am going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Bill and why I am going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that I want to make my position clear: I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Bill and I Will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I intend to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the passage of the Bill in the second reading stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To sum up, I feel I should <span class="highlight">vote</span> to allow the Bill to pass the second reading stage and then keep my options open to consider critically various sections of it in the Committee stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Also I am rather humbled by the fact that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> which I may cast in this debate could have an effect on thousands and thousands of marital relationships in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion I make this comment: Side by side with my colleagues in the House of Representatives and the Senate I have been receiving an enormous number of letters from various people and associations indicating that if I <span class="highlight">vote</span> one way they will not be voting for me at the next election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Others have indicated that if I <span class="highlight">vote</span> the other way they will not be voting for me at that election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it came to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, particularly on the second matter, people were forced to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a way which was not really in accordance with their views, but they were left without any options and they had to take the course of voting for what was offered in the motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason a lot of honourable members voted in a manner in which they would not normally <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That one element alone should persuade any member of this House to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the commendable amendment moved by the Minister for Tourism and Recreation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to honourable members, knowing that there is a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this Bill, that we should not demean ourselves by just passing the buckpassing the legislation on to some other group of people who, in themselves, will be divided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This House, all 127 members- or at least of all those who care to <span class="highlight">vote</span>- must <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the issue because it really means that every man must stand up and be counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In characteristic pig-headed style the Government chooses to ignore the telegrams of protest from the Aboriginal people, its shocking defeat in the Queensland State election and its very poor <span class="highlight">vote</span> amongst Aboriginal communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my speech last week I threw down a challenge to both the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Senator Cavanagh)  and the Queensland Government to give the Aboriginal people who are members of the communities on reserves in Queensland the opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on whether they wanted these clauses included in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Despite what he has said today, I still maintain that the Aboriginal people of Queensland, mainly those who live in Aboriginal communities and who are affected by the Queensland Act, should be given the opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on whether they want these clauses retained in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this House we will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against them all because we have not had time to consider them in detail, and particularly as previously honourable members opposite have voted against their own amendments without having bothered to discuss them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is increasing the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> and in that way negating the real democratic approach that there should be in this country whereby people know precisely for whom they are voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How often have all honourable members, as I certainly have, felt the confusion of persons who are voting by post, who wish to <span class="highlight">vote</span> absentee, and do not know for which Party a particular candidate is standing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Or ‘religion- Anglican ‘-that would be wrong too, I suppose- and add ‘failed the Leaving Certificate, union representative’ and a series of other matters which the electorate is just as entitled to know in formulating a view as to how it will <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that that information is available to the electorate in the newspapers and through how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my way of thinking, the only people who are not informed when they <span class="highlight">vote</span> are those who do not want to be informed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The electors in my electorate, because they <span class="highlight">vote</span> for me, are extraordinarily intelligent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time there are occasions when they are denied information and there is an embarrassment on the part of the returning officer, who is a public servant and an impartial person, when an elector comes to make a <span class="highlight">vote</span> because he or she is going away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are entitled to make a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the returning office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That person has to take a punt on how he casts his <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The one piece of paper that the person must touch on election day should have on it as much information as is necessary to enable the electors to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should it not show the party affiliation of the candidates for whom he has to <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most obvious exercise that has ever been undertaken to ensure that many candidates contest a ballot in order to bemuddle the people was undertaken, of course, during the Senate selection that was conducted together with the House of Representatives election following the double dissolution in 1974 in relation to which a political research team discovered that the Australian Labor Party would lose 80 per cent of the additional informal votes for every candidate above the number of 40 who ran at that election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw the disgusting spectacle of a 12.3 per cent informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> being cast in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite should not try to push under the carpet something of which the honourable members who sit on this side of the House said honourable members should be ashamed, that is, the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to point out that the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> is something that affects us more than it affects the conservative parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I would like to say something about in particular in the few minutes that I have at my disposal before the suspension of the sitting is the method of handing out how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In brief- it is probably known to most members of this chamber- it involves the placing of a howtovote card for each party and each candidate in each cubicle of a polling booth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see several advantages in that as opposed to the current system of having each party’s representatives handing out how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards en masse outside polling booths all day on polling day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly the arguments that have been put against the proposal to have these how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards put in the cubicles is that in Britain the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is not compulsory whereas in Australia it is compulsory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They argue that it is more effective from a party’s point of view and its candidate’s point of view to have personnel belonging to that party standing outside the polling booth handing out the party’s own how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards depicting precisely how that party wishes the people supporting it to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for its candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It costs each of the political parties a tremendous amount of money- an awful waste of expenditure- printing large numbers of howtovote cards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every one of us who has been closely associated with elections over the years knows very well that there is always a tremendous lot of how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards left over at the end of the day and these are simply thrown away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many times I have seen people held up because of being crowded around by supporters of all parties trying to thrust how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards into their hands as they enter the booths. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally I see great advantage from the point of view of party members and supporters themselves who stand for hour after hour on polling days handing out how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards, many times in the hot sun and sometimes in the rain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we consider that, amongst the 73 candidates, some received only 150 votes out of about 2 million votes, nobody could say that these were not frivolous candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that, with the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> running at such a huge number, something must be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition will not agree to optional preferential voting which allows people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a limited number of candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the overall picture, it does affect democracy by the packing of ballot papers at a low cost, and in that way it defeats the real <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It deals with the ‘substitution of metric measurements; it gives ah enrolled person who is in prison the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> even if his sentence is less than one year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 27 also provides that a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> application should be issued under the authority of the Chief Australian Electoral Officer on a form specified by him, by notice in the Gazette, as being the form to be used for the particular election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is said that from these lists a great number of postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> application forms- sometimes it runs into thousands in an electoral division- are partially completed well in advance of the next ensuing election and forwarded to those electors at or about the time of the issue of the writs without a precise knowledge of whether the persons concerned are in fact entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> by post. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The postal voting procedure is that an application is made for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to consider this because one <span class="highlight">vote</span> can cause the defeat of a member, the defeat of a government or the election of a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are all filled in and on the day the writs are issued these forms are sent to everybody who voted last time asking them whether they want to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and, in effect, almost soliciting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the return of the postal votes, under the postal voting system it is possible at this stage to <span class="highlight">vote</span> after the close of the poll on the Saturday night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The postmark is no longer taken as the date on which one recognises the postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As long as the <span class="highlight">vote</span> comes in within, I think, 10 days afterwards it is accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one reason why the postal votes ought to be in the electoral office on the night of the poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every person who gets a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> ought to be called upon to do what every other person in the community does and that is to <span class="highlight">vote</span> before the close of the poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should also be the responsibility of the person who gets a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> to see that he gets it back in time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only fair way to see that every <span class="highlight">vote</span> is cast before the close of the poll is as we have suggested here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a Senate election one cannot possibly commence to fix the quota until every postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> is in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore if we allow this 10-day period it means that we will be held up until the very last <span class="highlight">vote</span> is in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has come to my knowledge from experienced scrutineers that they think that in one or two cases seats have been won or lost because of people who have voted under the present method after the close of the poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So this clause makes an attempt not to prevent people from voting but to see that all votes are in on the night the election is held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In practically every country if the votes are not in on the night of the poll they are not counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People know by half past 10 or 11 o’clock at night who has won the election because the votes are in the box. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no reason at all why people who <span class="highlight">vote</span> should not have their <span class="highlight">vote</span> in on the night of the election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt, as a result of the common form which has existed over the years, that people who consider themselves smart electioneers have been able to manipulate the manner in which they are able to get people to cast postal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conditions exist under which people are eligible for postal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, many people who cast postal votes perhaps do not want to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at all but are coerced into voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, many people who cast postal votes are not eligible to do so because they do not comply with the laws set down on the postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By looking at the figures concerning postal votes that were cast one can see how expert the political parties of Australia are becoming at going around hospitals, nursing homes and old folks’ homes trying to make people <span class="highlight">vote</span> when in fact they do not want to <span class="highlight">vote</span> or they have an excuse for not voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In New South Wales in 1972 2.49 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was postal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Victoria in 1972 was 3.06 per cent and in 1974 6.27 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the people involved- not just the political parties but all candidates- are becoming increasingly aware, particularly in the marginal electorates, of the importance of postal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In looking at the present system it seems to me that we have perhaps to be considerate of the people who may be involved in postal voting, to be considerate of the people who have put up with others going around canvassing in the hospitals and nursing homes and, as I say, be aware of the fact that candidates may be keeping forms from a previous election which they just post out hoping that the person concerned still needs a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest and predict that the figures I have read out tonight from the States will continue to grow and people will become professional postal voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  whether under this clause he is considering closing the polls at 6 p.m. or 8 p.m. on the night of the election, bearing in mind that a great percentage of voters in the electorates of Kalgoorlie, the Northern Territory, Kennedy and in other remote places are often lucky to get their postal ballot paper on the day of the election and then technically, of course, they are not allowed to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have suggested on several occasions that this system has been used to deprive the country voter of his franchise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is taking the <span class="highlight">vote</span> away from the person who does not five in a city or town or within 5 miles of a polling booth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a patently very obvious method of doing away with their votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s proposal not only will affect people in the back blocks of Australia but it will effectively debar from voting or having a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> any person who is unable to attend at an electoral office on the Friday before the Saturday of the poll- that is, at any time after 6 p.m. on the Thursday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She would not be able to attend the electoral office in time to cast a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> and therefore she would be debarred from voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The one great characteristic of the Australian voting system, which has been denigrated, rubbished and criticised, is that it is the only voting system in the world which is designed to guarantee that nobody is elected unless he gets 50 per cent plus one of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a greater awareness of electoral responsibilities, the obligation to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and the capacity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Australia and in its States than in other parts of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposed amendment has in it the ingredients to destroy the proposition that nobody can be elected in Australia unless they receive 50 per cent of the votes plus one <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is seeking to provide by this legislation that a person can be elected with less than 50 per cent of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am appalled at the attempt to deprive these people of their right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No democratic government or government that respects the democratic system itself or the right of each person to <span class="highlight">vote</span> could possibly support that principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can say only that the Minister for Services and Property, who has been good at getting votes himself, has had this proposition put on him by someone else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, I do not think in these provisions we ought to be concentrating on improving the percentage of informal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Britain one can furnish a <span class="highlight">vote</span> by proxy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What the Government would do by maintaining this provision would be to cut out a number of people who are at present able to register postal votes either because of delays in mail, because of remoteness, or because a person was ill and put off voting for a few days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the honourable member think that people will be able to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the remote regions of the north-west of Western Australia, in the electorate of Grey and in north Queensland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the honourable member think that they will get postal votes in in time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that even with the period that is provided now some votes are received too late. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable members, particularly those who come from city electorates, to remember the distances and the procedures that are involved in postal voting before committing themselves to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of this clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where a person is enrolled as an elector for a Division referred to in sub-section (1), otherwise than by virtue of section 39a or 4 1a, and it is normally difficult for him to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a polling booth open in the State for which he is enrolled by reason of- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An elector who is registered under this section is, by force of this section, but subject to Part VI and to the regulations, entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at an election in accordance with this Pan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As soon as practicable after the hour of nomination for an election the Divisional Returning Officer shall send a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> certificate and a postal ballotpaper or postal ballot-papers, as the case requires, to each elector who is registered on the register for the Division, other than an elector who has made an application under section 85.”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It refers to those people in remote areas and to the difficulty that they have in getting postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> application forms and ballot papers in time and in having them returned so that their votes can be counted- in fact, so that these people can <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe, and the Opposition believes, that the remoteness of those people is such that special provision should be made in the electoral law to enable them to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is suggested here is that the divisional returning officer for a division that exceeds 26 000 square kilometres shall keep a register to be called the ‘Register of General Postal Voters’, and such persons shall receive automatically application forms for postal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They probably would have one chance, and one chance only, of registering a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Presumably it is because they think that these votes will not favour the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not matter that they are fully entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite say: ‘They are remote and we will try to prevent their <span class="highlight">vote</span> being received at the polling place in time. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people must make a <span class="highlight">vote</span> under the compulsory provisions of the Act, but it is more important than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is their right to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span>- a valid <span class="highlight">vote</span> and an acceptable <span class="highlight">vote</span>- if they possibly can. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take this opportunity to make a plea to anyone who might be listening in these remote areas to do their best to get these votes in, even if it means considerable inconvenience in travelling to a booth because of the uncertainty of the mails. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would mean that postal voters obviously could be canvassed between elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would mean that they would not be encouraged to go to the polling booths and it also would mean, if one wants to look at it in bold terms of the voting patterns of those people who live in the remote areas, that the Aboriginal people perhaps would be denied a <span class="highlight">vote</span> altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Kalgoorlie  (Mr Collard),  whose division was mentioned tonight by the honourable member for Curtin, is not in favour of setting up a register of postal voters in his electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under our laws people ought to be encouraged to go and <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the polling booths. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a provision under which people can obtain a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> if they are ill or too far away from their electorate to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a booth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course our complaint is that postal votes come in long after the booths are closed and Australia and the rest of the world has to wait to see who is to govern this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course under the Opposition’s proposal a returning officer on the night on which the poll closes could say: ‘There is only 50 votes difference between the sitting member and the candidate for the other major political party’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would immediately look at the postal voting register to see how many people he had not received votes from and would have an immediate check on whom he could get in touch with to go out and see those persons to make sure that some son of postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> was recorded on behalf of those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then he would make sure that there was some evidence that the votes were posted before 6 p.m. or 8 p.m., whatever is the time specified in this Bill when it is finally passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have electoral rolls and there are provisions, which apply fairly, under which people can obtain a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that Australia has to wait far too long for the return of those postal votes to get a decision for the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall the postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> vendetta carried on in my electorate in which one of my postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> workers was run off the road in true Chicago style by a party worker for the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember Party workers of the Australian Labor Party standing over the aged and the sick and threatening them that if they filled in their postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> application form before the workers returned to do it for them, anything could happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I heard the Minister for Services and Property refer indirectly to me some time ago when he spoke of a member of the Liberal Party who had several hundred- I think he used the phrase ‘two thousand ‘-postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> application forms ready to go out into the electorate last year when the green light was switched on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This clause amends section 89 of the Act to provide that a person is not entitled to inspect applications made under sub-section (3) for the purpose of compiling lists of the names of persons who have made postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> applications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under section 89 (3) as it now stands, applications for postal votes are open for public inspection from and including the third day after polling day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That provision currently is used by political organisations and candidates to make lists of all postal votes for use at later elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed to prohibit the listing of names of persons who apply for postal votes, except where the Divisional Returning Officer is satisfied that it is required in connection with a genuine inquiry into possible malpractice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the view of the Opposition that the clause is intended to prevent persons from inspecting lists of those people who have applied for postal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely, in order to prevent abuse and to prevent parties from sending out unwanted postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> applications, the change in the colour of the form that was suggested earlier by the Opposition should suffice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You cannot solicit postal votes, tell people that they can get them and all this kind of thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is that we believe that if a person can prove to the satisfaction of the authorities that an application for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> is necessary in connection with some infringement or otherwise then that person is entitled to have it but there should be no way whereby he can be canvassed against the spirit of the Act, in that way giving an unfair advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not wish tq canvass the matter extensively but I mention for the benefit of honourable members that under section 87A of the Act a person shall not persuade or induce or associate himself with a person in persuading or inducing an elector to make application for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> certificate and postal ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That advertisement by the honourable member for Griffith about postal votes goes terribly close to breaching the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland a person can obtain a State roll and every person who had a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the previous State election, or Brisbane City Council election or local council election, has a little stamp marked next to his name indicating that he had a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> or what they call a caller’s <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-That is right, an electoral visitor’s <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we will never be able to do by legislation is to prevent candidates of any political party compiling special lists of names of people who are known to be infirm or ill whom they then canvass to solicit their votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we can do by agreeing to this clause is prevent an organised, large scale undertaking in which people are solicited and stood over to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a specific candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards already achieve that purpose without the great disadvantage which registration would impose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed voting proposals would have the effect of denying many people their right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They include provisions for mobile polling booths in hospitals, the prevention of the use of unacceptable names on ballot papers, an increase in deposits, the provision of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for persons serving a prison term of less than 12 months and control on the dissemination of misleading electoral material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that if voting is to be compulsory electors should be given every opportunity to have their votes counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Postal votes are the only way by which many ill people, travellers or people living in remote areas can <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s proposals require postal votes to be lodged no later than the close of the poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would replace the present 10-day delay from the close of poll to the counting of postal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would effectively disfranchise anyone whose <span class="highlight">vote</span> was held up by the Government’s erratic postal system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would disfranchise those who did not submit their postal votes several days before the poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sick, the infirm and the traveller would be denied their right to exercise a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that, if people are forced to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, they should be given as much time as possible to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If voting is to be compulsory the voters should register all their choices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our present laws allow persons 18 years of age to <span class="highlight">vote</span> but prevent the appointment of those same people as assistants at a poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clauses 42 and 44 make the asking of questions of voters at the discretion of the Presiding Officers, although a safeguard is provided that a scrutineer may require the questions to be put. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the real fact about this matter is that the present Act is in conflict with itself, and each time a voter is asked a question he is in fact challenged by the Presiding Officer as to whether or not he has the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Principal among these matters must surely be a simpler way of expressing preference of candidates, indeed, a system of voting which would provide a choice for electors without in any way denying the right of voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in passing I mention the general election of 1 966 for the House of Representatives when at least one long-standing and highly regarded member of this House lost his seat because of a fairly high informal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of informal votes cast on that occasion was extraordinarily high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It became very clear to me that on the ballot papers excluded by the returning officer as invalid- of course, within the scope of the Act he had no option- the voters had expressed their order of preference correctly for 6 of the 8 candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pollard had 2 candidates’ names beneath his name on the ballot paper and the electors who wished to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for Pollard started with his name, marked No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What he is saying is that because many or even some of the provisions in this Bill are similar to those in a Bill which was introduced by the honourable member for Gwydir  (Mr Hunt)  therefore the Opposition ought to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the whole of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly- and all of us who know the Minister would suspect this- there are those amendments that are designed to assist the Labor Party <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments about which I desire to speak are those in the first 2 categories, that is, those designed to assist the Labor <span class="highlight">vote</span> and those debatable reforms with which some would agree and some would disagree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amongst those changes that are designed to assist the Labor <span class="highlight">vote</span>, of course, first and foremost comes the optional preferential marking of ballot papers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party is in power in England when it received something of the order of 35 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the combined <span class="highlight">vote</span> for Liberal Party candidates and Conservative Party candidates would be well ahead of that for Labor party candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But on the postal votes, Padman, the LiberalCountry Party candidate, got up and narrowly won the election by 150 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result was that the Liberal and Country Parties would have won in 1950 but they had to wait until 1956 to win and to change the system to get back to a system under which any Australian is entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> wherever he is in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed that instead of having up to 10 days after the end of voting for the postal votes to come in that postal votes should have to be in by the same time as the ballot closes on the Saturday night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But where there is a short election campaign period- the tendency is for the elections to become shorter and shorter and I think this is a good tendency because people get to know the issues relatively quickly- this would mean that 10 days before an election was held a person who was overseas would have to post his <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, this proposal is only an attempt to increase the Labor proportion of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We know that in 1 96 1 40 votes in one electorate were enough to keep the Menzies Government in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A proposal that deprives people of hundreds of postal votes that would run strongly in favour of the Liberal-Country Parties would help to keep an unpopular Labor Government in office against the will of the people generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know there is something to be said for 6 p.m. closing but on the other hand there are problems, particularly for those people of religious beliefs who cannot <span class="highlight">vote</span> until after the sun goes down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course in a small metropolitan electorate all the booths are heavily manned and as one goes in one is given a how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a number in my own electorate and I know that you,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  have many in your electorate, where there might be only 70 or 80 votes cast in a day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore many people <span class="highlight">vote</span> without knowing accurately who are the candidates and for what parties they stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember when I was voting absentee in Queanbeyan in a State election on one occasion a Liberal from Sydney came out of the booth and said to me: ‘I do not know whether I voted for the Liberal candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope I voted for the right one. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have maintained for years, ever since I have been a member of this House, that we ought to abolish the system of handing out how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards and have the party affiliation on the ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, there is also ho doubt that the 3 major matters that I mentioned are designed for only one purpose and that is to improve the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were also provisions for candidates to declare changes of name, for banning misleading how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards, for granting candidates a defence on charges of gift giving, for the renaming or renumbering of streets, for the regulation of electoral posters in certain places, and more realistic penalties for breaches of the electoral law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A very high informal <span class="highlight">vote</span>, as is now indicated, makes a mockery of the compulsory voting provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is so complicated that 12 per cent of Senate votes in New South Wales were discarded as informal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people are to be compelled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at all, then at least the process should be modified so that it is easier to understand, simpler to operate and quicker to produce results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor is there anything sacrosanct about preferential voting; it was introduced in Australia for no other purpose than to accommodate the Country Party and to avoid splitting the antiLabor <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and it proved so unsatisfactory in Senate elections that it was superseded in 1 948. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It simply means that voters will not be obliged to place consecutive numbers in every square on the ballot paper to ensure that their <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They need <span class="highlight">vote</span> only for as many candidates as there are vacanciesone in each House of Representatives electorate and normally five on each Senate ticket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But voters who wish to rank all or several candidates in order of preference may do so and their preferences will be taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not compel people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for scores of candidates whom they have no opportunity of identifying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that time a person has to make an application for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> and if he lives 5 miles from a polling booth the paper has to be posted out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members should bear in mind that when nominations close the printing of ballot papers and how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards must then start and they have to be posted to various places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are any number of places which are more than 5 miles from a polling booth and in which the people are entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is an utter denial of the right of Australian citizens to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You cannot just bring in laws that will stop people from having the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They do not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for us anyhow. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by omitting from paragraph (b) the words ‘, and that the <span class="highlight">vote</span> contained in the envelope was recorded prior to the close of the poll,’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s argument in respect of this clause and a number of others- those relating to postal votes and those relating to other matters, such as the reduction in the hours of polling and in other procedures- is that they are all aimed at getting a quicker result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is more important to provide reasonable opportunities for Australians to <span class="highlight">vote</span> than to get a quick result and surely it is more important to get an accurate result than to have speed as the major objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the system in Australia, and in other countries in our situation in which government is handed over freely and constitutionally and in which the result of an election may not be known for some days, is one that can be easily accepted if one gets an accurate result, a true reflection of what the people want, and one makes reasonable provision for the people to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all we have a compulsory system of voting which surely means that the Government and, indeed, the Parliament should be providing for conditions that make it reasonably easy for people either to <span class="highlight">vote</span> under compulsion or to exert their rights as they happen to see the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This clause provides that only postal votes received up to the close of the poll should be counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is also wanting to restrict the time in which postal votes can be received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>those who are ill and those who are travelling have a fair opportunity to lodge a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and then have it counted and not treated as invalid and ruled out of order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier I referred to the deadline for application for postal votes and to one or two connected provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These provisions could result in a significant number of postal voters being disenfranchised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that records are kept of the number of postal votes received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not just a question of what people are entitled to do under the laws about getting a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a nursing home of 30, 40 or 50 people one only has to mention the word ‘<span class="highlight">vote</span>’ and the whole place goes into turmoil, because elderly people become very concerned that they may have done something wrong or that they have forgotten to do something. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One only has to look at the increase in postal voting in his electorate to see how well he is setting up a register of postal voters in his electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for the Northern Territory gets an 84 per cent postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Northern Territory, which I think speaks volumes for the type of assistance and the type of expertise that is provided to him by the electoral office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely we do not have to sit around for 10 days hoping that we can think up some methods by which we can manipulate the system in order to get a few more votes if at the conclusion of the counting on polling night we find that there is only a handful of votes between the candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has become accepted practice in everything from cricket clubs to politics to draw for positions on the ballot papers when elections are being held as it is felt that that brings a degree of fairness because there are those who might <span class="highlight">vote</span> straight down the ticket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt at all that there have been deliberate selections of candidates whose names begin with letters high in the alphabet for the purpose of getting what is known as the donkey <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This brings the method into line with that of the Senate and of practically every other place where a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clancy polled 3,300 votes out of a total of approximately 41 000 formal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose there is not a great deal to be said on this, except that it will restrict the hours of voting for people who are obliged by legislation to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We think the change ought not to be made because electors should be given as much chance as possible to lodge their <span class="highlight">vote</span> at polling places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They also know that some people, because of their religious beliefs, do not wish to <span class="highlight">vote</span> when the sun is up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not think the people to whom I have referred are insignificant in number and therefore should be expected to lodge a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>, particularly under the proposed restricted facilities for postal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I repeat that because they have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and ought to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and also because they are compelled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> under law, the 12-hour voting period ought to be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have noticed that a few people who did not bother to check their facts quite outrageously tried to exploit this situation as if what the Government was proposing was some form of restriction of the right of orthodox Jewry to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>shall put to every person claiming to <span class="highlight">vote</span> ( not being an elector enrolled by virtue of section 4 1  a)  the following questions: - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>may, and at the request of any scrutineer shall, also put to any person claiming to <span class="highlight">vote</span> all or any of the following questions: - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then again, the people are forced to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the high percentage of voters is the result of the compulsion on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A small fine for not voting achieves a 92 per cent or 93 per cent <span class="highlight">vote</span> in most areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I notice that the instructions that are given on how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the proposed scheme are far more complicated than those in the scheme that we have at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But informal votes, a feature of the proposed system which has been emphasised by the Prime Minister, were equally as high in the Senate when voting was voluntary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if that is any criterion we cannot expect the percentage of informal votes to drop very much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The low percentages of informal votes at the moment are remarkably good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fair enough to make things as simple as possible, but I think it is somewhat insulting to assume that the matter can be simplified further to include the votes of a significant number of people who supposedly are not casting valid votes at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A group in Sydney called the Independent Political Research Organisation thoroughly researched the pattern of informal voting and concluded that for every candidate over 40 who might stand for the Senate in New South Wales we could expect an increase in the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> of 0.5 per cent and that 80 per cent of those people would be intending Labor voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not true to say that in 1974 we had the usual informal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had 73 candidates for the Senate and a 12.3 per cent informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the whole State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, had their votes been formal or had the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Senate election paralleled the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the House of Representatives election there can be no doubt that the Labor Party in New South Wales would have won 6 positions in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition- and one could expect this of the Liberal Party- the highest informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> in New South Wales happens to be among the migrant groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at division after division in New South Wales we will find that the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> is highest where there is the highest concentration of migrants, and this is because political Parties ignore the spending of money on avenues that may be of influence in the migrant communities, or cannot afford it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the observations made earlier in the campaign we did get a high formal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People were predicting a 25 per cent, 30 per cent or 40 per cent informal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the major political Parties in the meantime spent fortunes trying to educate the community how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> from 1 to 73. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The electorate of Sydney, which has a high concentration of migrants, had a 20 per cent informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the 1974 Senate election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be worth its while spending $50,000 to put up 50 additional candidates for the Senate, because it knows that in some way that may affect the formal <span class="highlight">vote</span> intended for the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most people want to <span class="highlight">vote</span> exclusively for the person they want to represent them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But people are sitting in this Parliament because of preferences well down the list, If people, especially the migrant community, want to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for just the person they know or the person they want to represent them, under this legislation they can do so, and where people want to <span class="highlight">vote</span> down the complete list they can do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the people will be able to identify their team and not go any further than they want in voting or they may <span class="highlight">vote</span> for 2 teams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we have a first class example of this in Britain where we see that a Labour candidate may get 36 per cent or 37 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and the Liberal candidate and the Conservative candidate split the rest of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, 63 per cent of the electorate may <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Labour candidate yet because he is the first past the post he wins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government were consistent it would realise that the Liberal Party, for instance, in the United Kingdom can poll millions of votes and yet win almost no seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no relationship at all between the percentage of votes cast for the party and the number of seats won by it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We believe that it militates against the operation of the democratic <span class="highlight">vote</span> and we reject it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is that at the moment a lot of people are being deprived of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> because of the system under which they <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present system of preferential voting was brought in by Prime Minister Billy Hughes at the behest of the Country Party after he had left the Labor Party in 1919 to organise votes in the interests of the conservative parties by ganging up and exchanging preferences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Political parties and candidates will still give out how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> cards and if they want a preference to be expressed their supporters will express that preference by voting according to the party ticket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been argued constantly, both during this debate and on the other occasion that this Bill was before the House, that it is wrong to compel people to extend their preference beyond the first preference to cast a formal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is wrong to compel people to extend their preference beyond the first preference I would like the Minister for Services and Property, when he speaks to this clause, to justify his Government’s commitment to a system of compulsory voting, because if it is wrong to compel people to do things when they <span class="highlight">vote</span>, how can one possibly justify compelling people to <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is worried about compulsion in the electoral system, it ought to go back to basics and concern itself with whether or not people ought to be compelled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Smith gets 41 primary votes, Brown gets 39 votes and Jones gets 20 votes, making a total of 100 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the present system, the preferences of the candidate with 20 votes, that is Jones, are distributed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us say that the other 2 candidates get 10 votes each. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Smith ends up with 5 1 votes, which is an absolute majority, and Brown ends up with 49 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But with optional preferential voting, perhaps only 10 of the 20 people who voted for Jones had distributed their preferential beyond No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1, so there are only 10 second preference votes to distribute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Smith ends up with 46 votes and brown ends up with 44 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the optional preferential system the first candidate, Smith, wins with 46 of the 100 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your <span class="highlight">vote</span> must be made by placing the number 1 in the square opposite the name of the candidate for whom you <span class="highlight">vote</span> as your first preference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the closest thing to a preferential <span class="highlight">vote</span> that I can think of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will go so far as to say that irrespective of whether this is passed by this Parliament, it ultimately will come in because not one person in the 2 750 000 voters in New South Wales at the time of the Senate election in May voted intelligently or knew the candidates for whom he was voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I defy the most intelligent person in this country to <span class="highlight">vote</span> intelligently preferentially for 73 candidates, or in some cases for 7 or 10 candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is that local government should have a voice of its own on the Loan Council, At the Premiers Conference in 1973 the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  proposed that local government have both a voice and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Loan Council and that the Australian Government be empowered to borrow money on behalf of local governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that local government must have its own voice and <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Loan Council and that all councillors in all cities, shires and municipalities should be fighting for a voice on the Loan Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The majority <span class="highlight">vote</span> will prevail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  chairman  will have a deliberate <span class="highlight">vote</span> and, if necessary, a casting <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I endorse the remarks of previous speakers on this side of the House who expressed some concern that it appears that the Government, through its powers under clauses 9 and 13 of the Bill, has the right to dictate a policy of promotional thrusts because it has the right of appointing a member to represent the Department of Agriculture, who shall be the  Chairman  with a casting <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could not <span class="highlight">vote</span> with my Party if it supported the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have to abstain from voting if the matter were pushed to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the motion that the Bill be read a second time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I know it has succumbed to the pressures of the moguls of the Press and I am sure that the honourable member for Kooyong, running true to form, ultimately Will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the BUI, as he has indicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the honourable gentleman speaks about defence expenditure let me remind him that in 1970-7 1 the percentage of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> spent on equipment was 12.7 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We made a decision in our time that by 1977 the objective would be that 28 per cent of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> would be spent on defence equipment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it will be 5 to 8 years, as he claims, before any equipment that is ordered will appear in the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>, it must equally be the case that if expenditure is not in the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> at present it is the result of policies of 4 to 8 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1969, when the country was still embroiled in Vietnam,  Mr Fairhall  cut the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> by 5 per cent in real terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liberal-Country Party governments have not been slow to choose the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> as their first target. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In February 1971 the cut in Government expenditure as an anti-inflationary measure saw the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> receive the first and largest cut. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From a total of $75.5m cut from Government expenditure, the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> cut was $2 1.5m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Between them there was a gap of 2 years when the dried vine fruits stabilisation scheme did not apply as a result of a direct <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the growers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So he goes on and on and urges them to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for such historic names as Eddie Foat, Joe McDonald, Len Keogh in Bowman, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was imploring the workers of Evans Deakin to <span class="highlight">vote</span> Labor in 1972 because if they did so they would be guaranteed a good deal under the Labor Party as far as shipping was concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Opposition has learnt nothing else in opposition but the fact that pensioners are not to be held to ransom every time there is an election and a carrot dangled in front of them to try to win their <span class="highlight">vote</span> maybe its period in opposition has not been completely in vain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In almost every election campaign that I can recall, the proud boast of the Australian Labor Party has always been that it would be able to outbid all members of other political parties in their attempts to influence the Australian people and to induce them to believe that the Commonwealth of Australia will be able to provide for aU of them from the cradle to the grave simply if they <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think it was Professor Friedman who said recently that any government which stood up and said: ‘<span class="highlight">Vote</span> for us; we are going to put an insidious 16 per cent tax on all of your incomes ‘ would not get the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of any person who could add up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no reason for the Opposition to have these hang-ups and to wish to alter the Bill in the manner indicated in the proposed amendment on which we have just voted and the amendment that has now been moved by the honourable member for Sturt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am surprised, in particular, that the right honourable member for Higgins  (Mr Gorton)  was in the chamber for the last <span class="highlight">vote</span> because he, of all people, is trying to bring sense to the Opposition in the matter of these hang-ups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Various Parliaments throughout Australia in both the State and Federal spheres have done their best over the years to protect the right of people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is felt that the proposal by this Government to eliminate country polling booths which have not averaged over 50 votes per booth for the past 3 years, is a very serious matter for country people throughout Australia because if this proposal is implemented, and I have no doubt that it will be, many people will be disfranchised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous regulation provided for an average of 30 voters over a period of 3 years to constitute an area where a polling booth would be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great problem is that many voters in inaccessible areas in the country where the polling booths are to be eliminated could be disfranchised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am asking that the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly),  who administers the voting procedure in the Australian political sphere, treat this matter sympathetically because people in country areas Uke to cast their <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the same way as do those in the city and they should not be prevented from voting by the elimination of polling booths such as those I have mentioned here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How on earth are people expected to <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether this is a political ploy of the Government to stop the right of people in outback areas exercising their <span class="highlight">vote</span> is a matter of extreme doubt in my mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I was making, of course, is that there is nothing to stop any of the people in these areas from obtaining a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They live the necessary distance away from the nearest polling booth, and presumably they are fully capable of obtaining a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> legally and in every other possible respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation is a Government Bill but members are, naturally, free to <span class="highlight">vote</span> as their conscience dictates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be reasonable to dispense with this opportunity on Monday; but the honourable gentleman is saying: ‘If we cannot contain our own members and if we cannot get the <span class="highlight">vote</span> through, we are dashed if we are going to allow the members of the Opposition to raise any matters that are of importance to the nation until such time as I have things within my own Party in control again’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see it as essential that a matter of this kind, relating to legislation which will be given a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>, also be given a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish members of the Labor Party would accept the proposition that a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> should be given on this procedural motion also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because there are so many matters of objectionparticularly the 5-minute constraint, the elimination of discussions of matters of public importance and the giving of precedence to Government Business until the Family Law Bill has been disposed of- the Opposition intends to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a Government Bill, not a private member’s Bill, but there is to be a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On matters such as abortion reform and on other matters of a social nature it has been the practice of the Government to allow a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>, but so that the votes may be taken procedures have been laid down and endorsed on party lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When all is said and done, nearly 50 hours have been devoted to it, as honourable members know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will go so far as to say that practically every honourable member of this Parliament now knows how he is going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the amendments and everything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that every fair-minded member of this Parliament will realise the intentions behind the motion- to bring this Bill forward, to debate it, <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it and reach a decision at the earlier possible time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because of the potential confusion which the original name would certainly have caused we do not intend to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the motion in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason, I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every intelligent supporter of the Government- there are many intelligent honourable members on the other side- who thinks clearly, sensibly and decently will join us and <span class="highlight">vote</span> with this side of the House on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it because I believe confidence has to be restored, and the sooner the business community knows that this Bill will be chucked out and that the community will not be deprived of access to the money markets for its development programs the better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that responsible members of the Australian Labor Party Government will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this amendment, probably for no other reason than that they hold marginal seats and want to save their skins at the next election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I invite honourable members opposite, if they are opposed to the Superannuation Bill, to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Liberal members wish to put their votes where their mouths are they can reject the Superannuation Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> and we probably represent a true cross section of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I took the view that the National Marriage Council of Australia would be both objective and knowledgeable in these matters, and there are problems with an open <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>That is the position for which I propose to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My judgment leads me to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the amendment of the Attorney-General  (Mr Enderby)  which would provide that, if there is mutual consent, the marriage may be dissolved after 3 months separation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One <span class="highlight">vote</span> may well decide all the amendments, including the proposal of the Attorney-General himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I support the amendment of the honourable member for Wentworth and will <span class="highlight">vote</span> accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like the Attorney-General to indicate how he envisages these clauses would operate before I would <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of the establishment of a Family Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not seek to reflect upon a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of this chamber, but as I have observed in the past, I think it is the quintessence of absurdity that the principal law officer of the Crown is muzzled to the extent that he is given 5 minutes in debate, the same amount of time as any other member of this Committee is given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the Government has in mind- I should say that it is what I have in mind because I remind myself that this is not a Government Bill; this is a Bill that came from the Senate after a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This  is a Bill on which honourable members have a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For unavoidable reasons I was unable to be present in the House when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken on the motion for the second reading of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is my intention not to <span class="highlight">vote</span> to support the downgrading of women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rather hope that the majority of members of this Parliament are prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of this amendment to ensure, if in fact there is some doubt about it, as I believe there is, the rights and the protection of women under this new Family Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The redistributions are doubly bad, because when the Government talks about the idea of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value- high sounding remarks- it means that the electorates biggest in size also have the biggest enrolments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that a redistribution is being carried out which will require an abnormal percentage of the votes to put the present Government out of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Each State must be voted upon separately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In any one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, the legislation with regard to a State may be rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While taking this opportunity to reiterate the Government’s determination to uphold the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, I also remind honourable members that under the Act as amended it remains possible for the Distribution Commissioners to fix the boundaries for divisions in a way which would result in enrolments varying from the State quota by up to 10 per cent, that is to say, an overall variation of up to 20 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel sorry for those who come from Queensland and for the attitude which they may adopt to electoral reform, because the Premier of that State sits on 19 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and still becomes the Premier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking the seats separately, in an all percentage <span class="highlight">vote</span> in that State the Liberal Country League is advantaged by 1.5 per cent of the total State <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In relation to charges about previous elections reflecting accurately the <span class="highlight">vote</span> which was given to the various parties, it is suggested that because in 1974 the Labor Party received as a second preferred <span class="highlight">vote</span> 51.7 per cent of the votes, that it is fair and equitable that we receive 52 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party and the National Country Party which received 48.3 per cent of the votes received 48 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal-Country Party received 49.8 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and 66 seats or 52.8 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party received 50.2 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and 59 seats or 47.2 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1963 the present Opposition which was then led by  Sir Robert  Menzies on a second preferred <span class="highlight">vote</span> received 52.6 per cent of the votes and had a majority of 22 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1972 on a second preferred <span class="highlight">vote</span> we received 52.7 per cent of the votes and had a majority of 9 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people who were persuaded, for environmental reasons and for a host of other reasons, to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Australian Labor Party at the last election have regretted doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1972 the Australian Labor Party received 49.6 per cent of the first preference <span class="highlight">vote</span> and 52.8 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1974 it received 49.3 per cent of the first preference <span class="highlight">vote</span> and 52 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party is now trying to bring about a system that exists perhaps in the United Kingdom whereby the Labour Party is polling a little over 30 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and is in power with a very substantial majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ultimate result of the present proposals on a national basis would be that the Australian Labor Party would have a majority of five after attaining 45 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> instead of a majority of five after attaining 49.3 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So let us not confuse a political statement by the Leader of the Liberal Party in South Australia- it is a very conservative statement; the future will have to prove this- with the fact that although the redistribution in South Australia has been termed in many areas as the fairest of the State’s redistributions, on my figuring it will still take 53 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Liberal Party to get 50 per cent of the seats- of course we will exceed that by far- and it will still take only 47 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>, on my reckoning, for the Labor Party to get 50 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can produce facts and figures to show that a national <span class="highlight">vote</span> one way will equate with a number of seats for one party; that a national percentage of votes one way will equate conversely with the other party in terms of seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking through the generalities of the redistribution proposals throughout Australia, the Government asks us in those circumstances to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for these proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we do not intend to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that we should say .hat because these electorates are large we should move completely away from the concept of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that provision is coupled with the extra assistance provided to the member with the large electorate, I think that a member can service the needs of his electorate while, at the same time, the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value is adhered to as closely as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw for many years the very unbalanced electoral distribution in South Australia where, despite the fact that the Labor Party could obtain 54 per cent or 55 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>, it was nowhere near able to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It reached the stage where even under the bad proposals that applied, it looked as if, with the gradual increase of the Labor Party <span class="highlight">vote</span>, the Labor Party would be able to govern under the existing scheme, gerrymandered as it was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of the National Country Party members ever talks about the gerrymanders of  Mr BjelkePetersen,  the Premier of Queensland, who wins with 1 9 per cent or 20 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the National Country Party members intend to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against all these proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know full well that the motion will be carried here because the majority of members of this House are exceedingly intelligent and they will support it and <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for the increase in the period referred to by the honourable member- he should have looked at other periods as well- was because of the once only introduction of the 18-year-old <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The University of Tasmania and the College of Advanced Education are situated in the Denison electorate and hence the electorate has a very much higher proportion of 18-year-old voters than does the electorate of Franklin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the increase in population due to the 18-year-old <span class="highlight">vote</span> is a once only change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I condemned it before; I do not believe it should be passed and I hope I get the opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it, not only because of the Bill itself but also because of the impact it has on the Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To <span class="highlight">vote</span> for that motion is to recognise the fundamental thesis behind the recommendations of the Henderson Committee report on this topic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can well see that at the next election I will be sitting in the Parliament with a majority of at least 25 000 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Liberal and National Country Party candidate in the McPherson electorate has never been below about 60 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not reflecting on my friend, the honourable member for Maranoa  (Mr Corbett),  but I think this is discrimination against the people in McPherson, the majority of whom <span class="highlight">vote</span> Liberal, while the majority of people in Maranoa choose to <span class="highlight">vote</span> National Country Party of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National Country Party has 39 members in the House and the Liberal Party 30 notwithstanding the fact that the Liberal Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> was some 30 per cent more than the National Country Party <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hoped that this would be the time when the Liberal Party in this place and in the Senate would stand up in the interests of the Liberal Party voters whom they purport to represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I tell the Liberal Party quite frankly that until it stands up for the democratic principles which it put in its submissions to the Distribution Commissioners but which it runs away from in this House it can only expect to see the Liberal Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Queensland declining in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the comedies in the debate on the redistribution of Queensland into electoral divisions is that the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  stands up time after time and talks about the concept of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my mindcorrect me if I am wrong- one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value means just that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my mind, once we have gone 10 per cent, 5 per cent or even 1 per cent away from the quota the concept of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value no longer exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the National Party immediately announced that they were going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the proposals and reject them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today we have the joint effort of the great partners in the Opposition coalition to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against these proposals which on no honest assessment could be considered to be anything but the most fair and unbiased proposals that could be put forward by any commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of my remarks supporting the redistribution proposals for South Australia I have already commented on the general background to the redistributions which are to be considered for all States other than Western Australia, indicating why the situation is one which cannot be tolerated by any government committed to the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Liberal Party tend to gain a more even spread of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> than either the National Country Party or the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would have supported a fair redistribution based on the broad principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With a minority of the votes they gained a clear majority of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the same <span class="highlight">vote</span>, under the proposed boundaries, they would gain a considerably bigger majority of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have nudged it this way and that, so that with the same <span class="highlight">vote</span> they gain more seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government’s policy is allowed to drift as it has done in the last 2 years I would not be at all surprised in the not-too-distant future to see the absence of all country seats because judging by the number of farmers who have been driven off their properties there would be no one left to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and as a result we would not have any electorates in country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Simple arithmetic shows that this redistribution proposal means that Labor will continue in office with less than 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are the principle of universal suffrage and, most importantly in redistribution matters, the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely the people want the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value because it was an issue at the double dissolution and they voted overwhelmingly for the return of the Government, which supported that principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So do not give us any more talk about one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is- and this explains my stance- that with 45 per cent of the primary <span class="highlight">vote</span> the ALP, under this proposal, could get a majority of 5 seats in the Parliament, yet it would take 55 per cent of the primary <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Liberal Party and Country Party to get the same 5 seats majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His proposals mean that 45 per cent of the primary <span class="highlight">vote</span> will give Labor a 5 seat majority and it will take 55 per cent of the primary <span class="highlight">vote</span> to give the Liberal and National Country Parties a majority of 5 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compare the figures I have just quoted with these figures: Labor won 5 1 per cent of the seats with 49.5 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Labor got into power with 49.5 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will be the first to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a truly fair redistribution when it comes in but this is not a truly fair redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the honourable member for Gippsland intimated that the Australian Labor Party does not have much country <span class="highlight">vote</span> support, but I remind him that we hold about 20 country seats, including Kalgoorlie and Grey, two of the largest country seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think his <span class="highlight">vote</span> in his rural area is as high as his <span class="highlight">vote</span> from the urban areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask him why he does not fight for one in his home State in which his Party and its coalition partner get 45 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and consistently gallop in and take office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Wimmera  (Mr King)  thought Labor would get over 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> under this redistribution and that this would be undemocratic, but why does he not fight with his Party in Queensland for a redistribution there? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they had only themselves to consider they would <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it but, as usual, they carry on their backs the National Country Party of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is, as honourable members opposite know as well as I do, that the National Country Party would never survive on the basis of a popular <span class="highlight">vote</span>; it survives on loaded boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can we beat a candidate who has to receive only 22 per cent of the primary votes to win? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that  Senator Steele  Hall said today: ‘You might as well <span class="highlight">vote</span> for these proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next time two or three Liberals will be wiped out and I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the proposals with the Labor Party in the Senate’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at the National Country Party members, I know why they want a lower <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is so in all those areas to a point that if there were to be another election on these new boundaries the Labor Party could win with a percentage <span class="highlight">vote</span> substantially less than it had at the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the National Country Party and the Liberal Party to beat the Labor Party they would want a greatly increased percentage <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s motives are to reduce the strength and the political voice of country people and to give greater strength to the political voice of city electors, and to Labor Party supporters in particular, by maximising the Labor <span class="highlight">vote</span> in city areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In May last year Labor won 52 per cent of the seats with 49.3 per cent of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition won 48.3 per cent of the seats with 46.8 per cent of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Labor Party’s scheme means that it can stay in office with fewer votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition will need more votes to put the Government out of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some authorities have calculated that the Australian Labor Party will now be able to remain in office with 45 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> while the Liberal Party and the National Country Party will have to gain at least 55 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> to form a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a plot to give equality of representation and to provide as near as practicable a means of ensuring that every <span class="highlight">vote</span> cast will have the same value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be up by 1.2 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had a clear majority of votes, and I would not argue otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under these proposals, with the same <span class="highlight">vote</span>- no extra votes needed- its number of seats would go from 25 to 28 and the Opposition’s share would go down to 1 7 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These proposals in New South Wales are as unacceptable as any proposals could be and both the Liberal Party and the National Country Party will <span class="highlight">vote</span> en bloc to reject them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable members opposite that it is people who <span class="highlight">vote</span>, not boundaries; that it is people who <span class="highlight">vote</span>, not areas; and what democracy is about is people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time we are looking at the situation of allowing people to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One man, one <span class="highlight">vote</span> is the ideal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some places where I get 83 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>; there are other places I go through only at 2 o’clock at night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the last Senate elections on 1 8 May 1 974, the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span>, Australia-wide, averaged 10.77 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The significance of this figure can be appreciated when it is realised that any candidate receiving just over 9 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in any particular State would have been elected to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would allow a significant extension of the choices available to the voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It maintains all of the choices open to electors under the full preferential system but expands this range of choice by not forcing electors to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for candidates about whom they know nothing, or towards whom they are positively hostile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would simplify the act of voting, and would reduce substantially the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span>, particularly in Senate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my own Division of Grayndler, an informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> of 16.1 per cent was recorded at the Senate elections last year and that figures was even higher in some other divisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The time is overdue for change -a change to a more democratic electoral system which would not disfranchise such a large number of voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were more than threequarters of a million informal votes at the May 1974 Senate elections- 798 126 to be precise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Opposition Parties have exploited the present alphabetical principle so as to ensure that their candidates are placed on the ballot papers ahead of the Australian Labor Party’s candidates so that they may obtain the benefit of what is often called the ‘donkey’ <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A common form of abuse is for party workers to compile lists of electors who voted by post at the previous election and then forward to all such people semi-completed postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> application forms in the hope of influencing voters to support a particular party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has only to look at the percentage of postal votes which favour the Liberal and Country Parties to realise which parties are responsible for most of these abuses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has proposed to inhibit such malpractices by preventing party workers from examining the lists of names of postal voters, except when this is absolutely necessary for an inquiry into an alleged or suspected contravention of the Act or for a petition to a Court of Disputed Returns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have proposed to give the Chief Australian Electoral Officer power to vary the form of postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> applications at each election to prevent the dubious practice of stockpiling partially completed forms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The results of this campaign were particularly noticeable on the New South Wales Senate ballot papers where voters were required to rank up to 73 candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would have effectively reduced the number of frivolous candidates, without affecting the candidates of the major political parties, and enabled more electors to register a formal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He talked about abuse of the postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last election the Australian Labor Party received 49 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and a small majority of five in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why do we need changes in boundaries which, of course, would give the Australian Labor Party in most of the States a potential proportion of seats greatly in excess of the Party’s potential proportion of votes, if we base that on the figures at the last 2 elections in 1 972 and 1 974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister talked about the very high informal votes in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely to heaven, it would be a brave man who would try to claim that a change in the system will really reduce very much the number of informal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although he talked about right wing candidates and all that sort of emotive stuff, the fact of the matter is that the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> percentage on the last election was not greatly different from that in previous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the new boundaries are presented to Parliament, every Country Party member and  Senator will  <span class="highlight">vote</span> against their implementation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill was passed by the House in July last year, but failed on 26 February this year, on a tied <span class="highlight">vote</span>, to receive a second reading in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that those Commissioners who have interests in other matters- that is, matters that other organisations are concerned about, such as those Commissioners who might represent the National Trust or otherwise- are not permitted to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to say too that having voted on the principle in this one of 4 areas, the Opposition will not pursue the proposed amendments on this matter and ask for them to be put to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>; we will simply confine our debate to representative clauses of the areas that we wish to see amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly hope that, before the colleagues in the other place of Opposition members here come to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue they will give it a little more thought than has obviously been given by the gentlemen sitting opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I give these figures most honourable members will be a little hesitant to agree to the Bill except in a changed form based on the amendments which we on this side of the House favour and are prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For my part, I propose to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Bill as it is brought in, and I strongly oppose the amendments which are being moved from this side of the House, with one exception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am prepared to let that contemporary Senate register its opinion and its <span class="highlight">vote</span> on whether these redistributions are fair and reasonable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were rejected by the Senate by the combined <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Australian Labor Party and the Democratic Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Opposition will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against these 5 Bills both in this House and in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that the National Country Party has said that it will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against any redistribution proposals which carry out the present law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is one simple question for the Opposition, or for the Liberal partner which has surrendered so abjectly to the Country Party: How can they justify to their own supporters a situation where the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of an elector in Bonython is to be valued at less than half that of an elector in Wakefield? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To put it another way, a Labor voter in Wakefield is worth twice as much as a Liberal in Bonython. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> of a South Australian is to be valued not by party but by place of residence, not by for whom he votes but by where he votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let the Leader of the Opposition justify to the people of Diamond Valley why their <span class="highlight">vote</span> is debased to scarcely one half the value of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of a person living elsewhere in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have jointly voted against the motion for the second reading of the Bill concerning the South Australian proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will jointly <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the motion for the second reading of the Bills concerning the proposals for Tasmania, Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will jointly <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the proposals when they go into the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister talks of numbers and of the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value yet this redistribution stands in stark contrast with all of those pious platitudes that he has expressed because the value of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is equally destroyed if many people in vast areas of Australia are effectively denied access to their parliamentary representative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>There is an area south of Brisbane that is composed of sensible people who <span class="highlight">vote</span> very solidly for the National and Liberal Parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I wipe my mind quite clear of any impure motives when I <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the redistribution Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it a little difficult to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The seat of Flynn will have an adequate number of voters because it occupies about 19 degrees of longitude and about 18 degrees of latitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against that redistribution either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the basic proposition on which redistributions will be looked at if they are in a narrow interest, but if they are in the wider interest such as the one which occupies our minds completely we say that we will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the redistribution for Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not democratic to have virtually equal numbers of voters in all electorates when electorates vary so much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are chasing an elusive concept of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we wanted one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value in the strictest sense, we would have a census today, an electoral redistribution tomorrow and an election the next day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On numerous occasions figures have been given to demonstrate the number of seats won by the Government and the Opposition compared with the number of votes gained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1974 the Labor Party polled 49.3 per cent of the votes and it won about 52 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Government is saying to this Parliament and to the Australian people is: We want a redistribution that will allow us to obtain only 45 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and maintain our present number of seats and our position in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want a system that will allow the Liberal Party and the National Country Party to poll between them 54.5 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and yet remain in Opposition’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this redistribution does take place, I will have extra burdens placed upon me; but I feel that the extra burdens are more than compensated for by the implementation of my belief in the concept of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will stick by my beliefs and not try to muck around with the Australian electoral system or maintain a system that gives the National Country Party about 17 or 18 per cent of the seats with about 9 per cent of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Liberal Party had any sense of responsibility towards its own members and the people who <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it at elections it would not have anything to do with the Country Party on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concept of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value seems no longer to mean anything to the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If members of the Liberal Party, particularly those from the State of Victoria, have been reading the editorials that have been appearing in the newspapers over the past few weeks they would have seen that people who do not agree with the Australian Labor Party on many other issues believe that the virtues of the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value are still important in the sort of democracy in which we live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Minister continually says that the raison d’etre of this legislation is the desire to implement the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under these proposals there will be a division right through the centre, with the result that half of the people may <span class="highlight">vote</span> for me and the other half may <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a marked increase in the population; there has been an alteration to the Commonwealth Electoral Act to provide for 18-year-olds to <span class="highlight">vote</span> instead of having to wait until they reach 2 1 years of age; and migrants have been given the right to obtain citizenship after 3 years residence in Australia instead of having to wait for 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By putting them into legislative form we can have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of this Parliament and the people can ultimately judge whether they should be passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer to that is not loaded electorates, not giving a country man a <span class="highlight">vote</span> worth 1  Vi  to 2 times the value of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of a city dweller. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has the largest population and the largest number of voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the opportunity to point out that this is yet another indication of the aim of the Prime Minister to get his way, come what may, and in spite of what may be the clear indication of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Australian people and indeed of the sentiment of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only time it would not lead to an election would be when the party of the majority was able to find another leader that it would stand behind so that there would be no need for it to go to the people for an election to determine which party or parties should have the majority and indeed which leader should get a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">vote</span> of confidence is a confidence to form a government and to carry on a government; it is not a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of confidence in every item in the party platform, as our present Prime Minister never fails to claim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the people already have voted against the proposition contained in this Bill, we see no reason why we should accept it now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We reject the Bill and will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it and the Senate will not pass it because the Opposition Parties there have sufficient numbers to see that it is not passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian people already have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> frequently because they are also called upon to elect members to the Parliaments of their States, in some States, for 2 Houses at different times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a senseless and very costly procedure to ask them to <span class="highlight">vote</span> twice for the Federal Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were told that in any case there was no need to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it because a double dissolution would solve the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people just will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for constitutional changes that will have the effect of reducing the power of the Senate which will be to the Senate’s disadvantage and to the disadvantage of this country insofar as its administration and law are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I looked at this proposal I had to ask myself, first of all, what explanation has the Prime Minister given when he has come to this House on 3 occasions and tried to persuade us and the people of the country to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this kind of constitutional change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And to repeal an Act of Parliament should it be passed, when they have, the chance to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it at a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable members who are trying to interject obviously do not believe in democracy and that the people in the electorate who cast any sort of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> count for much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In only one State was the number of votes in favour of the proposed law greater than those against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>There the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour was less than the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span>- about 30 000 votes as against 40 000 informal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, having had a significant <span class="highlight">vote</span> cast against him and having failed in his first attempt to persuade either this Parliament or the people of Australia that he was right on that occasion, he now decides that he will treat the people and the Parliament with complete contempt and re-submit the measure for another referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the face of the Government trying to improve its electoral fortunes and to change the electoral laws in its favour, it is quite silly to say that because we object to the Bill and <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it in this House and in the Senate that is obstructionism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Or is it, as the Opposition believes, that the Labor Party is not favoured by late postal votes and that at election after election those Australians who use their right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> by postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> tend to favour the non-Labor parties and therefore the Government would like to cut them out? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The great value of that system of full preference voting- I am not going to get into a discussion of voting systems and counting systems in any great detail- is that every person who casts a <span class="highlight">vote</span> has a say in who the elected candidate is, once the 2 major contenders, the 2 most favoured candidates, are known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On a personal basis, I was very disappointed that some groups have said that my not recording a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Opposition’s approach to clause 28 when it was debated in the House was due to some reluctance to be totally in favour of the Opposition’s position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition still wants the amendment to be included and will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the resolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  stood in the Evans Deakin shipyard- I have repeated this in the House on 2 previous occasions- and said to the men: ‘If you want to work, <span class="highlight">vote</span> for us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition again opposed the Bill in the Senate and the motion for the second reading of the Bill resulted in a tied <span class="highlight">vote</span> on 26 February this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Prime Minister has already passed a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence in his Ministry, but the wool growing community and the Australian taxpayers cannot be subjected in considerable financial transactions to this type of speculative endeavour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first proposal was for a corporation of 10 members- 3 farmers, 2 manufacturers, but five members appointed by the Government, with the  chairman  having a casting <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No doubt the Attorney-General will again blush at the ringing <span class="highlight">vote</span> of confidence that we have in his discretion in these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be that he was referring to the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Constitution Alteration (Sumultaneous Elections) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such legislation, of course, has to be passed by an absolute majority of the House and every member of the Government Party voted- except you,  Mr Speaker,  of course, you being in the chair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people of the Northern Territory, who were probably more concerned with the rights of Aborigines than were people in any other community in Australia, were denied the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at that referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were carrying banners demanding the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We marched to what would have been the electoral office if we had been entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in that referendum and hammered on the door; no one replied, so we spent the rest of the day getting citizens of that area to sign a petition which was presented to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That petition asked that citizens in the Northern Territory have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that electors of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory will not be entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the referendum proposed for 8 December 1973? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the referendum questions put as a result of the passage of that legislation, Territorians could have been granted the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a referendum proposing laws to alter the Constitution were it not for the third question in respect of that referendum proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that question had been omitted and the remaining questions agreed to Territorians would have had the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of restricting the Bill and the subsequent referendum questions to the rights of people in the Territories to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referenda, the Government added a third question which had heavy implications which the people of the States just could not possibly accept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that question had been omitted and the remaining questions agreed to, Territorians would have gained the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referenda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government was endeavouring through that additional question to alter the specification of the majority of States required to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a referendum proposal for that proposal to be carried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of the ^States said by their <span class="highlight">vote</span> that they would not go along with that proposal because the Government was trying to change the four-two majority of States required for a referendum to be carried to a three-three <span class="highlight">vote</span> among the States, on which <span class="highlight">vote</span> a referendum question would be declared to be carried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s ‘gift’ to the Northern Territory of the right of Territorians to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums was tied to this additional proposal which had the effect of a heavy stone on those proposals; the proposals sank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While pressing for the right of people in the Northern Territory to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums, I stress that the newly elected Legislative Assembly is being by-passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One such matter could be amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act in support of the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of the Northern Territory, the people of northern Australia and the people of all of Australia who have any sense of balance would see that it is obvious that the right to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in any referendum held in this country should be given to the people of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Knowing that  Senator Gair  was no longer eligible to be a member of the Senate, the Government permitted  Senator Gair  to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Senate and took no action until it had to make a statement about his appointment as Ambassador to Ireland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On diplomatic asylym, Australia was instrumental in securing the adoption by the General Assembly by a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of 110-0-16 of resolution 3321 (xxix) which invited Member States wishing to express their views on the question of diplomatic asylum to communicate those views to the SecretaryGeneral not later than 30 June 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-142-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My point has a very great relevance to whether or not we should <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the nominee from the Government side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That in no way indicates ill will to the honourable member who has won the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must confess that when one of the Government supporters walked across the aisle just a few moments after the <span class="highlight">vote</span> had been taken my heart rose and I thought: ‘Ah, it has happened at last’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the optional preferential system one had only to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on a group basis for one candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-The Opposition will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that a resolution was passed in relation to this matter and that it was carried by a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of something like 22 to 18, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Curtin  (Mr Garland),  but I really do not think that that sort of selective choosing of the actions of a particular branch of the Party really contributes very much to the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition does not intend to change its attitude in this place on the Senate’s amendment and will accordingly <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the motion moved by the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I think that it would be an important contribution to alacrity in this matter if the Opposition did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the motion and if we relayed to the Senate the unanimous view of this House that the Committee should get on with the job as it was defined by this House in the first place and that the function, the subject of the Senate’s resolution, be returned to the respective House committees to establish the accommodation needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I thought that we had gone a long way when this matter was decided by a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on nonparty lines; undoubtedly this delaying tactic will upset our hopes and aspirations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be remembered that at the Constitutional Convention in September 1973 I put the proposition that the aldermen and councillors in each State should be entitled to elect a person to speak and <span class="highlight">vote</span> for them on the Loan Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposed simplified system of preferential voting would enable a voter to place a No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>1 beside the name of the candidate he most prefers, to have his <span class="highlight">vote</span> counted and, if necessary, to have his preferences distributed in the recommended manner, without the need to number each square. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a distribution of preferences became necessary the votes of the candidate to whom the No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 <span class="highlight">vote</span> was given would be counted in accordance with the recommendations of the candidate ‘s how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> card. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I have said is that if the voter wants to record his preference in some other way he should still have the right to do so by placing a number in each square according to his preference, as at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What I have said is that, in either event, a voter should have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for an individual candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The American delegation walked out, calling the <span class="highlight">vote</span> a tragic decision because the PLO was a political, not a labour, entity under the ILO chaner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is significant that in this Parliament, including in the Senate, there has not been opposition by way of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to programs which have, however, been challenged in the courts by State Liberal governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is true of almost every <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that there is a <span class="highlight">vote</span> or two in that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition put up a  speaker  who was Treasurer so far back that he is hardly remembered and whom the Opposition does not even consider to be worth a <span class="highlight">vote</span> as a member of its shadow cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The consequence is that their ballot papers are rejected as informal and their votes are wasted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the last Senate elections on 18 May 1974, the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span>, Australia-wide, averaged 10.77 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In New South Wales, where there were 73 candidates, the average informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> was as high as 12.31 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard  for the benefit of honourable members, a statement provided by the Chief Electoral Officer showing the percentage of informal votes recorded at the 1974 Senate election in each State and in each electoral division throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, largely because of the failure of the previous government to take sound equipment decisions in its last years of office, the resources devoted to capital items in the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>, namely equipment and infrastructure, have been falling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of these 2 trends the proportion of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> devoted to capital items had fallen to a quite unacceptably low level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These steps have succeeded in reducing the proportion of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> allocated to manpower from 6 1 per cent in the 1973-74 financial year to 56 per cent in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This increased efficiency has contributed towards the Government’s dramatic increase in the proportion of expenditure devoted to equipment in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Details of the third important component of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>, namely defence facilities, are given in a document which I ask the permission of the House to have incorporated in  Hansard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it agreeable that the percentage of defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> upon equipment is up, but it deserves to go up further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although far fewer candidates stand for House of Representatives elections than for Senate elections, the underlying principle that electors should not be compelled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for candidates for whom they have no preference still applies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that if all voters deliberately refrained from expressing any preferences beyond the first preference, the result under optional preferential voting in an election for a member of the House of Representatives would be the same as in a first past the post system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The results of elections of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly, the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and, more recently, the South Australian Legislative Council, indicate that a majority of electors voting under an optional preferential system will express preferences beyond the minimum number required to cast a formal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, they are so recognised and it cannot be denied that a large number of the electors <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the candidate representing the political party of their choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We intend therefore by this Bill to assist the electors to knowingly record their votes, particularly in circumstances where they are uncertain of, or unable to ascertain, the political affiliations of the candidates appearing on the ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many local government polls also close at 6 p.m. Any argument that this proposed measure would disfranchise farmers or adherents of certain religious faiths, or generally inconvenience people who <span class="highlight">vote</span> late in the day, is not persuasive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> facilities are available to electors who, for the various reasons specified in the Electoral Actincluding religious reasons- will be precluded from voting at a polling booth on polling day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Absent voting facilities enable electors who are outside their subdivision on polling day to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at any other polling place in the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These faculties, together with the availability of modern day private and public transport, are adequate to enable electors to conveniently record their votes, and effectively eliminates the need to keep the polling booths open until 8 p.m. A by-product of the earlier closing hour is that the scrutiny can commence 2 hours earlier with the result that the counting trend for which the nation is waiting is known much earlier in the night of polling day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Irrespective of what time polling booths are closed, there will always be people who <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the last minute or attempt to <span class="highlight">vote</span> too late. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The socalled ‘donkey <span class="highlight">vote</span>’ does exist and it does give advantage to the candidate who enjoys the top position on the ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>without an application from the electors concerned; substituting ‘8 kilometres’ for ‘5 miles’ as the requisite qualifying distance in order to apply for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>; changing from 21 years to 18 years the qualifying age for appointment of Presiding Officers and Assistant Presiding Officers; providing a defence against prosecution where a candidate unwittingly makes a donation to a club or association etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>within 3 months of polling day; amending the provisions relating to misleading representation of a ballot paper; providing redress for candidates against misleading propaganda distributed to voters; limiting the provisions concerning the signing or authorisation of newspaper articles on the occasion of an election to the period ending with the close of the poll in lieu of the period ending with the return of the writ; requiring an announcement on a broadcasting or television station to be made in a clear and undistorted manner and removing the need for the address of the author to be broadcast or televised; changing to metric measurements the standard measurements in relation to size of electoral posters; enabling the posting up or exhibition within a hall used in connection with an election or referendum an electoral poster irrespective of size; changing to metric measurement the distance relating to canvassing near polling booths; limiting the application of the offence of disorderly behaviour at lawful public political meetings to meetings held on or after the date of the issue of the writ and before the close of the poll (in lieu of the date of the return of the writ). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill, the last in the series of Bills incorporating proposals previously contained in the Electoral Laws Amendment BUI, provides for: A speedier finalisation of election results, by introducing an earlier deadline for the return of postal votes and by providing for the return of postal votes direct to the respective returning officer; prohibition on the listing of names of persons who apply for postal votes, except in certain specified circumstances; restriction of postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> application forms to be used at an election or referendum to those specified by notice in the Australian Government Gazette; postal voting faculties for prisoners who have retained their franchise entitlements; discretion to appoint a licensed or registered surveyor as a Distribution Commissioner in lieu of the Surveyor-General of the State concerned; and other minor amendments to the existing electoral law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a growing tendency for party workers to take advantage of the existing provision which enables a person to examine the postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> applications in the office of a divisional returning officer, to compile a list of electors who voted by post at the election and to use this list to forward postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> applications to the persons concerned at the next election, without knowing whether those persons are still eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span> by post. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government proposes to inhibit such malpractices by preventing party workers from examining lists of names of postal voters, except when this is necessary for an inquiry into an alleged or suspected contravention of the Act or for a petition to a Court of Disputed Returns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also proposed to give the Chief Australian Electoral Officer power to vary the form of postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> applications at each election, in order to prevent the dubious practice of stockpiling par.tially completed forms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this proposal the Chief Australian Electoral Officer will specify by a notice in the Gazette the postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> applicanon forms which may be used at an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed too that provision be made enabling a person who is serving a sentence of imprisonment to apply for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>, provided that such a person is still qualified for enrolment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The social welfare <span class="highlight">vote</span> has increased from $1.1 79m to $1.595m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There have been increases in the <span class="highlight">vote</span> for emergency housing, pensioners’ rent rebates, emergency housekeeping and in the expenditure for orphans and government wards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Somebody- perhaps it was the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)realised  that votes were to be won and lost at the centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suspect that a very high proportion of those who do not <span class="highlight">vote</span> are among the truly underprivileged in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is probable that few of the swinging voters are to be found among those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They either <span class="highlight">vote</span> as they have always voted or else do not <span class="highlight">vote</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Big companies do not have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and they can be controlled to a large extent by legislation if a government makes up its mind to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do have a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and there are hundreds of thousands of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was it not a breach of convention and an act of outright dishonesty and deception to allow a man to sit and <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Senate knowing that he was no longer a member of the Senate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the Government that can have a Minister subjected to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence in the Senate and yet that Minister ignores all convention and stays in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has given his Party members a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue but he should have been prepared to show the quality of leadership that we could have expected from him at one time before he became completely subdued by the Premier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should have ensured that there was a Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> from the Liberal <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be clearly understood by aU honourable members before they <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue today that, if they intend to stick by the principle that has been expounded by the Leader of the National Country Party  (Mr Anthony),  who suggested that the Queensland Premier wishes to send a Labor senator to replace the late  Senator Milliner  in this Parliament that can be done only by members in the State Parliament and by themselves here today supporting the election of  Dr Mai  Colston. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the House: How will the Government <span class="highlight">vote</span> in respect of the amendment of substance, moved by the Leader of the National Country Party and seconded by me, which reflects the truth of the situation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed if the Government so truculently claims to have a mandate to implement virtually any whim or dogma, surely it should accept that it has a mandate or contract to keep its word and to keep faith with the Australian people whose <span class="highlight">vote</span> it courted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How could anybody possibly <span class="highlight">vote</span> against such a wonderful government if it performed so well? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will <span class="highlight">vote</span>, according to the interviews he has given, to bring about the destruction of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The impact of this philosophy in political terms can be judged from the experience of Winnett Boyd in Canada when in 1972 he stood as a Conservative Party candidate and increased the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Conservative Party in the constituency from 15 458 to 37 181- reducing the Liberal majority of the Government of Pierre Trudeau by approximately 20 000 votes to only 1847. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But that was voted last year and nothing was done at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there is no new <span class="highlight">vote</span> in that direction and there is no major road building project in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Electors do not have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for those who are elected to the New South Wales Upper House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sitting in the other chamber is a person whose presence directly reflects a rigged <span class="highlight">vote</span> in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because with 19 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> some peanut from Kingaroy became the Premier of that State - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of returning to this Parliament somebody of the same political party as the late  Senator Milliner  for whom the people of Queensland voted in 1974- and I remind the Committee that  Senator Milliner  was a most respected and revered member of the Australian Labor Party- that Premier has returned to the Senate a person who is not a member of the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did so simply because that person said that, if ever he came to the national Parliament, he would <span class="highlight">vote</span> to bring down the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the number required for a quorum in the Parliament should be reduced to about 20 or 25 with a precaution taken that the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on certain measures should be a stipulated number or perhaps a majority of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We could possibly do as other Parliaments do and sit right through the lunch hour or the dinner time with a neutral period like a 6-day bike race when no divisions are called and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> could be taken at a later time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Standing Orders are monument to decisions made in this chamber, mostly on a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have no doubt that the great proportion of the members of the RSL in my electorate probably <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Party that I represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may well be that the members of the RSL in Farrer, for goodness knows whatever reasons, voted for the honourable member for Farrer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact, of course, is that if there is waste and inefficiency it is not the Aboriginal people who cause it or reap its unjust rewards; it is the administrators, consultants and others who are living off the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the same time if there are bodies which are employing only or mainly white people then it is desirable perhaps that that aspect of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> be looked at very carefully <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I commend the Government for the amount of money it is spending- I note that the increase just about breaks even with the inflation rate of 17 per cent- but it is not sufficient just to <span class="highlight">vote</span> large amounts of money and say: ‘There it is’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I warn the people in those electorates that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a Liberal candidate, whether State or Federal, means the extension of Kingsford-Smith Airport and thus the keeping of people awake at night in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What they will have done is not simply wrecked the whole parliamentary system by creating a situation in which any Senate- Labor or Liberal controlled- can force the House of Representatives to an election every six months but also they will have effectively disfranchised approximately half the voters of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet today when a sum of $10m in the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>- in fact it is $ 11.5m when navy and air cadets are added- is part of the consideration not one reference is made to funds, not one reference is made to the effective utilisation of funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are talking about a defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>, about the effectiveness of the way the taxpayers’ money is utilised for the basic purpose of defence, the defence preparedness of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have to calculate, and any responsible government has to calculate, the net advantage within the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the expenditure of not just every million dollars but of every dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have a defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> this year, a very sizeable defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>, of $ 1.800m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have sought to get rid of the superfluous expenditure within that <span class="highlight">vote</span> so that every taxpayer’s dollar spent on defence is used for the primary purpose of any defence budget- the defence preparedness of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was this Minister who, on the arrival of the orphans from Vietnam, cried in front of the public of Australia to try to win cheap votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has tried to narrow this debate purely into a defence argument of whether $10m spent on cadets from a defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> is getting cost effectiveness in the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That, of course, is not the argument here today, The money does not come only from the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a question of how the taxpayer wants his money to be spent, not a question of how the Minister for Defence sees fit to divide up the money given in the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Now through a back door method, using the excuse of financial trickery in the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> itself, the Government has found a reason to disband the cadet corps. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Today we are bringing forward the Bills on the second occasion in this Parliament in order that honourable members might <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, which today I understand will be introduced by way of similar legislation into the South Australian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many voters are disfranchised under the present borders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the electorates in Victoria, we see that the honourable member for Wimmera  (Mr King)  represents 49 700 voters, but that my colleague the honourable member for La Trobe  (Mr Lamb)  supposedly represents 85 000 voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one were to take a real count of the electorate of the honourable member for La Trobe, it would be found that he represents something like 95 000 voters in an area that is partly urban, partly rural and an extremely large area to boot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  represents only 54 000 voters while my colleague, the honourable member for Burke  (Mr Keith Johnson)  has something like 90 000 voters in his electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I endorse the idea that my colleagues on this side of the chamber are better equipped to cope with the extra voters and still give better service, I submit that the voter is entitled to have the value of his <span class="highlight">vote</span> equal to that of every other voter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having put to rest that spurious argument advanced by the Government let us turn to the next argument the Government has often relied on- the famous argument of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the House knows better than most that theoretically you cannot have one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He knows very well that unless you have a totally static population, a population which grows in equal proportion throughout the entire country, you can never have one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, for as soon as you adjust the electoral boundaries on a basis of numerical equality, within a few months they are by normal population trends out of kilter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the proposition about one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value is a spurious one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If indeed the Government is so dedicated to one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value why does it tolerate a situation whereby Tasmanian divisions have on average 15 000 to 20 000 fewer electors than mainland divisions have? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not advocatingindeed the Opposition does not advocate- that the situation should be otherwise, but if the Government is so committed to a principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value why does it not, to be consistent, initiate some amendment to the Constitution to cover that situation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I am on the subject of Tasmania, one of the Bills before the House- in fact, the first one to be voted onproposes a redistribution for the State of Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There does not seem to be any overwhelming one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister knows that in the 1972 and in the 1974 Federal elections the Australian Labor Party polled a clear majority of votes in New South Wales and on both of those occasions the Labor Party won a clear majority of seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time of the 45 New South Wales seats in this Parliament 25 are held by the Australian Labor Party and 20 by the Opposition; rightly so, according to the votes that were cast in May of 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What perhaps some members of the House may not know is that if the proposals submitted to the Distribution Commissioners by the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales- this Party which is so committed to democratic government, which is so committed to one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, which is so committed to electoral justice- were accepted by the Commissioners they would, on the same votes cast in May 1 974, give to the Labor Party in New South Wales 29 seats and not 25 seats and would give to the joint Opposition Parties 16 seats and not 20 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Party would on a repetition of the May 1974 <span class="highlight">vote</span> in New South Wales receive 28 seats to 17 seats to be won by the joint Opposition Parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who would say that has not made a difference to the numbers of electors eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span> since 1968? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real meaning of democracy must surely be one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, or one <span class="highlight">vote</span> of one citizen equal to the value of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of another citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It receives 8 per cent of the Australian <span class="highlight">vote</span> but its representation in this House is double that, and it is able to tell its major partner to keep off its heels, that it is going to run this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party knows, in spite of the stupid arguments its members put forward, that the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value or the principle of a 10 per cent variation in the quota is acceptable to the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people in the country whom I know <span class="highlight">vote</span> for us say that they never see the elected representatives of the National Country Party in the electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose the fact that our <span class="highlight">vote</span> was down to about 52 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span> does come as some sort of shock to a party that is used to getting 56 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But under the Thomas Playford regime that existed in South Australia from 1933 to 1965, we have received up to 57 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and been defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my electorate in South Australia in the last State elections, our <span class="highlight">vote</span> went up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is quite right of course, but more people <span class="highlight">vote</span> Labor each election than for any other party and they have done so in every election bar the one in 1966. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One look at the situation in Queensland, where the State Country Party leader whom I suppose we could call the bastion of democracy rules with 20 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>, shows what the Country Party philosophy really is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He intimated that we should also make seats in Tasmania larger if our argument of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value is to hold water, but the honourable member surely must be aware that the Constitution sets down the minimum number of seats for a State as small as Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, they are looked at to ascertain that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of 50 per cent plus one of the electorate ought to be sufficient to elect the Party receiving that <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Australian history it needs to be recorded that in respect of that second principle only once has a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of 50 per cent plus one not been sufficient to elect to government the Party for which the people voted and that was under the Labor Party’s last successful redistribution for this House in 1 948 and in 1 949. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it very difficult to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this redistribution, but I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it for reasons of Party loyalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, as I have said, out of Party loyalty- and this is a very difficult step to take- I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it ultimately for the reasons which I have indicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overriding principle in any proposal such as this has to be that 50 per cent plus one of the total Australian electorate ought to have its <span class="highlight">vote</span> recorded for the Party which it seeks to elect to office or the Party which is currently in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think the background of some of the past experiences which could drive one to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in another way should be appreciated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Everybody knows that when there is one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value intelligent people, unless they are rigged, would not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the collection which is supposed to represent the country people in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1 972 they got 9 per cent of the votes and they got 16 per cent of the power in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apparently the right honourable member considers that the Queensland redistribution at least is an unreasonable one because he did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Government claim that the United States of America has always had the one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value concept? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the fact that the proposals are fair, reasonable and honest, will not disadvantage any Party and will give reasonable representation as close as possible to the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, we cannot allow you to support the redistribution’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The clear purpose of coming to this Parliament is to cast a conscious <span class="highlight">vote</span>, because ostensibly, each of us represents as near as is practicable the same number of people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government as a whole has always said that it wants to give equal representation to the people of Australia and yet when it comes to the voter who happens to reside in an area outside the metropolitan area, it does not give him true and equal representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1972 the Labor Party polled 49.6 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> but won 52.8 per cent of the seats, and that was under the former Liberal-Country Party Government redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1974 Labor polled 49.3 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> but won 52 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The redistribution proposals that the Labor Party is now putting to us under the criteria that it has laid down would bring about a situation in which Labor would win with a majority of five if it polled 45 per cent of the total Australian <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this redistribution the Labor Party would win with a majority of five after polling 45 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> instead of a majority of five after having polled 49.3 per cent of the overall <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A former leader and Prime Minister of this country, the right honourable member for Higgins  (Mr Gorton)  has voted in this Parliament in support of these proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We on this side of the Parliament believe, as do all democrats, that the value of a man’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> should not depend on where he lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How many more times must persons on this side of the House bring to this Parliament the question of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value and be told that there is no mandate for it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will go further and say that I believe that people these days ought to be able to travel a few miles to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can see no reason for maintaining at great expense polling places throughout areas where people probably will drive 20 miles to have a beer on a Saturday afternoon but will not go in to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we look at the education <span class="highlight">vote</span>, we find for instance that the amount spent on government schools in the States has risen from a nominal $288m to $299.7m, which is an increase of 4. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">vote</span> should be available to people in every area and in every electorate, not just to those who live on the Australian seaboard or within areas where there are good communications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope you will at least consider my prediction that if you take, or attempt to take, the Prime Minister’s office by the device of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Senate, your leadership capacity will automatically degenerate to the disadvantage of the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The examples I am going to give are examples of the way we tend to treat conservation as a subject for <span class="highlight">vote</span> catching, something to make stirring speeches about instead of doing something about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister no doubt will say that there is another alternative and that a person can make a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those of us who know the postal service that looks after Oodnadatta will know that if a person living in Oodnadatta does everything exactly right and his footwork is impeccable, he can perhaps apply for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But a person who lives 60 or 70 miles out on a station, say, at Mount Darah, cannot ever <span class="highlight">vote</span> again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Either he did or he did not know what he was doing, but any Minister who can deliberately set to work to disenfranchise a small section of the community- there may not be many of them and they may <span class="highlight">vote</span> against his Party- is doing a scandalous thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he please stand up and say how the people who live 20, 30 or 50 miles out of Oodnadatta, who get mail once a fortnight, are going to apply for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> at <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because the Minister and people like him have set to work to see that these people will never get a <span class="highlight">vote</span> again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let him tell me why the people who live 30 miles out of Oodnadatta will never <span class="highlight">vote</span> again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the case of the electorate of Wakefield, some electors will have to travel, as the honourable member for Wakefield said, over 270 miles to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and return 270 miles home after having done so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In times of wet weather the only way people will be able to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a federal election from now on will be to walk, to go on horseback or by a 4-wheel drive vehicle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Services and Property would be well aware that the people who cast their votes in some of these isolated areas are not favourably disposed towards this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we find that a great number of them in difficult circumstances are being deprived of their democratic entitlement to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who live in those areas should have the same entitlement to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> as the people who live in Grayndler at the back door of the Minister himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is why they <span class="highlight">vote</span> for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the electors concerned can travel 20 miles to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If people cannot <span class="highlight">vote</span> because of bad roads, they should blame the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People in his electorate rush 500 miles to a polling place to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for him because they know he is worth voting for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think that any area with a population of fewer than 100 voters should not have a polling place; those people can <span class="highlight">vote</span> by lodging a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would drive 20 miles to have a beer, so why should he not <span class="highlight">vote</span> while he is there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If his electors cannot get to a polling place to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, they should <span class="highlight">vote</span> to get a new member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If roads in his electorate have not been improved in the 23 years that his Government was in office, why should they <span class="highlight">vote</span> for him- by postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> or otherwise- in the future? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member had voted to support the proposed redistribution of boundaries in South Australia, in future Frome North would have been represented by a Labor member, the honourable member for Grey  (Mr Wallace). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, if the honourable member for Wakefield does not want to be bothered with those electors and if he thinks that they will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for him because there is no polling place there, he should <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the proposed redistribution to give those people the chance to elect a decent Labor member instead of somebody like the honourable member for Wakefield who launches bitter personal attacks under the guise of doing something for his electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that each <span class="highlight">vote</span> should be of equal value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I introduced legislation to double the number of polling places throughout Australia, every honourable member opposite would <span class="highlight">vote</span> against that legislation because they are opposed to every electoral reform that has ever been brought in in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the people there are so fair dinkum that they will go 100 miles to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a Daly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again I would like the Minister to tell the House what is in his mind in regard to the triennial <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members opposite will never get over the shock to their system when this Government gave 18- year-olds the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The bulk of the services in that <span class="highlight">vote</span> of $ 137m cover the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, the Australian Government Publishing Service, the Australian Office of Information and what we now call the publication inquiry centres which were previously the bookshops. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the reduction in and the elimination of postal services the people will be deprived of their franchise- they will not be able to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In seeking a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of this magnitude the Government is allocating substantial resources to this Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a right to know what has happened to money which we have voted or which we may be called upon to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said at the outset in my remarks on this measure, the Opposition while supporting the principle involved in the Bill and while acknowledging- as the Prime Minister pointed out during his second reading speech- that during the past few years there have been general expressions of support for the idea contained in this measure from various State governments, State premiers and political parties across the whole spectrum in Australia, is very strongly of the view that until the attitude of the 6 State governments on the specific terms of this Bill are made known to the Parliament then the Bill ought not to be present to this House for a second reading <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister during his second reading speech was not able to establish to the satisfaction of the Opposition why it was necessary or why it might be necessary for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be taken on this Bill in advance of detailed responses from the States being obtained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I think the Opposition is entitled to ask the Government to explain why it might be necessary to take a second reading <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this measure only a little over a week after it was first introduced into this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a measure which, if carried into force by <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the people, will have a long and far-reaching effect on the respective rights and responsibilities not only of this Parliament but also of the Parliaments of the various States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in those circumstances the Opposition believes that it is entitled to ask the Government and this House to consider whether this Bill should be voted on until the views of the States on the measure are obtained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The three of those need a great deal of examination before we will satisfy people’s minds that they can readily and properly <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a referendum for this change to the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would therefore suggest that the proper course for us today is to consider the matter of principle as we are now doing at the second reading stage and the matter should then be put to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the second reading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event, section 128 provides that there must be not only a majority of Australians <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a proposal- I would have thought that that was enough; perhaps one could want a majority in each State or something of that sort- but that there must be a majority in a majority of the States in support of a proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that we will pass the second reading of the Bill when it is put to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, that we will go into Committee and then, perhaps, move that progress be reported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason the Opposition would support and <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the second reading of this BUI. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if the Government uses its numbers in this House to defeat the amendment, as is likely, then the Opposition, as I have said, will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the second reading: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic fairness of that is this: If he votes No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2 for candidates who, as it turns out when the votes are counted, are less favoured candidates, then, if he has to fill in the whole of the ballot paper, ultimately he has a say in determining which of the two most favoured candidates comes last or, in the case of the Senate, the two most favoured teams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the inherent fairness of that system and that is why Australia, which when its electoral systems were being set up was naturally interested in trying to achieve the fairest system- by the way, Australia was one of the first countries to give the <span class="highlight">vote</span> to women and also to provide for secret ballots- adopted the system of full preferential voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So members of the Labor Party come along here with a lot of spurious arguments about the percentage of informal votes and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course there will always be a number of electors who fail to record a valid <span class="highlight">vote</span> irrespective of the voting system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me refer to this matter of the average informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Senate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us all agree that because of the large number of candidates for Senate elections and perhaps in many cases because of the number of candidates whose names are not well known, there will be a significant number of people who will <span class="highlight">vote</span> informally either unintentionally or intentionally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> at Senate elections is about 10 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have in front of me the percentages of informal votes recorded at Senate elections since 1949. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of the fact that one State had, I think, 73 candidates, the fact of the matter was that the overwhelming majority of electors were able to work out quite easily how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> formally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A blank ballot paper shows that it is not a question of somebody making a mistake and having his <span class="highlight">vote</span> ruled out; he does not want to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will always be a percentage of those deliberately informal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who can say, with the Government’s interest in promoting propaganda in its own direction, what campaign would be waged, if that system were adopted, in favour of greatly simplifying the system, as the Government would say, and encouraging people just to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Labor Party team and for no one else? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say in respect to this Bill, and with more relevance in respect of a Bill to be dealt with later, it is important that individuals have the right of full expression of their <span class="highlight">vote</span> and also the right to nominate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it is stupid to argue that the present system should be maintained because people want to <span class="highlight">vote</span> with all the preferences that are made available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can anyone here from New South Wales tell me how he voted at the last Senate election after the double dissolution in 1 974? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All he knows is that he voted for his own party first and that his first preference was the coalition partner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can work within organisations in which people know everyone, but it is ridiculous to ask the people of New South Wales or of any State in this country seriously to <span class="highlight">vote</span> from No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the last Senate election in New SouthWales there were about 40 party representatives and there were 30 additional candidates who nominated for the sole purpose of trying to manipulate the system because they worked out that the more candidates there were the more chance there was of defeating Labor candidates and that the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> would rise in the Labor-held electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Because if you look at the figures for informal votes in New South Walesyou have looked at them, which is why you are trying to consolidate the present system in its present form- you will find that in the electorates where there was the highest number of informal votes the people who have been penalised are, to be a very large extent, the migrants, the disadvantaged groups and the groups which may have some difficulty in voting from one to seventythree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to cite the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> in some of those electorates: Banks 14.1 per cent; Barton 10 per cent; Chifley 14 per cent; Darling 16 per cent; Cunningham 11.6 per cent; Grayndler 16 per cent; Hunter 15.2 per cent; Kingsford-Smith 13 per cent; Lang 12 per cent; Prospect 14 per cent; Reid 16 per cent and Sydney 20 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those extra 30 candidates in New South Wales, which made a total of seventy-three, contributed to giving Australia the highest informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> we have ever had in a Senate election under the present system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it quite seriously to the House that not only will the system be made inoperable but also we will never be able to count the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people want to exercise their rights to prove a point- I would not suggest that honourable members opposite should laugh- and there are 300 or 400 candidates for the Senate in New South Wales, it will take 6 months for the Electoral Office to count the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That bastion of democracy, the Legislative Council in South Australia, which introduced for the first time at the last State elections a decent system of voting, has now adopted optional preferential voting by which one can <span class="highlight">vote</span> for one’s own team and can then <span class="highlight">vote</span> for all the other teams in order of preference, if one wishes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is incumbent on one to <span class="highlight">vote</span> only for the team one knows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for people of whom they have no knowledge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for teams of which they have never heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for their political party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been the tradition in this country that, apart from the 20 per cent or 25 per cent of the people in the middle who change their votes from election to election, people <span class="highlight">vote</span> out of political persuasion; they <span class="highlight">vote</span> for their political teams and not for individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will recognise their teams and <span class="highlight">vote</span> accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To suggest with any seriousness at all that people <span class="highlight">vote</span> in all conscience from one to seventy-three, as we asked them to do in New South Wales, is absolute rubbish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to raise the question of the counting of votes in accordance with the amending Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In arriving at that quota you take into consideration the number of formal votes cast and also the number of candidates who are to be elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also states that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be classified as formal providing the ballot paper is filled in with the total numbers in accordance with the number of senators to be elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that were the case and we were to elect, say, 5 senators it would be obvious that a number of people could <span class="highlight">vote</span> for candidates who were not even in the final running for election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would automatically disfranchise those people who would cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the candidate in which they would be interested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the years the Government has always talked about equalisation, a fair go for all, one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value and that sort of thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4 and 5 there is every possibility that no formal votes, or very few, would be left. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>5 would be elected with fewer votes than those who would be elected No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is enough to record a valid <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He may well <span class="highlight">vote</span> for somebody who in the event receives few votes and has little hope of being elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the elector votes initially for a minor candidate and gives a preference to the full number of candidates on the ballot paper ultimately his preferences will be distributed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose one would need to qualify that by saying that if a candidate has an absolute majority- that is 50 per cent of the votes plus one- the preferences are not necessary but in most elections they are necessary and in all elections they may be necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the specious arguments used is that the optional preferential system would reduce the number of informal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a list which shows the percentage of informal votes cast in elections in this country since 1949. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between 2 per cent and 3 per cent of voters <span class="highlight">vote</span> informally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one scrutinises the ballot papers when the votes are being counted one sees that some are blank, some are spoiled in other ways and some are amusingly not blank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the point is that some people do not wish to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, there is no law to prevent them from failing to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will always be some people who will <span class="highlight">vote</span> informally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose it is part of their democratic right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in such a manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government really wants to produce a situation in which it can get from a few votes some sort of preferential treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It hopes that some people who <span class="highlight">vote</span> for minor candidates ultimately will not have any preferential say because if this legislation were passsed the Government would further amend the law to provide for first past the voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government would then be able to split the votes of its opponents even though those votes in total might exceed the votes for the Government candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once it has encouraged people not to <span class="highlight">vote</span> fully on the basis of a preferential system it will come back and say: ‘Well, people do not want to use this system; we will change it to a first past the post system’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one compares the percentages of votes that are cast for the Australian Labor Party with the percentages of Labor Party candidates who are elected one will find that the percentages are pretty close. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It so happens that some States are very antagonistic to the Labor Party and if they had not had equality of votes in the Seante they would never have joined the Federation in the first place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, so long as we are to have boundaries anywhere we will not have an exact representation of the percentage <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a party across the whole State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members want an accurate determination of the effect of informal votes on a large number of candidates and of the difference that the optional preferential system will make, it can be found in the figures for the House of Representatives and the Senate in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On an Australia-wide basis, the number of informal votes cast for the House of Representatives was 1.92 per cent of total votes cast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Informal votes for the Senate were 12.3 per cent of the total Senate <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that 10.71 per cent of those who voted in New South <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the week before last the honourable member for Wakefield  (Mr Kelly)  referred to the reduction in the number of polling booths in rural electorates and how by this so-called electoral reform the Government was depriving country people of the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if we look at the high percentage of informal votes cast in country electorates, we find that the National Country Party, and the Opposition in general, are supporting a system which deprives far more country voters of an expression of choice for a candidate than that system of voting does in respect of city voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last Senate election 13 per cent of voters there voted informally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the electorate of Paterson in New South Wales, 15.6 per cent of voters cast informal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The percentage of informal votes in the electorate of Lyne in New South Wales was 16.1 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I compare that level of informal voting with the number of informal votes cast in the electorate of Berowra, a city electorate, which was 7.3 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More than twice as many country voters cast informal votes in the Senate election last year than were cast by city voters in the electorate of Berowra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people do not want to put a number against a candidate under the system which honourable members opposite support, those people lose their right to have that <span class="highlight">vote</span> recorded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us say that we have a constituency of 100 people and that 100 valid votes are cast at a poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Candidate Garland, as I shall call him, receives 41 of those votes by way of first preference, candidate Riordan receives 39 and- I will be modest- candidate Howard received only 20 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the 20 people who voted for Howard, the problem is that only ten decided to express a preference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So Garland ends up with 47 votes and Riordan with 43 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, by way of first or subsequent preference, Garland has received only 47 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, 53 per cent of the people who voted in that poll did not want Garland although he is declared elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the House that the Leader of the House should have further qualified those remarks by saying that if a sufficient number of voters in an optional preferential system refrained from expressing a preference, the result would be the same because the example I have given to the House shows precisely the same effect in that it leads to the election of a person who has received less than 50 per cent of the formal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final question I ask the Government is: If it is wrong to compel people to exercise a preference beyond their first preference, why is it not wrong to compel people to <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find a logical inconsistency in saying that we cannot compel people to exercise a second or subsequent preference but that we can compel people to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Government is really consistent and if it really believes that we ought not to compel people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> beyond a certain preference, it ought to examine its fundamental commitment to compulsory voting because there is a very strong and logical inconsistency in the approach which it takes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill seeks to do no more than to give voters assistance to make a free and unqualified choice as to who they wish to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for at a particular election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To make it easier for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be formal and counted in an election is apparently a plot by the Australian Labor Party to gain some advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that we get something like six or eight times the number of informal votes when we have a large number of candiates as in the last Senate election in New South Wales as against the last House of Representatives election in New South Wales, apparently fades away into insignificance as far as the Opposition is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation in fact makes it easier for the elector to cast an intelligent <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course I can understand my friends from the National Country Party not wanting that to happen because there would be a few of them who would not be around for long if they got an intelligent <span class="highlight">vote</span> in their electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I accuse the Government of humbug because since this Government came to power it has successfully eliminated no fewer than 900 polling places around Australia thus making it more difficult for thousands of people to cast their votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In South Australia there is the notable case of one polling place being abolished so that now the electors of that small community will have to travel 275 miles to a polling place to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, then come all that way home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is not trying to make it easier for people to <span class="highlight">vote</span>; that is absolute rubbish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not buy the argument that this legislation is trying to make voting easier when a government, at the stroke of a pen, can abolish 900 polling places throughout Australia thus making it more difficult for people, particularly in isolated locations, to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the man who on the last Caucus <span class="highlight">vote</span> was No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If you do not <span class="highlight">vote</span> you are sent a letter asking you to explain and if your reason is not convincing you are fined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we say that in matters such as the number of polling booths, the provision of adequate facilities, particularly with regard to postal votes, and the hours that the booths are open, there is a requirement, a duty, for the Government to provide reasonable convenience to electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, if the time for casting a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, the availability and number of polling booths and the way in which postal votes can be lodged are restricted the rights of the people are restricted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Stirling  (Mr Viner)  and the honourable member for Sturt  (Mr Wilson)  have both been subjected to OUtcomes brought about by what we term in politics the donkey <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In using the term ‘donkey’ I am not referring to the people who cast such votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is simply a fact of “life, accepted by all of us, that some people going to the booths to <span class="highlight">vote</span> will <span class="highlight">vote</span> straight down the ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>infamous days of the late 1950s and 1960s the Democratic Labor Party of Australia, when it was contesting elections, went out of its way at both Federal and State elections to have on ballot papers the names of people whose names began with either A, B or C. In a Federal election that lifted the Party’s percentage of the national <span class="highlight">vote</span> to such an extent that it thought it was a decent, acceptable and some sort of major political party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Appearing at the top of the ballot paper can mean a substantial <span class="highlight">vote</span> in some of the electorates now held by my colleagues in the Australian Labor Party where we are being gerrymandered and where we find 80 000 or 90 000 voters in a single Labor electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position at the top of the ballot paper can be worth between 700 and 1400 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We recall quite vividly a very great member of the Australian Labor Party, Reg Pollard, who was the honourable member for Lalor, losing his position in 1966 not because the people of Lalor consciously did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for rum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He received thousands more primary votes than any of the other candidates, of whom there were twelve or thirteen if my memory serves me correctly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He ended up being beaten for the want of 1 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He still gets the so-called donkey <span class="highlight">vote</span> if he happens to appear above his major opponent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would think from listening to the Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Curtin, that each of us comes here because of our enormous contribution in our own little electorate, that everybody in the electorate knows us and at least 50 per cent plus one <span class="highlight">vote</span> for us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People deliberately set out to manipulate the system to increase the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Labor divisions and so prevent the election of Labor senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has disadvantaged a great number of people in areas such as the electorate of Gwydir who, on wet polling days because there are no all-weather roads, will have to ride to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, go in a 4-wheel drive vehicle or pay the fine for failing to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the closures will effectively do in certain circumstances is disfranchise people who would otherwise be entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, I would recall to honourable gentlemen that the last election for the Senate, the date of which was determined by the Federal Government since it was a double dissolution, more votes were received by the Labor candidates than by the candidates of all other parties combined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot take seriously the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of a body of which 2 members were appointed- not electedand of which another member, who was elected as an independent, chose to join a political party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Government were defeated on any <span class="highlight">vote</span> of confidence in this House I would go to the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, however, so far from being a good cause for its recall, may constitute its greatest claim to reputation, and one of the factors which strengthens the hand of a Government fresh from victory at the polls is that it may look forward to a period of office in which its policy may be dictated by convictions and not by the mere necessity for <span class="highlight">vote</span> catching. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Curtin  (Mr Garland)  said, the Opposition’s proposal would mean that everyone and anyone going abroad for any period, no matter how limited or unlimited that may be, would be entitled to remain enrolled and to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in parliamentary elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One might take the view that a person who was abroad for 20 years would still be entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> even though he were not in the service of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, those who are abroad now are not necessarily denied the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this particular clause the Government is seeking to facilitate the rights of certain citizens to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in parliamentary elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The obvious proposal which comes from the honourable member is that the more voting is facilitated, the more people are able to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, the easier it becomes to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, the fewer informal votes there are, the more this will assist the Government That may well be true, but it is also true that to facilitate the expression of opinion by electors is basic to the democratic concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the Goverment is seeking to do is to say: ‘If you are in the government service abroad you can have a <span class="highlight">vote</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he does have such an intention I think we can regard him as an Australian with a right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After section 88 of the Principal Act the following section is inserted: ‘88a ( 1 ) The Divisional Rewriting Officer for each Division that exceeds 260 000 square kilometres in area shall keep a register, to be called the Register of General Postal Voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have heard in several debates that the Government wishes to facilitate the voting by people at election time, yet so many of its proposals are to restrict it in terms of time or postal votes generally- we will come to that matter when we deal with the next Bill- and in terms of that clause which we last debated providing some people who are living overseas with the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other day he was rather critical of the responsible Minister for closing booths and making it even harder for a group of people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> who I think live 260 miles- or perhaps kilometres- from the next booth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems to be a course of conduct by the Government that it wishes to make it more difficult for people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and to restrict the availability of booths for people, yet at the same time insists that voting is compulsory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course with the Post Office as it is- I do not want to be too rude about its operations but it is common knowledge that some of its transportation of votes is a bit slow- and with the understandable congestion in an electoral office whilst an election is being conducted, I suppose it is not possible to process all of these applications and to sent out ballot papers the very next day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether they drive, ride, walk or crawl they should get there and lodge a valid <span class="highlight">vote</span> because one cannot be sure of the postal voting system operating efficiently, even if one does everything that one can in order to lodge a valid <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course if Government supporters cannot see the sense of having a register to help people to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, I suppose we have little chance of convincing them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that somebody applies once and satisfies the returning officer once that he is entitled to a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> does not necessarily mean that that will be so in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Successive governments have decided, wisely in my view, to ensure that postal voting be kept to those circumstances and cases where people would otherwise be deprived of the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no reason to suggest that a person who lives some distance from a polling place cannot apply for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one reason why people apply for postal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can remember when I narrowly lost an election in 1969 because an extraordinary number of absentee votes came in from a place called Werris Creek which everybody knows is a little railway town in the north-west of New South Wales, not known as a place to which people from Bondi go for their annual holidays. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, these votes all turned up and honourable members would be surprised at the way they went. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At any rate, I do not want to go too far into that except to say there is the prospect of impersonation of voters under the present electoral system and this proposition which is put forward now by the Opposition would make this easier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The person who has a legitimate reason to <span class="highlight">vote</span> by post can make an application and that application will be facilitated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would mean that a person having once got himself on to the register of postal voters would be entitled to stay there almost forever until the returning officer found some reason to take him otT it <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know the old jingle ‘<span class="highlight">vote</span> early and <span class="highlight">vote</span> often’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are talking about is having a separate register for people who are placed in great difficulties in lodging a valid <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Riordan)  put up some argument about what happened in his electorate with absentee votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not talking about absentee votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An absentee <span class="highlight">vote</span> is a <span class="highlight">vote</span> lodged by someone who on the day is in a different electorate than the one for which he is enrolled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a person lodges the <span class="highlight">vote</span> out of his electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He goes through a special procedure because not every electorate or polling booth has a complete list of persons entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are speaking about postal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said there is adequate avenue for people to lodge a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us face it, the slowness of mail deliveries is getting worse and worse so it has particular importance now as against earlier elections in which I suppose the smaller volume of mail, to put the most charitable interpretation upon it, ensured that people had a greater chance of getting their postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> in before the time limit had expired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is enough of this happening- that is to say people being unable to lodge valid votes, to demonstrate the need for amendment to the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument put on absentee votes is invalid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument that there is enough time to apply for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> and always to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> no matter where a person is living is also invalid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the poorest methods of campaigning that all political parties in Australia have now thrust upon themselves is that of going around hospitals, old folks homes and nursing homes to try to squeeze out of the electorate the very last <span class="highlight">vote</span> that may be available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not go to hospitals with 400, 500 or 600 beds because we are interested in getting all the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is necessary to go around a hospital harassing the staff and the patients to ensure that we squeeze out the very last <span class="highlight">vote</span> available in those electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, if there is a matron at a hospital, an old folks home or a nursing home whose political persuasion may be one way or another, she can give direct assistance to that political party by getting it there first, by seeing that the patients fill out the applications for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>, by seeing that the party she favours is present when the postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> form arrives or by making sure that the patient hangs on to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second thing I want to refer to is the suggestion that has been put forward and insisted upon by the Opposition in relation to having a register of general postal voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To consider that we ought to isolate away a register of people who will accept that they will have a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> at each election seems to me to be building into our electoral system the suggestion that we can perhaps have separate rolls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed to start off with a register for those who may want a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> but the process may continue so that we have registers of specific people or classifications of people throughout the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no view put forward here that would persuade anybody to believe that there are large numbers of people being denied a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, I cannot recall on any occasion in this House during the debates that have taken place on all the electoral Bills an honourable member’s saying on behalf of even one person that that person had been denied a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The system as it operates now gives people plenty of time in which to apply for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> and to receive it if they should want to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know, but perhaps he has had some experience in filling out postal voting forms well before the writs have been issued because he may know who applied for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> at previous elections in his electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should reject the idea that in any circumstance we should classify one group of people, whether they be postal voters, Catholics, Methodists, black people, white people or whatever they be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should never start a system of building into the electoral laws of Australia registers of specific voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am the first to admit that the nature of my electorate forces me to keep in my office a register of those who voted by postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the previous Federal election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my view that permanent invalids and very aged persons should be given the option of having their names placed on a roll so that when a Federal election, whether it be a Senate or a House of Representatives election, is held, it is the duty of the various returning officers to forward to those persons a form that is almost completed, reminding the persons of their obligations and of their right to have a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is we who decree that it is compulsory to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am one who believes in compulsory voting but whilst I believe in that I believe also that the Government, whether it be Liberal or Labor, has an obligation to our sick and aged people to make it as easy as possible for them to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My scrutineers noticed at the last election that the postal votes which were cast early, the ones that were organised in hospitals, for example, showed a much greater support for the Liberal Party than would be the case in any subdivision in the whole electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Liberal Party or people paid by them had gone around the hospitals and organised the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I fail to believe that these votes would be any different in normal circumstances from the votes that would apply in the rest of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my strong belief that many people lodging a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> are coerced into voting a certain way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These ballot papers are presented to the various electoral offices as the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the individual in hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It made it difficult for us to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 4 deals with objection to names on the roll, clause 15 deals with various articles by editors and proprietors of newspapers, and clause 1 1 deals with the questions to be put to the voter when he is receiving his ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also gives prisoners sentenced to less than one year’s imprisonment the right to apply for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister proposes to do 2 things in respect of postal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I talked about postal votes and particularly the needs of people in the remote regions a little earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister proposes to restrict the time within which postal votes may be received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, he is going to disfranchise a certain number of people who for one reason or another, sometimes because they live a long way from a postal polling place, will not be able to lodge their <span class="highlight">vote</span> by a certain time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is going to restrict a certain number of them, and their votes are going to be invalid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the direct consequence of what is being done here, and I believe it is being done deliberately because the Government has come to the conclusion that by and large those postal votes that come in late do not favour it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Therefore the more the Government can cut down these votes the better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was pleased to hear agreement from the honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron)  because I know that he among many members here is very knowledgeable in the field of postal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice from looking at election results that he seems to find at the time these votes are counted that he is very popular with the majority of people who <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one of the reasons why we will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, clause 5 deals with postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> applications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far more serious than that is clause 10 which provides that postal votes need to be received by the divisional returning officer by the close of the poll; that is to say, 8 p.m. on polling day or, as the Government would like, 6 p.m. We oppose that change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That will have the effect of making invalid a significant number of postal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present situation is that we have up to 10 days after polling day to get postal votes in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government does not want that; it wants to eliminate the effectiveness of as many postal votes as it can. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course not a lot of election results depend on postal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When they do, surely to heaven the aim should be to provide as great an opportunity as possible for electors on a particular roll to express their view and to cast their votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a large restriction and would cut out 10 days for those who have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> through the mail to have their votes recorded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> must be received by that time and not simply postmarked before that time or anything of that kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, there is the earlier closing off of applications but, secondly and more importantly, there is the earlier time by which votes have to be received before they can be counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many votes are now received after polling day and 3 weeks, which is the time between nomination day and polling day, is not very long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So no applications for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> can be answered before that date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Considering that it is compulsory to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and that many people in the community are not following political affairs as closely as we in this House do, it can take those people a little while to realise that they are in a period in which they must act reasonably quickly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course if those people cannot get an application form it costs them a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the laws have the right to make available to people as great a facility as possible to lodge a <span class="highlight">vote</span> through the mail if they conform to the conditions of the application. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that is just an argument that is brought forward because it is so hard to make arguments other than the real one, which is the desire to cut down the number of valid votes which are being cast through the post. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 7 amends section 89 of the Act to provide that a person is not entitled to inspect applications under subsection (3) for the purpose of compiling lists of names of the persons who made postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> applications except where such a list is genuinely required for the purpose of an inquiry into an alleged breach of the Act or a petition under Part XVIII of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why would it matter if an individual’s application for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> were available for a few days for anybody to read? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a potential political candidate reads it and approaches that person to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a subsequent election I do not see that that matters very much, because questions of harassment and other breaches of law involved are another matter and are covered by other legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they do not so regard it they can simply brush it off, and if they have made up their minds how they are going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> it is their concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of the amendment would be that a postal voter would no longer be able to post or deliver his postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> to a divisional returning officer other than the divisional returning officer for the division in respect of which he is enrolled or to an assistant returning officer or to any presiding officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clause would mean that postal votes would have be be delivered or posted direct to the relevant divisional returning officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our primary interest must be that a large degree of convenience is afforded to the public and that the result is the proper interpretation of the valid votes that are cast by people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So, we oppose the provision and say that it is one of those relatively minor matters which would create more irritation and more difficulties for the elector who is compulsorily required to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and for the elector who wants to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and who wants to <span class="highlight">vote</span> validly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a hypocritical exercise to talk about people voting when the Opposition supports a method of voting that ensures that a large percentage of votes, particularly country votes, are rendered informal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is nonsense to talk about the number of electoral booths if, when the people cast their votes, the votes are then rendered informal by a complicated system of numbering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have only to turn to the electorate of Wimmera in Victoria- my friend the honourable member for Wimmera  (Mr King)  is not here at the moment- to find that the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Senate election last year was 12.1 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is just mouthing words to come into the chamber and to try to put across a case for giving people an entitlement to <span class="highlight">vote</span> if something is not done about ensuring that the votes that are cast are formal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time it provides for the closing of applications for postal votes at 6 p.m. on the Thursday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Minister for Administrative Services  (Mr Daly)  said in this chamber a few weeks ago he went into an office in Brisbane and noted several thousand postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> application forms already completed and waiting to be posted out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> applications have to be returned to the divisional returning officer by the close of the poll the Electoral Office is given an opportunity to produce a much quicker result but it also gives equality of opportunity for all voters in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us look not at those people who are not able to go along to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should people who do not wish to go along to <span class="highlight">vote</span> have a longer period to <span class="highlight">vote</span> than people who attend polling booths to <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is reasonable to expect that, once an election is called, everybody within the nation who is entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> has the same opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To give postal voters considerably longer to <span class="highlight">vote</span> than is provided to people who attend polling booths is to me to give an advantage to postal voters who sometimes are people who do not wish to attend polling booths. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I distinguish between those postal voters who do not wish to attend the polling booth and those who are unable to attend the polling booth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To say that people are being deprived of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> by not being able to get postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> applications returned in time is to put forward an argument that does not stand up to examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediately an election is announced an application form for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> can be obtained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposition that the present proposal deprives people of an opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> is a spurious one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section 96 of the Electoral Act deals specifically with scrutiny by a divisional returning officer of postal votes, the return of postal votes and the opening of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>(b) if satisfied that the signature on the certificate is that of the elector who signed the application for the certificate and that the signature purports to be witnessed by an authorised witness, and that the <span class="highlight">vote</span> contained in the envelope was recorded prior to the close of the poll . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no evidence at all on which a divisional returning officer can determine when a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> was cast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> envelope that is eventually returned to him, that is delivered to him, carries a postmark in some cases 2 days or 3 days after the date on which the election was held, there is no way that the divisional returning officer can properly determine when that <span class="highlight">vote</span> was cast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>that the <span class="highlight">vote</span> contained in the envelope was recorded prior to the close of the poll . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Up to some 18 years ago the situation used to be that the divisional returning officer was required to rule as invalid any postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> envelopes that carried a postmark later than the date on which the election was held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Previous governmentsthe Liberal-Country Party governments of the time- changed that requirement to the provision that I have just quoted which says that the divisional returning officer has simply to satisfy himself that the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was cast prior to the close of the poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking to divisional returning officers, one finds that they have differing opinions as to what constitutes evidence that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> was cast prior to the closing of a poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was a scrutineer with respect to votes cast in his electorate at the last 2 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no way in which the date when those votes were cast can be determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that all of those votes were cast prior to 8 p.m. on 18 May 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of those votes were challenged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was clear in a number of cases that the person who had witnessed the postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> application and the envelope was also the person who had signed as the elector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We asked that a number of such postal votes be passed on to the Electoral Officer for further investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at the results in the 1972 election, we find that a similar situation emerges with respect to that abuse, as revealed by a comparison of the percentages of polling booth votes and postal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we have a system that invites abuse, we come to a proposition such as the one put forward earlier by a spokesman for the Opposition that we ought now to make it easier for people who want to utilise the lurks and perks of the postal voting system and reduce expenditure on election campaigns for the Opposition by providing that the taxpayer finance the preparation of a roll showing those people who <span class="highlight">vote</span> by post. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The system does not provide a fair opportunity for voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are dragged along to polling booths or make application for postal votes, worrying about penalties for failing to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and cast their votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the time, honourable members opposite know full well in their own minds that they are wholeheartedly supporting a method of <span class="highlight">vote</span> counting that ensures that the informal rate in votes cast by country electors is almost twice the rate of informal votes lodged by city electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Queensland after every State election the candidates are sent- or they can ask for one- a State roll which has stamped next to the name of every person who received a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> the words ‘Postal <span class="highlight">Vote</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The truth is of course that at the last Senate election the people not only recorded 200 000 more votes for the Australian Labor Party candidates- the Government- than for all other Parties represented in the Senate combined, but elected 29 Labor senators and 29 Opposition senators and 2 Independents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They did so firstly by asking their Premier of New South Wales to replace  Senator Murphy  with other than a Labor senator and secondly by encouraging their national spokesman on madness, Bjelke-Petersen, to appoint a person other than a replacement from the Labor Party to the Senate so that they could carry in the Senate by a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of 29 to 28 that in deed and in fact the Senate will be the government of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The tame, docile members of the Liberal Party- I congratulate them- every time the National Country Party speaks, run like rabbits to their burrows because for some reason or other they are scared stiff of a selection of people who get 10 per cent of the votes and have 20 per cent of the power in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liberals, by conniving, by distorting the ballot papers and by arranging for excess numbers of candidates, with no possible hope of and no interest in being elected, were able to get an increase in the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> thereby gaining a better position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But in order to reach the $235m, which is the amount that the Liberal and National Country Parties have indicated they would cut right across the board and which necessarily involves the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>, it must also include cancellation of existing commitments to capital expenditure which would involve financial penalties and create problems in factories and industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The draftsmen of the Constitution included these provisions because they knew- and this is a matter of historical fact- that the smaller States, that is smaller in population, would not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for Federation unless they have some protection given to them in the Senate and they got it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a House which has representation elected on a different sort of basis, where all States, regardless of size, have the same number of senators, so that in very small States a small number of voters can ensure equal representation with the very large States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It results in a situation in the Upper House in which it cannot be asserted with any truthfulness at all that the senators are representatives of the people of Australia on the basis of a popular constituency <span class="highlight">vote</span>, certainly not in the way in which members of this House are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The intent on the part of the Opposition, however, is, on the one hand, to try to avoid the historical stigma which will go with the blatant rejection of the Appropriation Bills, but no one will be deceived by this fiction, and on the other hand, to hold together waivering Opposition senators who as a matter of firm principle are very unhappy about the proposition that the Appropriation Bills should be rejected by the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are honourable members opposite prepared to throw that principle overboard on the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of one in the Senate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not even an honest <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why do members of the Opposition not acknowledge that they have been wrong, change their attitude, and let there be a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the other place? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is shameful that not one honourable member on the opposite side is prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> with those on this side in that assertion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the 1973-74 financial year for example, $1,250,000 from my Department’s ‘Machinery of Government’ <span class="highlight">vote</span> was expended on an advertising campaign which included advertisements on the workings of Parliament and on community/Government joint responsibilities in areas such as migrant assimilation and pollution of the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the 1974-75 financial year, $392,000 from the ‘Machinery of Government’ <span class="highlight">vote</span> was expended on an advertising campaign which highlighted community response to Government initiatives in the fields of community health, child care and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, if it is a case of quoting newspaper editorials, there is a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of the action I took. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It knows that it is in no position to move confidently for the rejection of the Appropriation Bills in the Senate because a few Liberal senators have indicated that they would not be prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the blockage of the Appropriation Bills, that is, to reject them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The essential principle of the money power is this: It should be wholly within the fully elected Parliament controlled by the people’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> free from the influence of the Crown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second factor is whether an independent and not a Liberal will gain a vacancy in the Australian Capital Territory, that is, whether the Liberal <span class="highlight">vote</span> can be reduced below 33.3 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The result, which will in short term determine the numerical strength of the Senate, must be largely a lottery and cannot be said to be a true test of the voters’ will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liberals called a meeting today at 1.30 simply because they knew that in half an hour they could not get a decision that would force the Opposition to do the right thing- to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the passing of the Appropriation Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition is always sure of a majority of support in the Senate for the simple reason that if they <span class="highlight">vote</span> against him he tosses them out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They struggle across the Senate with a dead man’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> in their pocket, and the Leader of the Opposition supported that attitude today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who sit in Opposition in another place, by using a dead man’s <span class="highlight">vote</span>, are responsible for the supply of money being cut off at a time when Australia needs it as never before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the Opposition members of the Senate: If they really believe in democracy let the Bessells and others stand up and be counted and refuse to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against Supply as they have said they would. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It it well known, of course, that if the Senate were allowed by the Leader of the Opposition to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Budget Bills they would be passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The weekend before last  Senator Bessell  said on  Four Corners  that he would not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Budget Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are being treated to a charade in the Senate where a majority of senators would <span class="highlight">vote</span> to pass the Budget Bills for very good reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At all events, it is surely about time the Leader of the Opposition allowed his followers in the Senate to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate should be allowed to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has he noticed that the Australian Labor Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> was down by 7 per cent and that even the right wing Workers Party polled approximately as many votes as his once great Party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noticed that the Liberal <span class="highlight">vote</span> declined still further than the Labor <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what I was appalled to notice was that the Country Party and Workers Party votes rose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, there is every reason to believe that if the Opposition were to stand up and declare its real wish- that is, to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Appropriation Bills in the Senate- it would not be able to carry its own senators and the Bills would be passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole of this question arises in the context of the unprecedented and reprehensible action of the Senate in deferring a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the people voted in May of last year they expected that the incoming government would present a Budget not only in the latter part of 1 974 but also in the latter part of 1975 and also in the latter part of 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not distraught as those opposite are by the High Court having held what would obviously have been the case in the minds of most honourable gentlemen, that senators may be elected from the Territories and may <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are witnessing this last ditch attempt on the part of the honourable member for Wentworth to have the whole affair referred to yet another committee because the Country Party lives in hope that the matter of land rights for Aborigines, like the matter of electoral reform and one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, can be staved off in the hope of an electoral miracle which will somehow make these issues dead letters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Bessell  said on  Four Corners  the weekend before last that he would not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite plain that when the Leader of the Opposition hauls off the Liberal Premiers who control the selection of Liberal Senate candidates and allows a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> in his Party room there will be a <span class="highlight">vote</span> by the senators on the Budget and the senators will pass the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My advice to him is to spend more time in the House and learn what is going on instead of jet setting around the place, and to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for legislation such as the disclosure of funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are going to have an elected body, but in some ways the idea of one man one <span class="highlight">vote</span> or equal <span class="highlight">vote</span> equal value, if I may use that phrase, is absolutely foreign to the Aboriginal concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The thing which shocked them most- I do not put it as being right or wrongwas that women should have the same kind of <span class="highlight">vote</span> as men, because the idea that the woman and man are equal is absolutely foreign to the Aboriginal concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are going to give each adult Aboriginal a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and he is going to be the same as every other adult Aboriginal’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am referring particularly to clause 12 which refers to the first <span class="highlight">vote</span> which will be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, I would have preferred to have seen explored some way of obtaining an initial Aboriginal consensus without putting the question to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> where everybody is equal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, the honourable gentleman talked about elections, who should <span class="highlight">vote</span> and matters of that kind when he raised the point about our seeking to impose our values. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman talked about our seeking to require both men and women to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and that that could be at variance with Aboriginal practices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that it is in some parts of Australia at least, but he should note that there is no obligation for Aboriginal women to <span class="highlight">vote</span> or for Aboriginal men to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this situation unless they choose to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also want to take him up on the remarks he made about the rigging of votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Strangely enough, in the area about which he was speaking- -Wattie Creek and Hooker Creek about 70 miles south from there- at a previous election a whole block of votes came in all marked with the same pencil and all marked with exactly the same preferences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor supporters have been seen grabbing how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> cards from Aborigines in various areas and abusing people for supporting the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There we have not seen any of the artificial and hypocritical <span class="highlight">vote</span> catching moves that have been stimulated by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is not a bloody <span class="highlight">vote</span> left in the Aboriginals’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly the senators have not yet moved from their stalling of the Budget nor have they yet moved to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Budget- for it or against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, until the Opposition senators make up their minds to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the money Bills in this case the time for setting in train the machinery for resolving deadlocks between the Houses to bring about a double dissolution cannot yet run. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless a government has a majority in the Senate to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of any Bill or motion the Senate can frustrate the Government which, in the nature of things, has to have a majority in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fortnight ago at a Press conference he said that his proposals were now inoperative; that is, we are asked to have an election for the House of Representatives on the basis of a Budget to which the Opposition presents no alternative and for which they are prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can no longer be any doubt that the Opposition’s policy of blocking the Budget, of stalling the Budget and of going on strike in the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the Budget, has been rejected by an overwhelming majority of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Partly because of the nature of this threat, partly because of the nature of this Prime Minister, we, with completely unanimous support, made a reasonable and responsible proposal on Monday which would have enabled the people of Australia to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Its acceptance would preserve the parliamentary institution of which the Senate as well as the House of Representatives is a part and would preserve the right of the people of Australia to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Outside the House and by proxy in the Senatedisgracefully by the stolen proxy of a dead Senator’s <span class="highlight">vote</span>- he has been prepared to say that the conduct of the Government justifies any extreme course, justifies tearing up the Constitution, justifies economic disruption and chaos. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But without daring to allow senators to <span class="highlight">vote</span> the clear rejection or acceptance of the Budget, the Opposition in the Senate claims authority to nullify a Bill which it cannot even amend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  who is about to take part in this debate said it was a ‘ tainted Senate ‘-there is a <span class="highlight">vote</span> being exercised one way that ought properly to be exercised the other way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would be voted out immediately in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But a servile majority of the House of Representatives was prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> to vindicate a military raid on itself which its own  Speaker  and its own  Clerk  did not support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-4-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I found the principle firmly enunciated this morning by the Prime Minister a rather novel one, that there would be a completely free flow of debate in this chamber- except when it was embarrassing and then, of course, the matter would be put to the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-4-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members casting their <span class="highlight">vote</span> ought to remember that kind of service to the parliamentary system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, if we want to do justice to the parliamentary system we should <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the honourable member for Scullin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, this afternoon I hope we will cast our <span class="highlight">vote</span> objectively and <span class="highlight">vote</span> for my friend, the honourable member for Scullin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that Caucus the Labor senators have exactly the same <span class="highlight">vote</span> as the members of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So when he talks of the supremacy of this House and puts himself forward as its defender he is acting a lie, because what happens in his Caucus is that he gives the Labor senators exactly the same <span class="highlight">vote</span> as the members of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What it did was use the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of a man who died to make sure that no <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken upon them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is clear from May’s  Parliamentary Practiceand  the House has always followed this rule- that reflections cannot be cast in debate on the conduct of the Governor-General and certain other persons, unless the discussion is based upon a substantive motion, drawn in proper terms, which admits of a distinct <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For the eighth consecutive time in 1954 and 1961 we had well won the majority of the 2-party preferred <span class="highlight">vote</span> but again because of the electoral system we failed to win office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am merely suggesting, if the honourable member would listen, that on 3 occasions we won the majority of the 2-party preferred <span class="highlight">vote</span> and we still failed to win office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But my confidence was restored by the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To make things worse, those who sit opposite now acknowledge the lack of principle by which the Senate is for the first time conceded the right to determine monetary affairs, including Supply Bills, so a government can be thrown out by the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of a senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now the very fundamental and cardinal principle of one man one <span class="highlight">vote</span> and equal <span class="highlight">vote</span> equal value has been watered down because senators have been given the right to determine whether a government can stay in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Finally and generally, I put it to honourable gentlemen opposite that despite the fact that the National Country Party of Australia has 23 seats in this House- incidentally on the huge national <span class="highlight">vote</span> of 1 1 per cent- they should never forget that we are an incredibly urbanised society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to note that in the 1975 election the National Country Party obtained 37.8 per cent of the votes in the electorates it contested, a 4 per cent increase on the 1972 result, and obtained a grand total of 26.7 per cent of the total votes registered in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It did not say that that <span class="highlight">vote</span> was the end of the matter, and history has provided the answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new Government administers the affairs of this nation with a mandate that comes from 53 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and which gave it nearly 72 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us look at the <span class="highlight">vote</span> the Labor Party attracted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I compare that with the position of the National Country Party which, with less than 10 per cent of the votes cast, has 23 seats in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I repeat those figures: The Labor Party with 42.8 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> holds 36 seats in this House; the Liberal Party with approximately 42 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> has 68 seats in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I could not altogether agree with him when he said that  Mr Daly  was deliberately endeavouring to ensure that democracy was working to the full, that every man and woman was entitled to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and all these sorts of things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I just remind the honourable member that one of the very last actions carried out by  Mr Daly  as Minister for Services and Property in this chamber was to close down some 900 polling booths, which made it very difficult for many constituents throughout Australia to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not want to be definitive in relation to a particular amendment that is not yet before the House, but in general terms I have expressed the view that a Bill that was passed through this chamber on a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> ought to be amended on a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us go back to the New South Wales election in 1973, to those halcyon days when it was believed by the Labor Party that the honourable member for Werriwa  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  was a <span class="highlight">vote</span> winner, when it was believed by the Labor Party throughout Australia, whether one was a Federal member of Parliament or a State member of Parliament, that the way to success, the way to the voter’s heart was to associate yourself with the Leader of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party- the then Prime Minister of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It strikes me that when we are looking at ways of saving money, or conversely of increasing the proportion of the welfare <span class="highlight">vote</span> that actually goes to pensioners or to others in receipt of welfare, surely we should be examining how to make certain that these inefficient benefits can be replaced by efficient ones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The subsidy is distributed among parties according to the number of votes polled, and is distributed at the rate of 10 per cent in the first year after the election, IS per cent in the second year, 35 per cent in the third year and the remaining 40 per cent immediately after the general elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the benefit of new honourable members, 1 mention that these principles were debated at great length in both Houses of the last Parliament, and the Bill was extensively amended before being finally approved by a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> of members on all sides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost 14 per cent of the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> went to training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will insist that local government bodies approach the Federal Government, if at all, through the States, through a level at which they have no <span class="highlight">vote</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet every government party supporter in this chamber will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this Bill knowing, as I have pointed out, that in fact clause 8 of the Bill does no such thing; that it leaves it up to regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought not to be in any doubt when we <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage I should like to incorporate a Morgan Gallup Poll table published in this week’s  Bulletin  which shows that politically the Government has to be careful even though it has another 2 years to run in office because the position now is that the Liberal Party and the National Country Party have 47 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and we have 46 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  a short while ago quoted to honourable members the latest gallup poll figures from the  Bulletin  which show that the Liberal-National Country Party coalition had 47 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and that the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These figures show a dramatic increase in Labor’s share of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in such a short time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A meeting of representatives of the various health funds was held in Sydney yesterday and  Mr J.  F. Cade of the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia told the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  that he was going to get some Government senators to cross the floor to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Medibank proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was a heavy charge on the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is stressed in our decision to adopt a common aim for all 3 organisations, which has been formulated bearing in mind the fact that the organisations will be funded from the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and that the public submissions received strongly favoured the maintenance of a military flavour in cadet activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will let every one of the 3 ‘A million television viewers know that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Labor Party at the next election will mean $40 or $70 extra in their pockets each year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the present council of the Medical Benefits Fund decides which doctors should be entitled to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the next election for the council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important thing is that the only people who can nominate for election and the only people who can <span class="highlight">vote</span> are those medical contributors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want you to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on these, but as soon as the election is over at midnight on 13 December, forget about it, because then you have a different ball game. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The then Federal Opposition and its conservative State partners urged a ‘No’ <span class="highlight">vote</span> to that referendum question- the then Federal Opposition for narrowminded political purposes and the States to keep local government effectively under their thumbs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course absentee voting is by postal ballot so the legislation currently requires all unions which hold secret ballots by the use of polling booths also to make provision for secret postal voting for those who want to <span class="highlight">vote</span> absentee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations claimed that a benefit of this would be a higher election participation rate because every member eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span> would receive a ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would therefore have been possible, it seemed to us, for unions to conduct elections simply by running a postal ballot in which all who wanted to <span class="highlight">vote</span> would apply to the returning officer for a form in much the same way as absentee voting is conducted under the current Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would certainly not have required that a ballot paper be sent to all members eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>will afford to members entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> an adequate opportunity of voting without intimidation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, for example, a union has most of its workers employed in three or four sites in the country and they are not spread through many small factories, in that case it could be quite appropriate for the ballot to be conducted by way of polling booths at those three or four limited sites where 90 per cent or 95 per cent of the union membership might be found, and for there to be a supplementary provision whereby people could apply for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span> if they so wished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if you consider the situation faced by the rank and file union membership of a large national union where every member of the union throughout the country is required, or is given the opportunity, to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, for example, for the national  president  or the secretary of the union, you can see the potential problem that the average unionist faces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can a candidate, representing a moderate group within the union- a group that perhaps does not have great organisational or financial resources behind it- conduct a campaign which would require him to organise support throughout the factories and to send through the post how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> information and literature on himself and his policies to every union member throughout the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be more likely that the average rank and file unionist would want to offer himself for election, and where it would be possible for him to become known and for members of the union to express a meaningful <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The electors throughout the country do not directly <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At end of paragraph (a) omit ‘and’ and insert the following paragraph: (aa) by inserting in sub-section ( 1 ), after the definition of “Organization”, the following definition:  “Postal ballot” means a ballot for the purposes of which a ballot paper is to be sent by prepaid post to each person entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and facilities are to be provided for the return of the completed ballot paper by post by the voter without expense to him; ‘; ana’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All honourable members will recall that during the last election campaign the Government said time and time again that it proposed to legislate, upon regaining the Government benches, to provide that all union members would have a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>, or the ability to have a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>, in union elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary section 133(1) (a) provides that the rules of the association or organisation shall provide for the election of the holder of each office within the association or organisation at an election at which all financial members are eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has to be a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of all members eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill says that for the election of officeholders the rules must provide that all financial members are eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and that the <span class="highlight">vote</span> shall be by secret postal ballot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Bill reads without the amendment put up by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, a union could have rules which provide that members may simply write to the returning officer, requesting a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would be a secret postal ballot but it would not mean that all the members eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span> would receive a ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is ironic that the Government which now sits on the Treasury benches was elected to government because it told the Australian people, and in particular the 5 250 000 employees in the work force: ‘If you <span class="highlight">vote</span> for us we will hand control of the unions back to the members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that he is well aware of what sort of postal ballot it is but it might be appropriate to explain that the postal ballot to which the honourable member was referring is in fact an absent <span class="highlight">vote</span> for which a member can make application to <span class="highlight">vote</span> postal, which is very different from the proposition we are putting forward in this legislation because, firstly, the member bears the cost himself, and secondly, he has to apply for the ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He himself is a party to an act which we can prove is the supporting of a corrupt ballot, that is, when he sits in the Liberal and Country Party rooms and puts up his hand in favour of a 20 per cent discrepancy between the value of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the metropolitan area and the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a rural area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-When Government members talk about every union member having a <span class="highlight">vote</span>, the position is quite ridiculous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are literally tens of thousands of members of the State union in Queensland who are now participating in Federal union elections and who have no right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The report, like its 2 predecessors, is unanimous, but the Australian Labor Party will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the decision to repeal the Act which set up the Road Safety and Standards Authority which was to be establised at Albury-Wodonga. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that on this non-political issue honourable members will exercise their discretion and <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has his attention been drawn to the statement by the honourable member for Farrer on 8 April 1959  (Hansard,  page 999) that the Menzies Government sent the Minister for Civil Aviation to New Zealand and put the utmost pressure on the New Zealand Government and the Board of Tasman Empire Airways Ltd to rescind their <span class="highlight">vote</span> to buy Comets and to purchase Electras instead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-52-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that telegram, the Attorney-General, a man who ought to be pretty careful about saying what he means, told Aboriginal people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> Liberal-National Country Party on 13 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to know that in areas where the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">vote</span> can be identified I win that <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would need to be persuaded fairly strongly before I would <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a permanent change to Standing Orders in any further extension to the 1 1 o ‘clock adjournment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it is clear that if this were a proposition upon which a <span class="highlight">vote</span> could be taken it would be carried without dissent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During my term as Prime Minister the then Leader of the House enabled a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be taken on every General Business proposition that anybody moved, and I think they were all moved by members of the then Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that the actual <span class="highlight">vote</span> being carried in the affirmative means that the time remains at 1 o’clock and is not amended to 3 o’clock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Opposition, to extend the time to 3 o’clock, would <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the House votes that the time proposed to be omitted stand, that means that that time of 1 o’clock stands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To have its amendment carried the Opposition therefore would <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the question so that the time of 1 o’clock would not stand and would be amended to 3 o’clock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least a <span class="highlight">vote</span> should be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He may support it; he may oppose it, but at least we should have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every motion of private members’ business which was proposed in this House during the period of the Australian Labor Party Government was brought to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition expressed at the outset the view that it regards this matter as being one that will be subject to a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 mention again that the Opposition has a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had indicated that the Opposition regards this matter as one on which its members may exercise a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, as I understand the situation, members of the Liberal Party and the National Country Party will <span class="highlight">vote</span> on Party lines on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliament in which members of the Liberal Party and the National Country Party have been given a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe and I hope that some honourable members on the Government side will see fit to <span class="highlight">vote</span> independently and in accordance with the wishes of the majority of the electors they represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Look, my friend, you asked me what happens to the free <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we in the Liberal Party are allowed to exercise a free <span class="highlight">vote</span> this is one of those measures on which we stand as one in supporting the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he had listened to his  Deputy  Whip he would have heard him acknowledge in his speech S minutes ago that it was not a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In looking for a reason I have to say that during previous debates when free votes were taken the track record of the Attorney-General was not terribly good in respect of voting on the side that won the division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me make it quite clear to those who sit behind me that they may <span class="highlight">vote</span> according to their conscience on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe in the right of the rank and file to have a direct <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the election of their executive officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a measure of the hypocrisy of the opponents of labour who have so much to say about rank and file control that they are the ones who are now advocating the collegiate system for union elections which will deny to the rank and file a direct <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the election of their full time officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead, a <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken on a motion calling for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of confidence in the Trades Hall Council and for a request to stop work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as I am concerned, the most important aspect of this provision is that it removes the pensioner recipient from the political arena and no longer will political parties of any persuasion be able to offer an increase in pension as a means of attracting the pensioner’s <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the policy statement made prior to the time when the people had to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on 13 December there was no equivocation in what the Prime Minister said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole philosophy and tenor of the honourable member’s speech was based on the simple proposition that this Bill is unsatisfactorythe Opposition dares not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it, of course- because it does not propose to increase public expenditure quickly enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This development in industry will mean that as time goes on fewer and fewer job opportunities will occur in secondary industry, and society therefore has to decide whether we will maintain a very high rate of unemployment with consequent heavy expenditure by Government on unemployment relief with its associated social problems; whether we will introduce unemployment relief schemes to provide job opportunities and social and cultural improvements such as playing fields; whether government increases the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of funds for public investment to provide also improved public facilities such as hospitals, road building, sewerage and schools; or whether working hours are to be cut and annual and long service leave are to be increased so as to allow for a great many more people to be employed in industry than are at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Treasurer has stated in his Budget Speech that when the people of Australia voted at the election held on 13 December 1975 the national economy was suffering from inflation, stagnation and unemployment, that Australia was locked into its most serious postwar recession, and that at that time there were people who were pondering whether we were facing historical developments that would be seen to be similar to the fearful economic circumstances of the 1930s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There had been occasions during that period when the leaders of the Labor Party had made the most tremendous offers to the Australian voters in the hope of gaining their support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the manner in which the words were uttered there was some sort of an association with people having the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and the reasons for making those utterances which will not escape the attention of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the overwhelming <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Australian people and the electoral massacre of the Labor Party, the Leader of the Opposition has displayed unparalleled effrontery, stubbornness and incredible arrogance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was said, no doubt with some honestly, by the Treasurer that he thought the education <span class="highlight">vote</span> was a 2 per cent increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In keeping with the whole Government approach- restraint in all areas- this Budget has shown that, whereas the Labor Government may have made some mistakes in attempting to stimulate development in areas which have been stultified for 20 years, the only positive actionthis is a rather Irish approach, I guess- the present Government has taken has been to stifle every initiative the Labor Government put forward, every initiative the Australian community voted for, and every initiative we talked about in the period from about 1968 onwards until we were elected which clearly excited the Australian community and prompted people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They had been defeated in the House of Representatives and then they used their brutal majority in the Senate to defeat the legislation providing for one man one <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the 1975 House of Representatives election the Liberal Party won 3 248 000 votes, or 42 per cent of the total. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking the total number of votes for the Australian Labor Party and dividing it by the votes per seat for the Liberal Party, the Australian Labor Party today would hold 68 seats in the House- not 36 seats, as it does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would be the position if the same number of votes were required to elect a Labor man as are required to elect a Liberal man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, if one takes the National Country Party situation I can well understand why the honourable member for Hume wants to try to sit me down- one finds this incredible position: Dividing the total ALP <span class="highlight">vote</span> by the number of votes required to elect a National Country Party candidate, Labor would have not 36 members but 89 members in the House at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a system, of course, makes a mockery of the one man one <span class="highlight">vote</span> principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In essence, this is what the figures mean: Labor, which polled more votes than any other party, gained 3 314 000 votes, or 42.8 per cent of the total. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For each of the 36 seats that it won, it had to get 92 027 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party with fewer overall votes- that is, with 3 248 136 votes or 42 per cent of the total- had to get only 47 766 votes per seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor had to get 92 027 votes to win a seat and the Liberal Party had to get 47 766 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very early in his address he made some reference  to the principle  of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then he went on to talk about how the Liberal Party got so many votes, and how it got a bigger proportion of the seats than it was entitled to as compared with the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party got every possible <span class="highlight">vote</span> by contesting every seat in Australia, whereas the Liberal Party and the National Country Party contested only a limited number of seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt if the National Country Party had contested as many seats as did the Labor Party it only stands to reason that its <span class="highlight">vote</span>- I think he said 800 000 votes- would naturally be increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently in adding up the figures, the honourable member for Hughes should add together the votes polled by the National Country Party and the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one talks of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value that exercise has the result of sounding good, but what does the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value really mean? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He decided to close any polling booth at which fewer than 100 people voted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You say: ‘Oh well, the Minister at the time,  Mr Daly,  suggested that they cast a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That shows how knowledgeable the then Minister was, because the simple fact is that Oodnadatta was located in such a situation that it was impossible for a constituent in the electorate of the honourable member for Wakefield to cast his <span class="highlight">vote</span> before polling day, because once nominations had closed all of those individuals living in and around Oodnadatta would have to make an application for a postal <span class="highlight">vote</span>, send it off to the Returning officer, get the postal voting form back, and then return that to the Electoral Officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is based on one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Before the juniors of the Liberal Party get too excited about what I have to say, I point out that on all occasions throughout all the years when we were being charged with trying to bring in a system which would favour Labor, that is one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, the people in the country, in onslaughts against the Labor Party, were led to believe that in some way country people would be deprived of their right to electoral representation and to have their influence felt in the Parliament of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the commissioners, who no longer are responsible to the Parliament but whose decisions can be appealed against only in the courts, brought in their report some weeks ago based on one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, they wiped out 5 country seats and they made one country electorate almost two-thirds of the size of the State; but the Liberal Party did not appeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those colleagues know that when they have the majority of votes in South Australia in the future they will be the government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of all the fears which over the years were driven into country people, we now find that the House of Assembly is to be elected on the basis of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is in spite of the charge or allegation that it will take 54 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> to have the Liberal Country League elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Port Adelaide put forward the view that one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value means equal numbers of voters in each electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value means is that government should change hands when one party achieves 50 per cent or more of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on a 2-party preferred <span class="highlight">vote</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the essential criterion for determining one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The party with 50 per cent or more of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on a two party preferred <span class="highlight">vote</span> basis should be the government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the State election last year the Labor Party gained office with less than 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> while the Liberal Party had more than 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under this new redistribution the Liberal Party will have to attain 54 per cent of the votes to obtain office in South Australia at the next State election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless you take account of the demographic structure of Adelaide, particularly the Adelaide suburbs and the distribution of voting patterns, you cannot have a one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value voting system in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that the Liberal Party needs 54 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>, it will attain 54 per cent at the next election and will throw the Labor Party out of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we have a situation of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, as in South Australia, I very much doubt that that could be called a gerrymander. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Well, on 13 December last the public gave this Government a resounding <span class="highlight">vote</span> of confidence and asked it to reduce the rate of inflation because it knows that if inflation is allowed to continue at the level established by the former Labor administration it can only be destructive not only of the economy but of the very social fabric of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The government of the day was so afraid of his <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and that was the only other right he could have got, that it gave him  ex gratia  pension but still would not allow him to become naturalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in passing, as it is a related subject, I wish to remark upon the extraordinary attitude still being maintained by the honourable gentlemen opposite who still take the view that the Federal Government has a right to try to buy votes by buying into areas with taxpayers’ money that quite properly should reside with the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result, the specific <span class="highlight">vote</span> buying gimmicks introduced by honourable members opposite to try to con their way into power have been done away with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government will win its votes by its efforts and it will not buy them with the taxpayers’ money the way the Labor Government did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government, which told the people of Australia prior to 13 December that it had the panacea to all of these ills and encouraged them to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it, has done nothing in the period of almost 12 months it has been in office to improve the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We recall that on 13 December last year the Australian Labour Party got the most overwhelming <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence that any political party has received in Australia’s history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In October 1973 I met the Premiers and put to them a proposition I had put in my Party’s election campaign a year before- that aldermen and councillors from each State should choose a representative to speak and <span class="highlight">vote</span> on their behalf at the Loan Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet at the Melbourne meeting of the Constitutional Convention a year ago when the proposition came up for a <span class="highlight">vote</span> that the Constitution should be amended by holding a referendum to provide for the borrowing of money by the Com-  monwealth for local government bodies constituted under the law of a State or Territory, there again State Liberals who attended- the 8 from South Australia and Tasmania and the Liberal Movement representative from South Australiaall voted against the proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That would be consistent with the centralist ideas of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition that the States, as his leader has said, should disappear and that State parliaments should <span class="highlight">vote</span> themselves out of existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What has happened is that the percentage of the Council’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> going to administration doubled between the last Liberal Budget in 1972-73 and the last Labor Budget in 1 975-76 from 8.4 per cent in the first year to 1 6.7 per cent in the second year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No matter where one looks, it is obvious that the Country Party believes it has the rural <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the bag, and I think that in some respects the same thing can be said of the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1973, the then Minister for Labour, the honourable Clyde Cameron, introduced amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which had the effect of requiring the election of the holder of each office in an organisation by direct <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the appropriate section of the membership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An exception from this requirement was permitted in relation to those offices of a part-time nature on an organisation’s federal committee of management where the rules of the organisation provided, before the commencement of the amendment, a form of election other than by direct <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Alternatively, the organisation may choose a one-tier collegiate system; that is, a system whereby a conference or council is elected by direct <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the appropriate section of the rank and file membership and that conference or council elects from its members the fulltime officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In relation to offices, the duties of which are not full time in nature, the position whereby organisations may adopt a direct election, onetier or a multiple-tier system of collegiate election, for example, a system whereby the conference or council which is elected by direct <span class="highlight">vote</span> may elect from its members another body which then elects from its members the part-time officers, will be restored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What are the names of employee organisations registered under the  Conciliation and Arbitration Act  1904-1976 whose registered rules (a) permit the election of full-time executive officers by the ‘collegiate’ system of voting, (b) require that the election of full-time executive officers shall be by direct <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the rank and file of the organisation and (c) were altered since 1 973 to comply with the requirements of section 133 of the Act <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-48-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new clause, recognising the overwhelming <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the 1967 referendum to give the Parliament legislative power in Aboriginal affairs, wil reinstate that provision in the 1975 Bill which makes any such declaration subject to disallowance by either House of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We speak here of the most overwhelming <span class="highlight">vote</span> that any proposition in Australia has ever received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Possibly the watershed of that concern was the 1967 referendum which was carried throughout Australia by an exceptionally large <span class="highlight">vote</span> and which the honourable member for Wills mentioned earlier- a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in excess of 90 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the second reading of the National Companies Bill not because all the objectives of the legislation are not the objectives which the Government might share, not because there is not a very compelling need in this country for a greater level of uniformity and not because I am in total disagreement with a number of the arguments which have been advanced by both the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  and the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Antony Whitiam). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason the Government will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the second reading is that at this stage the approach which is fundamental to the introduction of this Bill is not in conformity with the policy option which the Government is currently pursuing in negotiation with the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will therefore be the intention of the Government to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the second reading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are 300 000 conservationists in Australia so a lot of politicians shimmy and shake when they think of the conservationists’ <span class="highlight">vote</span>, but what they do not understand is that about 75 per cent of those 300 000 would not touch this lunatic fringe, would not come into contact with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was then, however, linked with a proposal that section 128 of the Constitution should be amended to allow changes to the Constitution if a majority of voters in only 3 States agreed to the alteration instead of a majority of voters in a majority of States, as the Constitution now provides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The indications from the Hobart meeting of the Australian Constitutional Convention are that the proposal that Territory electors should be given a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referendums has overwhelming support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether the people realise that if they want to protect the Housing Commission system and if low income earners are to be given the opportunity of obtaining housing- this group includes many young couples who have not had the opportunity to assemble the deposit- they will have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a Labor Government in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that every member in each House of any principle, every member who has regard for the safety of our institutions, will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Bill and outside will give it his support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fourth Bill proposes to give electors in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in future referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that we should have this referendum put to the people- at this stage it can only be put to the electors of the States- and let the electors of the States say that when there is a referendum the electors in the Territories also should be able to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on those referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speculated that  Sir John  Nimmo as Royal Commissioner on Norfolk Island might recommend that the Australian citizens of Norfolk Island should be given a <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also vouchsafed the opinion that in respect of Cocos Island and Christmas Island there are powerful international arguments for giving votes for the House of Representatives to the citizens who reside there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill, if carried by electors of the States, will permit the Australian citizens in those overseas Territories-I imagine honourable members and honourable senators and the great majority of Australian citizens everywhere, including in those Territories, would wish them to remain Territories of this country-to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in any future referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing wrong in their being asked to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second question which I think is equally likely to be accepted without criticism, although I know that there were some people at the Constitutional Convention in Hobart who offered some views upon it, is the question of altering the Constitution so as to allow electors in Territories as well as electors in the States to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums on proposed laws to alter the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it important that in looking at the package as it was then submitted- the precipitate way in which it emerged before consideration by the Convention, without the ratification or the backing of the Convention- we realise the questions were put as matters which it was felt by us and, I suspect, by many Australians, for the <span class="highlight">vote</span> indicated that that was so, were designed to change the Constitution to the advantage of the then Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Constitutional change is not something on which we should embark lightly, but when it has been ratified by successive Conventions and there has been an almost unanimous acceptance of those resolutions it is necessary that the Australian people have the chance to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and endorse that decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the Bills under discussion proposes to give the people in the Territories of Australia a <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have been denied a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when it comes to a suggestion that the people in the Territories should be permitted to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on constitutional changes they are denied that right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a tragedy that at the Hobart convention the first item to be discussed was whether there should be a referendum <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the people in the Territories and the representatives from the Queensland government said ‘no’ and stood up and voted against the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To deny fellow Australians a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is only divisive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members care to read what was put out when we were suggesting on a previous occasion that the people in the Territories be permitted to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums they will see that it was said: ‘That is a very dangerous thing to do’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what was said when we were talking about giving a referendum <span class="highlight">vote</span> to the people in the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it any wonder that people reading that and thinking that it had some legal basis might well be encouraged to <span class="highlight">vote</span> no? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is some slight hope that in the next referendum they will change their view but I am very doubtful about this because of what I saw in October last when they were so vicious in their opposition to the move to give a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to the people in the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we consider the case for voting ‘No’ to simultaneous elections I hope we do not have the sheer nonsense and rubbish that was circulated last time as to why people should <span class="highlight">vote</span> against simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What utter nonsense to say in the first instance that senators should be elected by the people and then to suggest that people will be misled about whom they <span class="highlight">vote</span> for on that basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I believe that the referendum proposals will at long last bring democracy into constitutional reform by giving the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> to over 300 000 Australians who happen to live in the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They found that, when vacancies occurred, instead of their votes still counting, they were then represented by persons for whom they would never have voted and who indeed were not even candidates at the elections at which their original choice received their number one <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First and foremost is the proposition to amend the Constitution to give the electors of the Territories of Australia a right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have the greatest trouble in digesting the troglodyte arguments of those who contend that for some reason persons who live in the Australian Capital Territory and in the Northern Territory or, indeed, on Norfolk Island should not be given the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums when they are given the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the extraordinary situation of the residents of Lord Howe Island, being classified as residents of New South Wales-I think I am correct in saying that Lord Howe Island is part of the electorate of Sydney-having the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referenda and at Federal elections but their colleagues who live 400 miles, or whatever it is, to the north-east of them on Norfolk Island are denied the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referenda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Northern Territorians have been asking for the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums since as long ago as 1965 when they did not even have a fully elected Legislative Council, as it then was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you can get Tiger Brennan, Ren DeGaris, Jim Killen and all those other people agreeing, as in fact they did by unanimous resolution- we recommended that the Constitution be altered to provide that residents of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory should be granted the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums, and we went on to draw attention to the situation with respect to residents of Norfolk Island- I suggest it should indicate to all fair thinking men, regardless of their political background, the weight and merit of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a pity that perhaps the proposal does not go quite so far as it could; for example, by employing the Hare-Clark system as it applies in Tasmania so that the votes could have been counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By and large I believe and hope that the people of Australia will accept this referendum proposal because it gives effect to the democratically cast <span class="highlight">vote</span> of an elector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later in the same year when it became clear that the Queensland Legislative Assembly intended to <span class="highlight">vote</span> to fill the vacancy created by the death of  Senator Milliner  by choosing a candidate who did not have the support of the late  Senator Milliner’s  party, the Government moved in the House of Representatives that the House commend to the Parliaments of all the States the practice which had prevailed since 1949 and that the House express its great concern over reports that the long-established convention may not be followed by the Queensland House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This left those New South Wales voters who had supported the Australian Labor Party on 15 May 1974 under-represented in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new senator supported the Government on some vital issues, such as the passage of Supply, but he voted against the Government on other important issues such as the redistribution for which given the results of the double dissolution election of 18 May 1974 the Government had a clear mandate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That distortion allowed the Senate to <span class="highlight">vote</span> to defer Supply- a <span class="highlight">vote</span> which could not have been passed if the late  Senator Milliner  had been replaced by a Labor Party senator- and to bring on the instability and crisis in November and December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A political party may choose to nominate as a candidate for appointment to the Senate someone whom it would not be prepared to put on its party ticket at an election because that party might know that the person whom they were nominating would not have public appeal and might in fact lose it votes if he had to face an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unquestioned that many people in Victoria, normal moderate Labor voters, avoided his name on the Labor Party ticket when they were casting their <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say on behalf of the residents of the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne that another Bill before the House which proposes to enable the residents of Federal Territories to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referendums is a most desirable one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would think that most people in Australia would recognise that residents of the Territories are citizens of Australia and that they should not be excluded by some narrow legal definition from exercising their rights to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in national referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the vast majority of people hold the view that they should be able to cast their <span class="highlight">vote</span> for both Houses at the one time and not be required to go along for a second time to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for half of the Senate only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had this group been able to <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the other undisputed delegates to determine which of the two disputed delegations from Victoria were to be allowed to take their seats then there is still no doubt that the Gair group would have had the numbers to decide in favour of the Victorian group led by McManus and they would have had 22 delegates to our 14. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to the matter of people in the Territories having the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us imagine that 4 States each decided by a very narrow majority in favour of a change and that the ‘yes’ <span class="highlight">vote</span> majority throughout the 6 States has only a few hundred- a few thousand if you like- an equal number to that margin plus one would be enough for the voters in the Australian Capital Territory to set aside the majority decision in a majority of States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot really understand those objections that are put every now and again, that persons in the Territories should not have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for or against certain proposals at a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us who have participated in elections are also aware that in a Senate election people generally, say: Why the hell do we have to go out and <span class="highlight">vote</span> on Saturday? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In almost all cases very few political leaders have shown any enthusiasm for single Senate elections at which people have been asked to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for senators and which do not involve the election of a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result has been- the recent Senate election indicates this quite clearly- that people tend to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for those people who put forward a point of view which is attractive but which would not attract their votes if the choice of a government depended on their decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Victoria a candidate received 20 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> but his Party in a general election was able to achieve only between 9 per cent and 12 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also applies to the people of the Northern Territory who have never had the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a referendum for the Territorial citizens is of direct concern only to those people living in the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have heard it suggested that people in the more geographically remote or isolated States in Australia, such as Western Australia or Queensland, may be tempted to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against this proposal simply as a means of registering some sort of political protest against the centralisation of power in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably the most ironical aspect of the denial of the right of a referendum <span class="highlight">vote</span> to citizens of the Territories is that many of the descendants of the original citizens of this country, the Aborigines, reside in those Territories and these people are being denied a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referenda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appeal to all voting Australians to support this move to see that their fellow citizens in the Territories are given the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referenda so that they can exercise the same democratic rights as all other voting citizens and express their points of view of issues which concern them as much as they concern other citizens of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of the fourth Bill is to alter the Constitution to allow electors in Territories as well as electors in the States to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums on proposed laws to alter the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An Act to facilitate alterations to the Constitution and to allow electors in Territories, as well as electors in the States,  to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums on proposed laws to alter the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in every other State in Australia- Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania- there was a ‘no’ <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people voted against the proposition on that occasion and I do not really believe that people change their views that quickly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Much to my amazement, astonishment and fear, I heard the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  this afternoon talk about people of the Cocos Islands, Christmas Island and Norfolk Island, as Territories of Australia, being given the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referendums in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were able to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the election of the then 6 South Australian senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following troubles during the latter part of the First World War and during the rest of that decade, a royal commission which severely criticised Commonwealth administration of the Territory caused the Commonwealth Act of 1923 which granted the Territory a representative in the House of Representatives, who was allowed to take part in all debates but who could not <span class="highlight">vote</span> except on a motion for the disallowance of any ordinance of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind honourable members that on 18 May 1974 New South Wales was the only State that was prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> ‘yes’ in favour of allowing the votes of the people of the Australian Capital Territory to be counted when determining whether a referendum had been passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1974 every proposal received a large ‘no’ <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These proposals for constitutional change are contained within 4 Bills, relating to simultaneous elections, the filling of Senate casual vacancies by a representative of a political party of the same colour as that of the previous senator, the retirement of judges at the age of 70 years and the right of Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory electors to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referenda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another referendum concerns the right of electors in the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referenda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The perceptiveness shown by voters surprised me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a overwhelming yes <span class="highlight">vote</span>, I think, of 90 per cent on the queston of Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was involved in campaigning very strongly for the yes <span class="highlight">vote</span> with my colleague the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people voted quite differently to defeat the proposal on the nexus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People should look at the proposal, think about it, listen to arguments put by the Labor Party, the Liberal Party and the National Country Party and by those who are proposing a No <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and think about each question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will do everything in my power to see that there is a Yes <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the 4 questions in my electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is also necessary to accustom people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> rationally, so I think that is a necessary change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is an effort on the part of my friends opposite to ensure that they never get caught in the same jam as we were in regard to the filling of Senate vacancies, and it is made as the people in the States <span class="highlight">vote</span> increasingly for State Labor governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was carried successfully, with a 93 per cent <span class="highlight">vote</span> in 1967-10 years later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said: ‘We will <span class="highlight">vote</span> no’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two of the better referenda, namely, that relating to simultaneous elections and that relating to electors of the Territories being able to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on referenda, were mixed up with others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would have been a most confusing electoral division to have because the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value would not have been even approximately achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I want the <span class="highlight">vote</span> to start in about 2 minutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I appoint the honourable member for Griffith and the honourable member for Hunter to record the names of those who <span class="highlight">vote</span> aye. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-The honourable member for Wakefield can make it clear tomorrow- or next Tuesday- that he intended to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I was unable to obtain entrance to the chamber and my <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of the Bill was not recorded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would it be possible for my <span class="highlight">vote</span> to be so recorded? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young)  said, we find it odd that it comes before us for discussion in the form of a Bill on which debate is to be adjourned at the second reading stage without a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it and which, after the Parliament is prorogued and the new session commences, will be re-introduced with amendments, some perhaps suggested by members of this House and of course some suggested by persons outside the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He represents an area that does not support those who believe in trade unions, although there are, of course, people in his electorate who do not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for him and they are the people who do support the trade unions; they probably comprise the intelligent sector of his electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I admit that a great number of trade unionists would never <span class="highlight">vote</span> for people on this side of the House, but there are plenty who do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that about SO per cent of trade unionists voted for us at the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members are aware that the second reading debate is proceeding at this stage and that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> will not be taken on it at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think his electors are entitled to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> as nearly as possible equal in value to anybody else ‘s <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Constitution, particularly as now emphasised by the High Court decision, virtually made, despite what other people have said here, a one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value proposition in that the population of the Commonwealththat is, a count of the heads of people- is to be the yardstick upon which we determine the quota for the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly one can really argue from the point of view of electoral justice that as the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value applied in the High Court determination of fixing the quota for States, would not the logical situation be that within the State itself, as far as is practicable, we should as near as possible have equal quotas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am reminded very much of what was said by my predecessor,  Mr Fred  Daly, that only sheep would ever <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a Country Party candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a great many people resident in Australia who, because they do not come from countries which confer British nationality or Irish citizenship, have not had the opportunity to register to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this country as soon as they might. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not for one moment propose that we should be regarded as having a <span class="highlight">vote</span> that ought to be worth less than the votes of rural dwellers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not eligible to register and to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that the electors in the electorate of the honourable member for McPherson, no matter how much capacity he may have- I do not make comment on that- have only half a <span class="highlight">vote</span> each in this Parliament at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember that the former honourable member for Grayndler told people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> early and <span class="highlight">vote</span> often. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the National Country Party, the same Party which rules in Queensland with 29 per cent of the popular <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of his functions is to come into this chamber and cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on a particular issue on behalf of the people who live in the electorate he represents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When honourable members cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this place they ought to be representing as nearly as practicable, to use the words of the Constitution, the same number of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For about the first time it involved the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, so that each of the voting citizens of our country, as nearly as was humanly possible, were fairly and equitably represented in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because of the rump that lives with it- these boundary bushrangers from the National Country Party- it was obliged to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the acceptance of that redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that I will never <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this Parliament or anywhere else against a proposition that allows people with large areas to cover facilities that, in a relatively small electorate of some 1 500 square kilometres, do not need and do not want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should ensure that the majority of people in Australia are not disadvantaged by having their votes downgraded, with my <span class="highlight">vote</span> being worth only half the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of people in the seats of Wimmera or Mallee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Labor Party and many people in this country have been hung up by folklore on this question of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was truly said on an earlier occasion that it is not the way that the people <span class="highlight">vote</span> but the way that the people ‘s votes are counted that matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At 5 per cent above a quota- I would expect that this provision would most likely end up with 8 per cent above a quota being required- there is something like an 89 000 <span class="highlight">vote</span> deficit in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill will attach what happens in Ballaarat to what happens in another seat, and apply a redistribution factor to it which has no relevance to it and which will have the effect of adding possibly 5000 voters to another seat in the metropolitan area which should not have those 5000 voters, except that they happen to be left over when the sums for the special treatment seats are concluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suggestions have been made throughout this debate that the legislation of Labor’s Minister for Administrative Services,  Mr Daly,  was fair and just and that it gave representation on the basis of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the basis of the legislation as it was proposed was that electoral divisions should be considered on the basis of people, be they eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, be they babies, or be they aliens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that will only be achieved when there is full acceptance of the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that even if the Labor Party did get the majority <span class="highlight">vote</span>- I agree that at the moment it would not be a legitimate government in Queensland, Western Australia or Victoria because it does not have the majority <span class="highlight">vote</span>- it still could not win office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could not win in any of those 3 States if it obtained 50.1 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I ask in this democratic country is that if a party obtains the majority <span class="highlight">vote</span>, it be in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party lacked a majority- my recollection is that it was by 7 seats- yet it obtained a majority of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seats should be decided by the law of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value, as they are decided by the Constitution, and whatever boundaries are drawn up by the Electoral Office, whether it be at three or five or seven-year intervals, should be the ones that apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1969, 1972 and 1974 New South Wales strongly voted for the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us assume that we had narrowly missed out on achieving office and that the present Government was in power and it decided that if an election at large were held it could be assured, under proportional representationthis is what I assume an election at large would be because I cannot see any other way of doing it- of about 42 per cent to 45 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He held that section 24 of the Constitution required the implementation of the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value, as nearly as practicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>National Country Party members, both in the other place and in this House, have complained about this legislation, despite their commitment to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it, claiming that it disadvantages their constituents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Burke pointed out that in his opinion the duties of a member were, firstly, to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on behalf of his constituents and, secondly, to interview constituents personally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us look at the sacred academic argument of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the territorial population is eligible to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, to pay taxes, and we presume soon to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referenda, surely it is consistent that it be included in determining the size of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The citizens of Australia pick a number of us for many different reasons but when we sit in this House we each <span class="highlight">vote</span> as one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value and we are counted for ourselves and ourselves alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is time the Parliament established the principle of equality of electorates, the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Parliament will reject the propositions contained in this Bill and that honourable members on the other side of the House who stood up, but not quite firmly enough, for a principle, will at last relent in thendeparture from the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value and proper and equal representation and reject the domination of the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When you add those 3 things together, I am not sure what you get- I will not call it humbug or hypocrisy- but let us just put the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value in its place, because to try to espouse it in a logical way just is not possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, the Constitution itself belies the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not take a great mathematician to work out that that system immediately takes one away from the one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the founding fathers had intended that one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value be written into the Constitution, they would hardly have left it in that form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore in that sense the Constitution does not espouse the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So again you cannot have one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value; it just is not possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not have to take honourable members through the figures, but it can be seen that again you do not get one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So again you do not get one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Really the Labor Partyhas never espoused the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value except in this chamber when its members take part in debates on electoral matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was not one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value; far from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Labor Party has not espoused the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value in terms of what it has done outside this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition has spoken in this debate and has espoused the principle again of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this an indication of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where is the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value in that? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am only saying this because I believe a lot of nonsense is spoken and espoused around the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not suggesting that a principle is not involved in this, but lt is a very broad principle, for the simple reason that it is just not practicable to achieve the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that respect the Commonwealth tradition not only establishes so much the inheritance of the British parliamentary system of which this Parliament is part, but also preserves the opportunities for each of us as citizens of this country through the monarchical system to participate in determining the government which we desire and the representatives for whom we <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am quite confident that they will give a resounding <span class="highlight">vote</span> to the Labor candidates and show the Government just what they think of its policies for Canberra- policies of deliberately inducing unemployment and hardship in an area in which there is no justification whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The extent of their power was demonstrated at a meeting of the Liberal Party State Council in Sydney last month, where, according to the  Australian,  the group effectively controlled the meeting and ‘delivered a stinging <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence in the State executive and the most senior officials of the Party’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw to the attention of the House that less than 4 years later, despite that <span class="highlight">vote</span> and without any changes in the law, moves are well in hand to bring into Canberra 2 organisations that specialise in wholesale abortions, virtually on demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There can be only one answer: Let the Government bring in a comprehensive plan for the rationalisation of the industry or this year let it agree to the Opposition’s proposal of $3 a box for apples and $1.40 a case for pears so that the growers will not be left on the poverty line, as the National Country Party and the Liberal Party would wish- subservient people, in their view, happy to take what is modestly handed out from Canberra in the hope that they will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for those parties at the ensuing election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Assuming that both organisations are required to hold a ballot, under the provisions of the Act at least 50 per cent of the members entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> must <span class="highlight">vote</span> and at least 50 per cent plus one of the formal votes recorded must be in favour of the amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The health services, the educational services and the building of local government were carried out only by a Labor Government- a government that believed in one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is exactly what the National Party should do because the Liberal Party has been misrepresenting the people who <span class="highlight">vote</span> for that Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we get away from the one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value system we are disenfranchising just as many people who <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Liberal Party as <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So there can be no break away from the one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So Liberal Party influence in that State will be nowhere near the influence that it should hold according to the number of votes it receives in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until we have the one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value system there will be no respect for the parliamentary system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is not just the gerrymander nor the 10 per cent or 20 per cent tolerance between urban and rural voters but all different systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sad thing is that the Labor Party cannot get over the fact that it simply cannot win a majority of Australian votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead of counting voters, Labor would have counted the youngest babies, it would have counted children, it would have counted visitors to the country, it would have counted unnaturalised migrants and it would have counted aliens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Members of the Opposition have the hide to come into this House and talk about electoral gerrymanders when in their time in office they sought to destroy the very democratic basis of the electoral system which-we heard the words from the honourable member for Port Adelaide- is based on the proposition that one <span class="highlight">vote</span> has one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have sought to preserve is the clear proposition that one <span class="highlight">vote</span> shall have one value and that no seat shall be more than 10 per cent above quota or less than 10 per cent below quota. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I point out that under the redistribution which was implemented by the Liberal and Country Parties in 1968 the Labor Party went to the polls in 1972 and won the election with 49 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is important in this situation is that, given the opportunity to bring about a redistribution for this Parliament,  Mr Daly,  the former honourable member for Grayndler, proposed a redistribution which would have allowed the Labor Party to hold office with a <span class="highlight">vote</span> as low as 45 per cent of the popular <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its policies in respect of the fruit industry have gone up and down like a lavatory seat depending on where it thinks it can pick up a few votes, because it is only 12 months ago that Labor Party spokesmen were in fact recommending that the stabilisation scheme be phased out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They brought forward this fraudulent amendment, which I will discuss in a moment, for which nobody in his right mind could <span class="highlight">vote</span>, because the effect of it is to put at risk the entire stabilisation scheme as it operates at the moment, inadequate though it may be in the opinion of some people, and to sell the fruit growers of Australia a pup. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I saw the fruit growers of the Huon go to the polling booths in December 1 972 and <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Labor Party because they believed that the Labor Party would do something for them, but within 12 months they were betrayed and every conceivable promise put forward on behalf of the Labor Party in that election campaign was dishonoured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is all very well for honourable members opposite to sneer and say: ‘Come across the chamber and <span class="highlight">vote</span> with us’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have not seen the honourable member for Shortland  (Mr Morris)  or any other honourable members opposite who happen to be in the chamber at the moment coming across to <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government ruined that chance and it will be blamed for it because by cheap political grandstanding it destroyed efforts which were being made on behalf of the fruit industry by the Tasmanian back benchers and created a situation in which no honourable member with any honour could <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not suggest that if those several concerned Government supporters who come from Tasmania <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Opposition on this matter that we will save the situation immediately, but it will be a lesson lashed through to the indifferent mind of the Prime Minister and especially of the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  who endeavours outside this place to convey the impression that he is concerned about rural producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I am saying is that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken in this chamber and if the Government wants any change in the criminal law of the Australian Capital Territory there is only one procedure of integrity, and that is to introduce a Bill to take responsibility for the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although I am proud of the high personal <span class="highlight">vote</span> I receive from the electors of Hotham, I recognise that I am here by virtue of my former membership of the Liberal Party and therefore believe it is proper that I should generally give my <span class="highlight">vote</span> in support of the Government in the business before the House and in the conduct of the business of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I will exercise the right- which is already held by all members of the Liberal Party- to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Government on any issue which a member believes to be not in the best interests of the country or his constituents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The debate was then adjourned, although I was given an undertaking by the Leader of the House on the night on which the debate took place that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> would be taken on it that night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the undertaking given to me by the Leader of the House  (Mr Sinclair)  I was prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one on which this nation will be asked to express an opinion on 21 May in a referendum which will be seeking approval for people in the Territories at least to have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in future referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why should its representatives in this House want to give the people in the Northern Territory a <span class="highlight">vote</span> or even the right to representation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the High Court in May were to determine that within the meaning of the Constitution, representation for the Territories does not mean representation in the full sense of the word but means perhaps only the right for a territorial representative to appear in a Parliament and speak when invited, and does not mean the right to take part in any debate and certainly not the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, territorial representatives would be mere mummies from the point of view of effective representation of the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of discussions at the Constitutional Convention meetings it was virtually unanimously agreed that we should submit to the people of Australia a referendum on 21 May asking whether they would allow the people in the Territories to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at future referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that they will <span class="highlight">vote</span> yes and we will encourage them to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  urged again yesterday all Australia to give the people in the Territories the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we are the major political forces in the country urging the people on 2 1 May to give the people in the Territories the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If those challenges are successful, irrespective of what the decision of the Australian people is on 2 1 May- we would hope it would be a decision giving the people of the Territories a right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in future referendums- it would be null and void for the very reason that section 128 only gives to the electors in the States- we seek to interpose there the words ‘and the Territories’- the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a referendum in the same context as they would have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the election of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Irrespective of what happens on 2 1 May, the High Court may decide in May that the people of the Territories have no right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for a representative in the House of Representatives and therefore exclude them from the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in future referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are spending millions of dollars putting a proposition to the people saying to them that we have an act of Parliament that will interpose the words ‘and the Territories’ after the word ‘State’ in section 128 of the Constitution so that under that section people in the territories will have the same rights to <span class="highlight">vote</span> as people in the States have for House of Representatives elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A substantial majority of the people of Australia could well say that the people in the Territories should have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referendums, but their decision could be declared null and void by a judicial decision that the Territories have no right to representation in this House or in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They seek to use that sort of ‘democratic’ principle to say by way of interpretation that other Australians will not have any representation and, not only that, but also no right at all to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is very important at the present time to say: ‘We want to give these people in the Territories the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How strange it must seem to those soldiers, sailors and airmen who fought for this country and who have been transferred to Canberra to find that when they were in Queensland or in other States they were able to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on federal issues and on referendums but that when they came across an artificial line to live in Canberra they lost those rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will remember that this proposal will grant the Australian citizen who lives in the Northern Territory or the Australian Capital Territory the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that, like every other Australian, people living in the Territories pay taxes and are required to obey the same federal laws as the people of the States, they do not have a right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the time of Federation the areas now known as the Northern Territory and the Austraiian Capital Territory were respectively part of South Australia and New South Wales and the people then living there were able to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A Yes <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the referendum would ensure that over 150 000 voters living in the Territories would have the same basic rights as the rest of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not without significance that the fine old elder statesman of Australia,  Sir Robert  Menzies, has indicated in the Press today that he personally favours a Yes <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the referendum for the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Morgan gallop poll released in  The Bulletin  dated 2 April- which is somewhat ahead of its time- I see that 83 per cent of the people in Queensland support the right of Territorians to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At that meeting there were placards saying ‘No <span class="highlight">vote</span>, no voice’ There were all sorts of placards pointing out to the people who saw the television coverage later on that we considered that we had the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at that referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Victoria, which is not a notably liberal State, using that word in the English sense and not giving it the prostituted definition that it is given in politics on the other side of the House- using the word ‘liberal ‘ in the sense of treating people as equals- it is now possible for anybody to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in municipal elections whether they are naturalised or not as long as they are occupiers of property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that all the people in South Australia will now accept that it is right to have one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value in the House of Assembly and that it is right and correct in a bicameral system that the Legislative Council itself be elected on the most just terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he did put it to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of his own members, he knows that the stand that he has adopted would not be supported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I cannot cross the floor and <span class="highlight">vote</span> against my Government’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore my aim tonight is to do 2 things: Firstly, to commend and thank the Government for honouring its promise to bring back this motion for parliamentary debate; and secondly, to test the House by moving an amendment which I will try, by using all the forms of the House, to press to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, after moving the amendment I will simply sit down and hope that some honourable member seconds it so that the amendment will appear on the notice paper and honourable members will be given an opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When he pretends to act as  President  of the ACTU as opposed to acting as the  President  of the Labor Party, this Government is justified in believing that he is acting as the  President  of the Labor Party, committed to the political destruction of this Government; that he is ignoring the interests of the trade union movement whose interests are not the interests of the parliamentary Opposition in this Parliament; that he is ignoring the interests of 40 per cent of trade union members who <span class="highlight">vote</span> Liberal Party or National Country Party at elections and who certainly did so at the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Hawke  has demonstrated his utter incapacity not only to represent those members in the trade union movement who <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Liberal Party or National Country Party- that is, about 40 per cent of them- but also to serve the interests of the trade union movement in a bipartisan manner and a manner that ought to befit the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has indicated clearly that he does not believe, and his Government does not believe, that persons outside the Parliament have any right other than to express a triennial <span class="highlight">vote</span> at elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having disposed of that argument in a Little while on the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Committee, the next question I put is ‘that the Bill, as amended, be agreed to’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I  preface my question, which is directed to the Minister for Defence, by pointing  out that in 1975-76 some $148m of a total defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> of $1.8 billion was allocated to defence equipment and stores- hardware, as it is called- according to the publication  Public A Authority Finance: Federal Authorities  released by the Australian Statistician. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I should have thought that the influence and the clout that the National Country Party usually brings to bear on the government of the day would have been exercised much more if members of the National Country Party were completely honest in their endeavours and desires to assist those who <span class="highlight">vote</span> for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is appropriate that  God Save the Queen  should be used on regal and vice-regal occasions, but I am concerned at the obvious way in which the Government is determined to have it used on all occasions and to exclude such songs as  Advance Australia Fair  by ensuring that the people do not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already the Government is using the donkey <span class="highlight">vote</span> by deciding that  God Save the Queen,  for some reason or other, shall be placed at the top of the ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet this <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the United Nations was preceded by a series of actions which implied not only an appeasement of the Jakarta generals- particularly the most extremist elements of the Jakarta generals- but also a tacit recognition of the incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-21-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say again that the essence of the proposal is a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence in the direction of ASIO and the head of ASIO who was appointed by the Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770504_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable gentleman is sincere and really wants to test it in this way, I invite him to rephrase his question so that the answer to it would bring a Yes <span class="highlight">vote</span> from the people of Australia and see how far he then goes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The honourable member for Maranoa, who of course is the member of the same Party as the Premier of that State, tells me that it is a coalition government and the coalition got more than that percentage of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consequently I feel that it is very important that issues are referred back to Canberra so that the government can give full and proper consideration to them before it makes a decision as to what our position will be in New York and before we translate that decision into action in the form of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in New York. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seemed a bit absurd to me that when we cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the issue of the French islands off the African coast and, instead of following a policy which would have been more in keeping with Australia’s best interests, we slavishly followed the policy laid down by <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that there is every prospect that notwithstanding there being more Government supporters in the Senate, in that House the majority of members will <span class="highlight">vote</span> to refer this matter to a select committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A recent referendum to ensure that all office-holders were elected by a direct <span class="highlight">vote</span> of all students resulted in IS 000 students voting in favour of this proposal and only 5000 against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because 20 campuses did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the issue the proposal was lost because non-voting campuses were regarded under the rules which apply for referendums as favouring the continuation of the existing system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless we will continue, at the completion of the discussion on this Bill, to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it because not only do we object to specific items of change but also we object as strongly as possible to the inclusion of the provision which now attempts, by the interpretation which has been given to it in the House, to cover secondary boycotts and the role of trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can imagine the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  entering the next election campaign and telling the electors: ‘My Government has been unable to solve the problem of inflation, we have caused unemployment to rise substantially but you must <span class="highlight">vote</span> for us because we have cut public expenditure and we have cut the deficit’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is as well to remind the House also of another notable aspect of that referendum, that it achieved the highest Yes <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the history of referendums in Australia- 89 per cent, which is even better than some of the Yes votes that were achieved in the last referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is what that honourable member is going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member’s interjection illustrates the point I made at the beginning of my speech that he will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for something of which he is obviously not aware. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will hurt people who normally <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it and support it financially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Parliament going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for such legislation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Liberal Party going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for such legislation seeing that it champions the ordinary person, the worker? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are members of the Liberal Party going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for legislation which gives a Minister or an authority on the instruction of a Minister, power to stand down a trade unionist when his inactivity has absolutely nothing to do with himself? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unionists who <span class="highlight">vote</span> for action and those who fail to <span class="highlight">vote</span> will all be caught in the net. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that if there was not provision in the Bill for an appeal he would <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of members who attend to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at many meetings often is far below the reasonable percentage that one ought to expect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My interpretation after listening to the honourable member for Canberra  (Mr Haslem)  is that on principle he has to walk over here tonight and <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only will he lose his seat but also 20 or 25 honourable members on the Government side could lose their seats without the Labor Party going out into the streets to get the people’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> if the election is held in December this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But honourable members opposite will not receive an extra <span class="highlight">vote</span> if they take on the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That amalgamation was effectively consummated last Monday night when, by a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of eight to four on the executive, it was decided that the amalgamation should occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amalgamation was proposed by a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the executive in terms of the New South Wales Act which allows such an amalgamation to occur without any reference whatsoever to the rank and file members of either union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within the Federal jurisdiction, we know that there has to be a reference of such a matter to the rank and file members of unions and there has to be a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of 50 per cent of the members of the union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman talked about giving everybody a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the clearest most cynical way the Government gave its own <span class="highlight">vote</span> of no confidence in a Budget less than two days old. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I excuse myself from seeking to explain some of the criticism that has been launched against the figure given by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech concerning the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770824_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To a large extent we are hiding our heads in the sand if we take it for granted that improving the research and promotion <span class="highlight">vote</span> alone is going to help the industry when we are not able to market wool as a commodity in a competitive textile world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770824_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, I suggest that the <span class="highlight">vote</span> be changed so that the <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the cadets is not confined just to camp and so that every cadet is allowed to have the full Army <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the whole year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770824_reps_30_hor106/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a pity that we do not concentrate our efforts and our time on the Budget for a limited period until the discussions are concluded and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken in the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the referendum on the Constitution alteration should therefore be seen against the background of his publicly stated preference for a retirement age of 65 years for judges of this particular Federal court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Hunter mentions the point I was about to make, the right of women to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been asked: ‘Do sheep <span class="highlight">vote</span> for you? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we reflect on the first reactor that produced the bombs that fell on Hiroshima or Nagasaki- those who have seen the result and the terrifying concept of what can develop out of this industry would know- I wonder whether honourable members opposite might have a second thought about the decisions taken, with great haste, in the immediate past and about to be taken this evening when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken it was the members of the Labor Party in the main who were responsible for defeating an amendment that was in line with Labor Party policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite will be asking them to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in support of the Government so that more countries in the world will have nuclear bombs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understood from the Government side that the Government wanted a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this matter tonight and I was prepared to forgo my place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were hoping to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> this evening.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said to him: ‘If you want to have a <span class="highlight">vote</span> this evening I am prepared not to speak.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp)  has raised a number of cogent points that need to be answered, but the first thing I should say is that I am told there will be a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This House will <span class="highlight">vote</span> tonight and will make a decision on an issue of great importance not only to this country but also to the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not elected to represent only the people who voted for me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Collectively, we in this Parliament are elected to represent all the people of Australia, not just the people who happened to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for us in the December 1975 election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for honourable members opposite in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Sullivan)  said today- I almost hate to quote it- that women should not have been given the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If some members on the other side of the House would come across and <span class="highlight">vote</span> with us we would at last have a sensible decision, a sensible policy, for the people of Australia, not only for the present generation but also for future generations to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am not going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Budget which embodies that strategy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, I cannot <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this Budget, but I have, of course, no intention of voting with the Labor Party, even if it has copied some of the ideas which I put forward originally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly endorse the strategy adopted by the Government to protect the Budget <span class="highlight">vote</span> which is apportioned to disadvantaged groups in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I happen to represent a smallish electorate, which has the good sense to <span class="highlight">vote</span> Labor very solidly, I work at it, I hope pretty effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not support the theory that people will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for constitutional change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regrettably, the No case campaigners misrepresented the situation by contending that a Yes <span class="highlight">vote</span> would weaken local government by making it subordinate to the Federal Government and to Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Forty-three per cent of them do not contribute to a fighting fund; they do not attend a stop work meeting or a union meeting; they do not <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a union election; a number of those 43 per cent claim that industrial action is useless; they talk of their union being communist controlled, undemocratic or inefficiently managed, yet they complain about their rates of pay and conditions of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Double taxation was a major issue in the New South Wales election and when voters grasped the full import of what the conservatives who are running the Commonwealth at the present time were trying to do, they rejected the Commonwealth’s counterpart in the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every car owner when he casts his <span class="highlight">vote</span> on Saturday might well remember that and <span class="highlight">vote</span> solidly against the Labor candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> there was eight to four. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> would otherwise have been 12 nil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> looks like being eight to seven. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>He said that the people should <span class="highlight">vote</span> Liberal in the election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope he follows me and tells me why the electorate did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> Liberal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable members overlook the important factor facing the people of Australia which is that they have the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on performance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That freedom means freedom for people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> as they wish without fear of penalty or sanction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a pity that it does not come out with some coherent and decent policies that might encourage people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After almost a century of democratic <span class="highlight">vote</span> recording the Labor Party would, in one stroke, remove the secrecy from the ballot box. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He wrote to the electors in that ward advising them that voting was compulsory, that there would be a $5 fine if they did not <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is more, the Labor member for Ashfield possibly bordered on an infringement of the Electoral Act because he solicited postal votes in his electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if he looks at how the two distinguished gentlemen I mentioned postponed their retirement because there might be a different government coming in surely he will agree that there is some sense of political assessment and political affiliation even in our top court, as there must be with everybody in this nation because we all have to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They neglected to go into the parliamentary chamber to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on a motion of no confidence in the Premier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should consider whether he should <span class="highlight">vote</span> on a motion of censure such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not a matter of money, although I suppose a larger <span class="highlight">vote</span> would be needed for committees if we wanted to make them effective by providing appropriate staff and research assistants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will know that after newspaper articles and parliamentary questions which showed that electoral officers had given incorrect advice to ctizens of Commonwealth countries, particularly Cyprus and Malta, on their voting rights in Australia, the Chief Electoral Officer sent a circular to all divisional returning officers saying that Commonwealth nationals who have resided in Australia for six months are eligible to be enrolled as voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government make it known that Commonwealth nationals are not only eligible to be enrolled as voters but are also required to be enrolled and that, under Australia’s system of compulsory enrolment and voting, they are subject to the same penalties as Australian citizens for failing to enrol and <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion that in some way the representation involved in great areas, particularly rural districts, needs to be offset by damaging the democratic principle of one man, one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value relates to another responsibility of the Department of Administrative Services, and that is the facilities made available to members of parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However I believe there is immense lack of dignity in the situation of half a million migrants who live in this country without the <span class="highlight">vote</span> because nobody has bothered to go and talk to them, to explain what their rights are and to help them take out citizenship if they decide they want to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One thing which was noticeable in the State election was the extremely high <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Labor Party in the City of Whyalla. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can look for the reasons for this extremely high <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the conclusion of the debate it was one of those Liberal senators that had signed the letter in Whyalla who moved the gag, and when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken all the Liberal senators opposed  Senator Bishop’s  motion, even though it was along the lines they had agreed to in Whyalla, and concerning which they had put their names to a letter agreeing to approach the Government to seek implementation of the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Canada in 1974 the largest enrolment was 125,000 voters in Yorke-Scarborough and the smallest was 12,300 voters in Yukon- a difference of 1 12,000 voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Britain regards her electoral laws as being based on one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value but applies that principle, even in such a small, compact country, in ways that take greater account of factors such as remoteness, communication difficulties and distances, than we do in this vast continent of ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Britain, in other words, does not adopt the rigid, unthinking, mathematical approach that we do, but tries to see that voters in every part of the country have some opportunity for equality of representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is about time there was an end to all the nonsense and hypocrisy about one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Discrimination against Aborigines has diluted the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of all other Australians in the Kalgoorlie electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence was given that 34 Aborigines had been deprived of their right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> at that polling booth alone by this ‘trick’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence also was given that the Liberal lawyers deliberately humiliated and confused Aboriginal voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is why this electorate is being made still largerbecause Liberal lawyers and other Liberals have deterred Aborigines from exercising their right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> as Australian electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to mention one other form of discrimination, and that is the discrimination against persons who are Commonwealth citizens, in particular citizens from Cyprus and Malta and who therefore, under our laws, are not only entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> after they have resided in Australia for six months but are compelled to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government make it known that Commonwealth nationals are not only eligible to be enrolled as voters but also required to be enrolled and that, under Australia’s system of compulsory enrolment and voting, they are subject to the same penalties as Australian citizens for failing to enrol and <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are as the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G.

    <p>I do not think I will be saying anything new tonight, but I wish to say a few words about this catch cry ‘one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  in speaking in this debate earlier this afternoon talked about one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value and mentioned the United States as being an example of where that catch cry is practised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value in this country must be considered at a Federal level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me at the outset from looking at the quotas that there is a discrepancy in the principle of one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is called ‘one <span class="highlight">vote</span> one value’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much for one <span class="highlight">vote</span>, one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that in this chamber we should suggest that the philosophy or policy of a party is all that is required to get a member in this House; that any member from any seat comes in here purely to be a number, and participate in votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely that is what representation is all about I was appalled tonight when the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  got off this subject while speaking and tried, for cheap political motives, to attract the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Kalgoorlie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Then he switched to the Maltese and Cypriot <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is very clever at trying to arrange the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the minority groups in this country but he misses the main point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently he took his grandson to see the Australian cricketers, purely to get votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no sympathy whatsoever for the view that we ought to have a differential that is related to distances or anything else because in this Parliament we make the decisions for the nation in the votes on the floor of the House and the numbers in Australian politics are so finely balanced that when one changes the numbers one changes the <span class="highlight">vote</span> here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the redistribution proposal for Western Australia is, to begin with, totally unfair to the National Country Party which in that State gets sufficient votes to merit its having one seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-84">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The redistribution in the metropolitan areas is what I might call the philosophy of  Senator Withers  which is how to immobilise the Labor <span class="highlight">vote</span> by confining it to a very few super-safe areas while at the same time ehminating the National Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-84">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the votes in Western Australia split 50-50 the seats went 50-50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-84">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of the suspension of Standing Orders that censure motion against the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  was carried overwhelrningly, the <span class="highlight">vote</span> being 67 votes in favour and only 27 Labor votes against. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-90">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After those three years many people changed their <span class="highlight">vote</span>; many Australian working men who had always voted Labor decided that they would not support the Labor Party any longer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771102_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the previous Parliament, despite aU that could have been said about the conduct of the House, even during Budget discussions, private members’ business on the day on which it was listed was given precedence and aU matters were taken to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771102_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They know what they are doing, and that will be reflected in their <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the two forthcoming elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771102_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have expressed that in Federal elections; they have expressed it previously in State elections; and they will do it on Saturday week, when in my view the Labor Party will be lucky to get 35 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771102_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wondered how we could have made such a terrible mistake as to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against a socialistic Bill and how the Minister could make such a terrible mistake as to bring in a socialistic Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, from the point of view of the principles of what democracy is all about, we are faced with the position that if we were to oppose it to the extent of defeating it we could not possibly give anybody a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on a division basis within a State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind members of the House that, when they come into the chamber to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and they find the same people causing the trouble, it will be because the honourable member for Bendigo  (Mr Bourchier)  is doing his duty in his inimitable way and because we on this side are doing our duty as we see it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I preface my question to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations by reminding him and the House that among the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which take great care to ensure that members of unions are able to participate effectively in the affairs of their unions are three sections: Section 133, which gives to all financial members of the union the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>; section 152, which requires that union secretaries keep a correct account of union ticket butts; and section 170 A, which requires union secretaries to supply to the Commonwealth Electoral Office full particulars of all butts which they have in their possession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At Mt Isa in Queensland more than 1,000 financial members of the union have been refused the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister know that when complaints were made to the electoral officer the electoral officer told the members that he cannot get from the union secretary concerned a list of the members who are entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and that the union secretary is in breach of the Act and nothing is being done about it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to know from the honourable gentleman now what action he proposes to take to ensure that all members of the Australian Workers Union who want to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for or against the present office holders shall be given the right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, providing they are financial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Has the attention of the  Deputy  Prime Minister been drawn to threats in the last week by the Queensland Premier, first to the residents of Mount Isa and later repeated to the electors and residents of Mackay and Rockhampton, that their areas would be deprived of State funds if they did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the National Party next Saturday? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would think at first sight that that meant that since $8m has been provided this year, the subsequent <span class="highlight">vote</span> under this Act, in each of the following two years, would be $8m in real terms at 1977 prices and expressed in whatever amount that equals in 1978-79 or 1979-80. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without boasting may I say that the worst <span class="highlight">vote</span> I ever received was on my first election, my best <span class="highlight">vote</span> percentagewise ever recorded was on my last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unlike the honourable member for Wimmera  (Mr King),  who said that he had his lowest <span class="highlight">vote</span> when he first came into Parliament and his highest at his last election, I had my highest <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the second election in which I participated and my lowest <span class="highlight">vote</span> at the last election, in December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To the electors of New South Wales, to those who are to the extreme Right, to those Liberals who have some doubt about where the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  stands, as to whether he might be veering deep down in his heart towards socialism, let me say this: If they want to be absolutely certain of having a senator who will never show the slightest sign of weakness towards the Left or even towards the centre, or even to those who are bad enough to be just right of centre, they can do no better than to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the honourable member for Mackellar for the Senate because he will never betray them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of the Government’s decision in November 1976 to devalue the Australian dollar and also taking into account subsequent fluctuations in the exchange rate, what were the additional costs, in November 1976 prices, borne by the Defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> for procurement of items of capital equipment for which contracts had been let to overseas suppliers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-130">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From time to time we have been gratified to find not only that our judgment has been supported, predictably, by all members of the Opposition but also that we have garnered the occasional additional <span class="highlight">vote</span> from the Government side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780221_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In conclusion,  Mr Speaker,  I regret very much that you did not read out the telegram prior to the <span class="highlight">vote</span> being taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780221_reps_31_hor108/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The telegram was germane to the <span class="highlight">vote</span> being conducted and you had a responsibility to convey to the House the contents of that telegram on behalf of the honourable member for Lyne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780221_reps_31_hor108/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apparently it was an honest <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the party room but it was rumoured that he had been put aside because he had been too impartial to members of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780221_reps_31_hor108/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I did my best behind the scenes to organise a <span class="highlight">vote</span> against you. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The tendency among the affluent who blandly <span class="highlight">vote</span> Liberal is to contend that we have equal opportunity already. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the first place, he reflected that the number of electors who are opting to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the major parties in all the countries of the democratic West is decreasing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that an increasing proportion of the electorate was making the decision that it would <span class="highlight">vote</span> for some new organisation, for some extra political organisation or for a party with a very short history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That ought to cause political parties to look to their merits in making their own decisions as to where the votes lie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To rely upon a rigid class <span class="highlight">vote</span> as has been the case in the past will not suffice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the town of Kerry in my electorate- the Labor Party will need to go right back to square one when it hears what its standing is- a town of some 141 voters, the Australian Labor Party gained five votes, which represents 3 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that the Government’s concern with the Baltic states was an exercise in cheap <span class="highlight">vote</span> buying from the captive nations’ representatives in this country, because its action in recognising the incorporation of East Timor was certainly not a matter of principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Fred Nile Senate Team will let the ruling party know the ‘silent majority’ of decent Australians support good standards and reject legalised brothels, incest, sodomy, et=, and the permissive views of Don Chipp (Little Red School Book),  Mr Billington’s  marijuana party and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advertisement then sets out a how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> guide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advertisement suggests that if a voter is voting for the Fred Nile Senate team and supports the Liberal-Country Party he should <span class="highlight">vote</span> 1, 2 and 3 for the Fred Nile Senate team, then <span class="highlight">vote</span> 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 for Chipp’s team and then <span class="highlight">vote</span> 26, 27 and 28 for what the advertisement calls ‘Whitlam’s Team’, in other words, the Australian Labor Party’s team. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand if a voter wanted to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Fred Nile team and the Labor Party the advertisement suggests the voter should <span class="highlight">vote</span> 1, 2, 3 for Nile, Scarf and Judge, then <span class="highlight">vote</span> 26, 27 and 28 for the marihuana team and 29, 30 and 31 for what the advertisement calls ‘Fraser’s Team’, in other words, the Liberal-Country Party team. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So whilst Fred Nile’s Senate team seems very strong on the question of marihuana and on the question of permissiveness, et cetera, it does not seem to affect its actual advice as to how people should <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Very often Liberal voting is a reinforcement of an optimistic self image, since the people who <span class="highlight">vote</span> Liberal sometimes have to say: ‘We are a cut above the others in this street. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps one of the strangest aspects of all as I say, is that it has persuaded large urban populations of Australia that they ought to be prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the party of the graziers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is also extraordinary in many ways that the area of greatest success for the Liberal Party and its allies has been in securing the votes of women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party has been successful in persuading the women of Australia that they ought to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Party which has never expressed any interest at all for the status of or the possibility of greater options for women in Australian society and to reject the Party which does invite women to consider that there may be options they may take other than the traditional role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party, of course, attracts very many traditional votes, but I suspect that one of the reasons why many people in this essentially apolitical society of ours prefer to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Liberal Party is that the Liberal Party seems to be less like a political party than does the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The right honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  now the Prime Minister, when he took office against the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of confidence in the House, acted in treason against the parliamentary system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition would not be so churlish as to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Prime Minister’s motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet a record <span class="highlight">vote</span>- probably the highest percentage <span class="highlight">vote</span> ever recorded in any kind of election or referendum in Australiagave to the Federal Government the power to control and to legislate on Aboriginal affairs and the power for that legislation to override all State legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Minister is conducting his wars with the Department of Finance over the next few months about the appropriations for his Department for the next financial year he could at least suggest that appropriations such as this one might come out to the Defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of the task, in its entirety, should not be charged against the Defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>, in my judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Labor Party polled 42 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and won 38 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The National Country Party, whose members want to crow about that Party’s great representation in the House, polled 10 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> and won 18 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Expressing those percentages as numbers of people, 3,800,000 people voted for the Liberal-National Country Party coalition to give it 86 seats; 3, 170,000 people voted for the Labor Party to give it 38 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I challenge the Opposition, in fact all honourable members from Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Adelaide, to remember that when they <span class="highlight">vote</span> tonight they virtually will be saying that people in their cities are paying too little for their petrol and that they should be paying more in order to subsidise the poor people in Tasmania and in the country areas who have been penalised for too long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When honourable members <span class="highlight">vote</span> tonight they should remember that quite clearly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the honourable gentleman indicated was that he would <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment, and properly so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight when honourable members consider whether or not they will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the politically biased amendment moved by the Labor Opposition they should not lose sight of the fact that the Government is doing its damndest to reduce fuel costs payable by country people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The interesting point,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  is that before a <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken one thinks that suddenly one had become the most popular person in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the moment the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken you are about as popular as a pork chop at somebody’s picnic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because this legislation does not specifically help Tasmania and because this is one part of a two-pronged attack to bring back fair petrol pricing to Australia, why should we be put into the situation of having to say to the rest of Australia that it will not get any benefit under this legislation because we will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is indeed a question which we should all consider carefully and seriously, but the point that I want to make above all other points is that this legislation would not have my support- would not have my <span class="highlight">vote</span>- if it did anything to restrict the right of the Australian citizen, male or female, to follow a particular cause in any corner of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that they will cross the floor and <span class="highlight">vote</span> with honourable members on this side of the House against this obnoxious Bill which, in the history of this Parliament, is one of the most objectionable pieces of legislation ever proposed for use against civilians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So even among servicemen who were fully entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, less than one-thirteenth had enrolled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, the Committee disclosed a technical reason why serving or former armed services personnel were already automatically entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, but this entitlement had not been implemented in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Northern Territory regulations provided for the <span class="highlight">vote</span> for serving or former defence force members but not for wards declared under the Welfare Ordinance, which was another paternalistic provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee of this House in 1961 rejected considerations of alcoholism, bank balance, education, work or housing as having any proper bearing on fitness to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Western Australia had done so we would not have had the disgraceful spectacle last year of a Western Australian Minister being found by a court of disputed returns to have been responsible for putting pressure on illiterate Aborigines not to enrol or not to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, his expressed justification being that many of them had been brainwashed by his Australian Labor Party opponents while he personally found it distasteful to campaign among illiterates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet this sort of shameful interference with the democratic rights of Aboriginal citizens to enrol and to <span class="highlight">vote</span> goes on with impunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not propose to take my full time because I hope that this matter will come to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and that a decision will be arrived at. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Committee was set up after I placed this matter on the Notice Paper, But in whatever way it is done, I think that the matter should come to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> and that a decision should be arrived at today so that we can demonstrate our concern to enable Aborigines to become full citizens and eventually to justify compulsory enrolment as for other citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore the important question that is being asked is not whether the voter understands the whole workings of the political process but simply whether he prefers one of those candidates to another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Australia we have a compulsory preferential voting system in which one can indicate a preference but cast an informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> simply by not completing the whole of the ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Currently they are the subject of special electoral provisions, as has been pointed out by the honourable member for Capricornia inasmuch as they do not have to enrol, but once they do so of course they must <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next matter to which I refer is the acceptance of how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards as evidence of someone’s voting intentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another matter which requires consideration is the introduction of optional preferential voting so that an elector, by simply having declared his preference for one candidate, does not have his <span class="highlight">vote</span> declared informal simply because he does not extend his preferences beyond that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A judge in the Court of Disputed Returns in Western Australia said that he was impressed by the sincerity of the Aboriginal people who tried to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question we must ask ourselves is whether an obligation to <span class="highlight">vote</span> which is placed on Aboriginals in all cases ought to be made compulsory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that Aboriginals have a right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in Federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A situation exists in which Aboriginals are entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and that applies right throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My observation on that problem is that the matter of which he complained really related to whether people who were employed for another purpose ought to be endeavouring to enrol Aboriginals to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problems facing those people are not related so much to the exercise of their right to <span class="highlight">vote</span> or to their capacity to exercise that right, but rather to other questions such as those that the Committee is now considering and those upon which the Committee has already reported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that stage the voting age was still 21, so they must have enrolled almost all those who were entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the subsequent election which occurred throughout Australia some 80 per cent of them did <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no sympathy whatever with the view that because, perhaps, Aboriginals are illiterate in the English language they ought not to be allowed to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, ore that there is no point in offering them the opportunity of voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That a candidate be nominated by no less than 6 members entitled to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the elections in any electorate, together with a nomination fee of $10.00; that if a candidate receives 20 per cent of the successful candidates votes that the nomination fee of $ 10.00 be returned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is known that the Aborigines do not have to enrol, but once they are enrolled they are supposed to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, even though many of them do not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether they do not <span class="highlight">vote</span> because they are disenchanted with the electoral system or because they do not understand it or are pressured in some way is yet to be found out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the reason, they seldom receive the same treatment as Europeans receive if they do not <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not get a follow-up card saying that they will be fined or will have to appear in court if they have not voted or whatever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact at this time on Elcho Island the Labor bloke got a majority of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>, so it is quite obvious that they did not know what  they were doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far more education should be given to Aborigines on how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> and the reasons for voting, explaining who the people are and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should also be control because, as we all know, the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">vote</span> can be swayed very significantly one way or another by various pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think it was the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Dawkins)  who referred to howtovote cards being accepted as a means of identifying a man’s preference for a candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way to do that is for the voter to indicate in the booth the candidate he wants by selecting a photograph. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he has a how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> card, that could be torn up and another one given to him as he goes in the door. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would wave that card and that candidate would get his <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me quickly tabulate some of the charges: Minister charged with involvement in <span class="highlight">vote</span> buying; Minister charged by his own colleagues with being involved in rigging electoral boundaries; Minister involved in murky land deals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attention must be drawn to the fact that certain matters cannot be debated except upon a substantive motion which admits of itself a distinct <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it even if it involves crossing the floor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third thing I want to say is that I have already, on one occasion, publicly voted on the question of retrospectivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the question of taxation, as I recall it, it was passed unanimously without a single dissentient <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My problem is simply this: Having voted for and strongly supported that proposition in 1974, I, bearing in mind the respect in which I hold my colleagues who take a contrary view, find it possible to <span class="highlight">vote</span> publicly now for legislation which creates, as I will demonstrate, a precedent in Australia, because this is the first time in this country that legislation of this nature and the known implications of it passing are to be dealt with by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appeal to all my colleagues on this side of the Committee to think about that precedent and not <span class="highlight">vote</span> now for the amount of money that is involved in this measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legal case which has done most to persuade me, after very long and agonising deliberation, not to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the application of retrospectivity on this occasion is the reasoning of Adam J. in the case of Doro v. Victorian Railways Commissioners in 1960. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to say any more on this matter other than that the views I held last September are the views I will be expressing in the <span class="highlight">vote</span> tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government supporters need not talk it out any longer, so might I suggest that the clause be put to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> so that we can get it over with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is too widely known as a country without an opinion, the last to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on almost any issue and the last to come up with new, positive ideas on international questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most of them tended to come down on the side of supporting the principle of equity, as they showed by their <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every communist country, almost every Third World country, all Arab countries voted unanimously against Israel ostensibly on human rights grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The majority of nations are not persuaded by argument; they <span class="highlight">vote</span> in line with their political or ideological bloc and they cannot afford to do otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be of interest to the House to know that of the 68 nations which voted on the southern African situation only Australia, Canada, Denmark and the United States split their delegate votes between yes and no. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have to spend a couple of minutes of the time of the House this afternoon emphasising some of those figures and putting the argument into perspective so that people will be aware of the significance of the wages content of the total education <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party will not like my doing this, but I take it back to a document which was prepared and circulated throughout Australia in September 1975 and which had a very distinct effect on the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the States of Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland because it said in clear and unequivocal terms what we believed about federalism and what we would do if elected to power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have not the slightest doubt that if the <span class="highlight">vote</span> were to go in favour of integration of East Timor with Indonesia, and the <span class="highlight">vote</span> were properly conducted, it would be accepted by the representatives of Fretilin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I recall, that <span class="highlight">vote</span> was on nonparty lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore I ask honourable members opposite to place a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of confidence in themselves and accept the Opposition’s amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government, with its obtuse approach to employer-employee relations, apparently did not have the faintest idea or inclination that there would be some adverse reaction on the part of these career public servants who had devoted their lives to the Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 24 February 1978 the  Sydney Morning Herald,  in an article headed ‘NSW <span class="highlight">vote</span> supports continued CES bans’, stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we moved an amendment that the primary producers’ representation should be increased he was the only member of the Government to cross the floor and <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Unless our amendment is accepted by the Government or some better reason given for making this alteration to the provision of funds to the Bank than has been given so far, the Opposition will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against that clause in the Committee stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the amendment because of our suspicions and because of the attitude of the Aboriginals towards them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Opposition did not want to oppose all these amendments, but in view of what has happened in Committee, I think that when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken it will have to oppose everything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the legislation went into the Senate a rebellion occurred when six National Country Party senators said that they were going to cross the floor and <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the legislation or move certain amendments to the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that he will speak before the matter is put to the <span class="highlight">vote</span>, to illustrate how he can reconcile what he said on 10 April in his eloquent speech, at page 1297 of  Hansard,  with the import of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, the non-union members of the Executive Board can now outvote the union members because the  Chairman,  who will be appointed by the Minister without any obligation to consult the unions, has both a deliberative and a casting <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out in regard to the Executive Board of eight persons that clause 8T (4) provides that the  Chairman  of the Board has a casting <span class="highlight">vote</span>, which means in a tight situation with four unionists opposing four nonunionists the  Chairman,  who is appointed by the Minister- the bureaucrat- will have control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think people will tend to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against self-government simply because they do not know what is meant by the term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The High Court of Australia has upheld the rights of members from the Territory to be here and to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in full. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would imagine that many of the people here will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for some form of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Others will <span class="highlight">vote</span>, no doubt, for the status quo, but that will be their own choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the Government would hope that by 1980 when the Australian people are called on to <span class="highlight">vote</span> again the electorate will say: ‘Oh,  Mr Street  told us in 1978 it was going to become worse; there is nothing that can be done about it; we have to accept it’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was part of the big lie to the Australian electorate last year to get people to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Government But now the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has exposed all that fabrication by his statement of truth to the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge them to ignore the rantings, ravings and stand-over tactics of the Government Whip and to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment moved in all sincerity by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might add that it was defeated because of support for the Government by all the members from Tasmania, except the honourable member for Franklin  (Mr Goodluck)  who failed to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side will be interested to see whether the honourable member for Franklin votes on this occasion instead of being locked in the toiletinadvertently of course- as he was during the last division on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will also be interested to see the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the honourable member for Denison  (Mr Hodgman),  the honourable member for Wilmot  (Mr Burr),  the honourable member for Braddon  (Mr Groom)  and the honourable member for Bass  (Mr Newman),  both of whom are Ministers in this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year all of those members voted against the similar amendment put forward by the Opposition to increase the stabilisation payment to $3 per box. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore we want to see whether they will support it or whether they will go their way and be covered by the Government Whip and the Liberal-National Country Party majority and <span class="highlight">vote</span> with other honourable members on that side of the House to make sure that there will not be any splits in the Government’s ranks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will be interested to see whether the honourable member will squib the issue again as he did last year and <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the interests of Tasmanians or whether he will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on that particular Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Hansard  shows quite clearly at the bottom of page 369 the names of those who voted ‘ aye ‘ and who voted against the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only name which is not listed under the ayes’, the ‘noes’ or the pairs is that of the honourable member for Franklin who, as I said, was inadvertently locked in the toilet because he did not have the courage to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a pity he does not carry his argument through to its logical conclusion and <span class="highlight">vote</span> for our amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members may recall that, at the last election, in the Huon I gained a higher <span class="highlight">vote</span> than I had at the previous election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I did not, I would walk across this silly floor and <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this Parliament, having had their ideas formed within their political organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have yet to see a member of  Her  Majesty’s Opposition come over and <span class="highlight">vote</span> on our side of the House except on the Family Law Bill when four members of  Her  Majesty’s Opposition came over and voted with the majority of Government members in relation to a matter of conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It requires the <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the majority of the members of the Parliament to give a paper that immunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am talking about is people making irrelevant claims about a document carrying privilege because it was presented when in fact that privilege was given by a majority <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the House in which the Premier who now complains commands a majority of votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They all readily understand why the Government has found it impossible to date to <span class="highlight">vote</span> funds for this project this time around. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know quite well that my colleague the Minister for Defence, within the broad thrust of government policy, within specific Defence Force needs and to the best of his capacity within the funds available, has sought to make sure that as much as possible of the Department of Defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> is spent on the purchase of Australian equipment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, we must realise that the Northern Territory Government received a block <span class="highlight">vote</span> of $280m with which to back up many of the responsibilities which passed to it on 1 July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt at that referendum the haves will <span class="highlight">vote</span> to ensure that the have nots have no say in the way in which Canberra is run. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet the Government has put practically $ 1.5 m onto the <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Department of the Capital Territory for computer services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not urge the people of Canberra necessarily to adopt that view in their referendum <span class="highlight">vote</span>, but it is not a bad system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Well- the pros and cons are for you to consider and very shortly to cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I want to say that there is a man who went about doing good, and the Spirit of the Lord was upon him, and his Government is the most important thing for your life and my life, and in relation to that man we must also cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>size of the Australian Labor Party <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the recent by-election is the greatest evidence of that grievance that I could possibly bring forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the area that I represented before- perhaps only the honourable member for Macarthur  (Mr Baume)  would understand the significance of this- the Labor <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the subdivision of Bradbury swung from 37.6 per cent to some 58 per cent, a swing of over 20 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal <span class="highlight">vote</span>, which in recent years has been as high as 58 per cent there, is now 26.3 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were two large booths, Airds North and Curran, where the Liberal candidate received less than nine per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liberal <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the Green Valley subdivision was 14.5 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we need to realise is that if all that area- Cabramatta and Fairfield- had been in the electorate the swing would have resulted in the highest <span class="highlight">vote</span> that has ever been recorded by the Labor Party in Werriwa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Green Valley rose from only 73 per cent to 78.9 per cent but it is rather hard to improve on an area that votes between 70 and 80 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I sincerely hope that there are some back bench members in the Government ranks in this chamber and in the Senate who will show enough care for the ordinary people who are affected by the more vicious sections of the Budget to <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Opposition when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we come to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> I will be most interested to see whether the honourable member either abstains from voting or crosses the floor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is all right for an honourable member in this Parliament to oppose Bills, but the only real test of a person’s sincerity is when he puts his <span class="highlight">vote</span> where his mouth is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable member for Denison chooses not to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against his own Government on these issues then I think he has been speaking with his tongue in his cheek or with a forked tongue, as I said before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it should be pointed out that the Opposition does not oppose all provisions of the Bills, but it has no opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span> selectively on the Bills or the provisions of the Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even seats like Eastwood and Northcott, which are in the heart of Tory land, have been retained for the Liberals by only 3,000 or 4,000 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do you know,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  that for the Liberals in South Australia to gain government- for the anti-socialists to win- they have to get 54.5 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I make the prediction that when  Mr Wran  and his colleagues, the people who run the Party from inside, the left wingers whom my colleagues the honourable member for St George, the honourable member for Dundas  (Mr Ruddock)  and the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Carlton)  repeatedly are pointing out to the people of Australia, pass their gerrymander 60 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be needed to get Wran out of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether the Bill is taken as a whole or whether that clause is dealt with separately in Committee, I will not <span class="highlight">vote</span> with the Labor Party, having been elected as a Liberal member of the Parliament, but I will leave the chamber and reduce, at least by one, the numbers on this side of the chamber who will support this clause, or Bill, as the case may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Denison is prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Government on the question of the Curran scheme to protect tax avoiders on the basis that it is contrary to Liberal Party policy, but we will see tonight whether he will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Government’s decision to reduce the means test for pensioners and on the reduction of social security and repatriation pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For those reasons I wish to make it quite clear that unlike those prisoners on the other side of the House who are just little minions and pawns I am going to exercise a conscience <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this matter, and I will not support the provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the reality nevertheless is that this is a Government which repeatedly says something in terms of its policy if there is a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in it but when it comes to the crunch it does not deliver. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What about the country <span class="highlight">vote</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not support the Government and I did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the measures last night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I explained to these ill-mannered people last night that as I am elected as a Liberal I would not <span class="highlight">vote</span> with them but that I would not support the Government and I absented myself from the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Therefore, if honourable members opposite <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this provision, then by the definition of their own leader they will be reintroducing politics into the pension field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That pledge will be broken if Government supporters <span class="highlight">vote</span> for clauses 5 and 6. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say seriously to all honourable members opposite that if they want to follow their leader and not reintroduce politics into pensions, they should <span class="highlight">vote</span> against clauses 5 and 6. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they intend to adhere to at least the understanding that pensioners had in 1977, given the series of statements made during that year by Liberal leaders, again they will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against these clauses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They walked out of the chamber when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> was taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having listened to the remarks of the honourable member, I say that it is no wonder that the pensioners, the mothers of children who earn income and the unemployed in New South Wales registered a <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Federal Government at last Saturday’s State election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was a covenant, an invitation to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for every one of the honourable gentlemen opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say quite frankly to members on the opposite side that if they now <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this provision and then come along a few weeks later to prate their concern about the unemployed, they will deserve to be treated-I believe the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend that thought to the simple souls that he now leads as a sentiment which, if it would do nothing else short of indexing the unemployment benefit I think that is the course that ought to be followed would provide some measure of economic relief to those hundreds of thousands of decent Australian citizens who want to work, who will not be able to get work and who, if we <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this legislation in this form, will be forced to live below the poverty level in Australia in 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I emphasise again that whilst, for practical purposes, no member of the Government parties was prepared to give support to the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt),  who is at the table, nearly every one of them voted for these changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that their constituents in their electorates note that before the last election and before the election in 1975 they published leaflets promising certain things but now were prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the change from six monthly indexation to yearly indexation, the re-introduction of the means test, the abolition of the maternity benefit and the reduction in the unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The shoddy drafting on that occasion forced many members of the Party against their will to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against providing that option to the private health funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we add to that cost the amount expended on education by the States, we find that the education <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the whole of Australia represents a tremendously large part of the money expended by both the Commonwealth and the State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We- and when I say ‘we’, I mean all people in this chamber who were involved, whether on government committees or standing or select committees- co-operated in getting behind the Minister to try to provide for  him  as much money as possible for the Defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781025_reps_31_hor111/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The capacity of this country to borrow large amounts on very favourable terms is testimony to the high regard in which we are held in international financial circles and a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of confidence in the policies of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is not strictly correct because the Land Fund Commission is normally regarded as being incorporated in the Enterprise <span class="highlight">vote</span> in any case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But we think that it is high time that some commitment was made whether the rather planned disaster areas floated by while so-called experts such as the turtle farming, the crocodile farming, the emu farming and the oyster project which are currently operating, should continue to eat up the funds of the Enterprise <span class="highlight">vote</span> despite the setting up of an Aboriginal controlled agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will be interested to see how many South Austraiian members- as South Australia is the State so severely affected by this measure, as it relates to brandy- will cross the floor and <span class="highlight">vote</span> with us on that part of the measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those who now challenge the Budget by suggesting that they will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against a piece of legislation flowing from the Budget- a revenue raising measure that was supported by members on this side of the House when they voted for the Budget- now say that they can take a small piece of it and say that they do not like it and therefore will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any who <span class="highlight">vote</span> against that piece of legislation invite future governments to consider the imposition upon the grape growing industry of a wine tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a South Australian, and one concerned about an industry that is very significant to South Australia, I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> in support of the Government’s legislation because I believe that that is the best and surest way to indicate the view that a government should not entertain the idea of spreading the tax burden to raise the same amount of revenue by imposing an excise on wine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although I appreciate the fact that the honourable member for Wakefield and the honourable member for Mallee  (Mr Fisher)  crossed the floor to <span class="highlight">vote</span> with us, that is not saying that we in the Labor Party were hypocritical on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I intended to say that, if, in fact, your union rules now ensure full democracy, i.e., that right of every rank and filer to have a direct <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the election for the position you now hold, then they have me to thank for it; because I amended the Act to make that requirement compulsory and you opposed those amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, I still have the telegram I received from you on 8 May 1973, calling upon me to withdraw my amendments to the Act which required that all union officers exercising powers to make or alter rules, impose fines upon members, expel members or to exercise the functions of union management, must be elected by a direct <span class="highlight">vote</span> of all of the union members likely to be affected by those decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of 197 to 163 the conference also decided to repudiate its Premier  Mr Hamer,  the  Deputy  Premier,  Mr Thompson,  the Minister for Social Welfare,  Mr Dixon,  and call for the restoration of the death penalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>64 of 1976, the Act required the rules of an organisation to provide that elections for offices in an organisation be by direct <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the rank and file membership, with a limited exception in relation to these offices of a part-time nature on the committee of management of the organisation where the rules provided for a one-tier collegiate system of election for those offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-54-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In November 1976, following discussions with the peak union and employer councils and numerous representations, the Government introduced further amendments to the Act to give organisations the choice of providing for elections for offices by direct <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the appropriate sections of the rank and file or by a defined form of collegiate voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-54-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Act allows current holders of office, from dme to time, to be members of the college which elects persons to those offices for the following term, provided those office bearers do not constitute more than IS per cent of the members of the college and were originally elected to office under a one-tier collegiate electoral system or by direct <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the appropriate section of the membership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-54-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting that they protested against these changes but did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> against them when they were debated in the House on 12 October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We came to the conclusion that it was an occasion when there should be conciliation and, far from a clash of views and possibly, too, of rancour, we thought that it would be far better if he could achieve an amicable settlement of the problem, or, if that was not possible, let debate be worked out until the closure so that there could be no <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">vote</span> was 96 against abortion and 23 in favour of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not see that sort of <span class="highlight">vote</span> tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot predict at this stage, and I do not think anybody else can predict, the outcome of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this motion, but it is not going to be 96 to 23. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The probability is that when the <span class="highlight">vote</span> is taken on this motion tomorrow night, if the debate lasts that long, it will settle the issue once and for all in favour of abortion for those who are able to qualify for an abortion in accordance with the medical laws and the common law of the various States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as on one occasion I was the loser when I took part in a similar debate which spelt the death knell to the <span class="highlight">vote</span> for or against State aid, I believe that my view will prevail on this occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor will any other fair-minded person <span class="highlight">vote</span> against those practising Catholics who <span class="highlight">vote</span> according to their conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I held the same views that they do I would <span class="highlight">vote</span> in favour of the Lusher motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be that as it may, there is here a second key question of fact which is materially significant for my own <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue, and that is: Are facilities for abortion with reasonable access in fact available at public hospitals? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say only this: A <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the motion in its original, or the amended form I have referred to, is for my part based on the presumption as to fact that adequate public hospital facilities are available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again that influences my <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I confess that in the early stages it was my intention not to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on any of the amendments or on the motion that has been moved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree and acknowledge that the amount of criticism with regard to the certification aspects of the motion will have a bearing on the <span class="highlight">vote</span> that might be taken in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You may not be aware that any legislation concerning abortion is a conscience <span class="highlight">vote</span> by the individual Members in the House of Representatives and Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When debating this legislation I am sure that my Parliamentary colleagues will consider all the factors and <span class="highlight">vote</span> accordingly, however, as I have stated above, abortion is a conscience <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Member for the Electorate of Sydney, I will certainly always <span class="highlight">vote</span> against abortion, I have in the past and will continue to strongly oppose any move to legalise abortion in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Vote</span> no. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason I have come out so seriously on an issue that is going to affect so many people in the electorate of Sydney is that for many years to come I will have to stand up and be counted because of the way I will <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a sense this situation is in defiance of a <span class="highlight">vote</span> by this House in 1973 on a Bill relating to abortion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is therefore, in my opinion, no justification for this motion and I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That submitted by the honourable member for Moore  (Mr Hyde)  is virtually identical in intent with the original motion, and therefore I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I believe it may well be too restrictive as regards the desirable legal position, and furthermore- this is perhaps the greatest concern I have- it has not had sufficient study devoted to it for one to be certain of its implications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I am prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall seek, by my <span class="highlight">vote</span>, to allow only those changes to the relevant laws which carefully control abortions and allow them merely for a short period after conception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Depending on what procedures the House follows later today when we come to the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the motion and/or the amendments before the Chair, I ask the Government not to lose sight of this proposition as one of the alternative options to be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, to me, to use a hypothetical possibility as an argument is not in itself a sufficient reason to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we as a community believe that our society would be a better and more humane society with fewer abortions, and regardless of how we as individuals <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the motion before us today, we must as a community take increased steps to lessen the number of situations arising where abortions are contemplated by the women concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like other members, I am in a quandary as to how to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the amendments which will be put this evening before the substantive motion is put, because it appears quite possible that the Lusher motion itself will not be put to the <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is, I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How I <span class="highlight">vote</span> on these latter two amendments will have to depend on how I assess the likelihood of the Lusher motion succeeding if it comes to a <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all else, my <span class="highlight">vote</span> will be cast on the basis of the fundamental importance that I attach to the life of a human being, whether he be born or as yet unborn, and to the laws of our society, not just the laws of our parliaments, relating to life and death generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Lusher motion and all the amendments except the Simon amendment, which I will support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said that the way an honourable member votes may be used against him electorally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my opinion that the members of the Australian public are too sophisticated and too intelligent to be beguiled into venting their spleen upon any member of this House at election time because of the way he votes in relation to this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a conscience <span class="highlight">vote</span> and I think that the members of the Australian public are mature enough to realise that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I suspect that on this issue the public of Australia would probably <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the motion of the honourable member for Hume. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">vote</span> that will be taken today is not a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on rich versus poor; it is a <span class="highlight">vote</span> on right versus wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today’s <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this Parliament is the first step to restoring here and now in the national Parliament some of the real values of human life, of saying to the community that we stand for those who have the rights to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each one of us is asked to exercise a <span class="highlight">vote</span> of conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I hope that we will exercise our <span class="highlight">vote</span> on this issue as legislators with a conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is to be a conscience <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ever since I became a member of Parliament I have been wondering what a conscience <span class="highlight">vote</span> is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight I may have the opportunity to prove what a conscience <span class="highlight">vote</span> is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak according to my conscience and I am going to <span class="highlight">vote</span> accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not one person in this wide world will change that <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time in six years the House of Representive is to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the question of public funding for abortion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my right, based on my religious belief, to <span class="highlight">vote</span> in support of the Lusher motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a conscience <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But tonight there is to be a conscience <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a conscience <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members will <span class="highlight">vote</span> according to their conscience they will disregard that type of thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the motion that the House is really debating and on which honourable members will <span class="highlight">vote</span> has nothing to do with the legality or otherwise of abortions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real question on which honourable members have to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, to quote the honourable member for KingsfordSmith  (Mr Lionel Bowen),  is about thirty pieces of silver. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the motion before the chair they will be saying that the termination of pregnancy that is legally performed anywhere in Australia will not entitle a patient to draw a medical benefit to help her to pay for the legal and legitimate treatment unless she is prepared to divulge the details of her personal history to non-medical bureaucrats completely unknown to her and, at the same time, her doctor is prepared to act as the tool to this destruction of confidentiality by providing very personal details of his patient to faceless bureaucrats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already the Premiers of two States have suggested to honourable members that they should <span class="highlight">vote</span> in a particular way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>State law enforcement authorities will hide behind the decision, and I can see that if honourable members do not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Lusher motion, abortions will continue in the present haphazard manner of today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appeal to members of this Parliament: If you <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Lusher motion you are opening the gates to abortion throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against those amendments that I have indicated deserve to be voted against. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I intend to <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Lusher motion and, in addressing my own electors, I adopt the words of Edmund Burke: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an utter inequality of responsibility and sacrifice so far as pregnancy is concerned, and it is extraordinary to find that there are members of an allmale parliament who say: ‘Let us <span class="highlight">vote</span> to sustain that imbalance’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the letters I have received, mostly from men demanding that I <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Lusher motion, reveal an astonishing confidence in their own judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If members on the other side were genuinely concerned about ensuring that women went on with their pregnancies and had babies, why did not some of them come over and <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Budget that took away the lousy $32 maternity allowance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the motion by the honourable member for Hume and will <span class="highlight">vote</span> accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I am concerned about all those issues, if the Baume amendment is rejected I must <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Simon amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In rising to speak in this debate, I wish to make it clear at the outset that I support the Lusher motion and, if it is necessary to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on it, I will support the Cadman amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will support the Hyde amendment and <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Cadman, Simon and other amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does, as the honourable member states, give a list of those who <span class="highlight">vote</span> for and against. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790327_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my recollection there exists nothing in the column to indicate to anybody not experienced that the tellers have actually voted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790327_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have just received a page of the  Votes and Proceedings  from the clerk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790327_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think, in looking at the list now, that it would be quite obvious really that the tellers have voted for the ayes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790327_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But certainly the page from the  Votes and Proceedings  makes it clear that the honourable gentleman did <span class="highlight">vote</span> for that amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790327_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So honourable members opposite will all have to stand up here and be counted on just how much they can be trusted in the future when they make promises to governments because they will have to <span class="highlight">vote</span> here to break promises to other governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790327_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In December last year the Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen)  said that it would be appropriated by a special <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The then honourable member for Angas, now the honourable member for Wakefield  (Mr Giles),  voted in favour of the lakeside site. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator DrakeBrockman,  myself and  Mr Luchetti,  the then honourable member for Macquarie, voted for the building to be on the hill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said This ought to be a free <span class="highlight">vote</span>’, as he did on questions of Standing Orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eventually 50 voted in favour of the hill site and 39 for the lakeside site. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Senate the votes were 42 and six respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the Senate, the votes stood at about the previous <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The majority of the people in the Parliament voted for the new building to go on Capital Hill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I found it difficult to understand how one could assert that the Parliament had no opinion; the majority of members had voted for Capital Hill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The totals of the votes were clearly for Capital Hill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be understood outside this Parliament- indeed, I think most people would agree- that the tenor of the debate last week and the <span class="highlight">vote</span> itself should not be construed by the public at large as suggesting that this Parliament condones or approves of abortion on demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not trying to hide anything; we are trying to suggest to the Australian people what our policies are 18 months before they will have the opportunity to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the crunch point is the roll call <span class="highlight">vote</span>, and it may be of interest to the House if I were to table conference documents giving details of the voting patterns on particular issues from which power groupings, in votes taken at the Conference, may be discerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the situation at the IPU is such that the Eastern bloc, the Western bloc, religious blocs, and oil blocs form these groups and <span class="highlight">vote</span> continuously as a bloc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there was a situation finally of a very close <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This had a major effect on the way they voted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know very well that the delegations from the vast majority of the countries always <span class="highlight">vote</span> unitedly because they have only a government point of view to put which is reactionary in the real sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind him that I have yet to see him cross the floor and not follow his party <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It did not even need to put the matter to a <span class="highlight">vote</span> other than on the voices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will be rejecting those amendments when the time comes to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has recently come to light, thanks partly to the endeavour of my colleague, the honourable member for Parramatta  (Mr John Brown),  that not all of the members of this Parliament have made the same commitment to serve all their electors, regardless of how they have voted or might <span class="highlight">vote</span> in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Analyses in the past have contained statistical tables showing the percentage of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> which would have been won by each political party in each proposed division at the preceding election had it been conducted on the proposed boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member may also care to note that the data included in the table relate only to the central CSIRO studentship <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I appeal to all honourable members with a conscience to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for the Opposition’s amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When he went to the highest court in Pakistan, the situation was that of a bench of seven, which originally was nine, three judges were for acquittal, three were for conviction, and the casting <span class="highlight">vote</span> of the Chief Justice went for conviction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that what is most needed on 5 May is a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to weed the Liberals out of the garden State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conference adopted resolutions which hardened still more the Left’s rigid antiuranium policy; which removed the right of State Labor members of parliament to exercise a conscience <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the matter of abortion- against the Party’s strong pro-abortion line; and which took decisions, such as banning the use of asbestos, even when no other less hazardous materials are available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have no doubt that on 5 May they will cast a <span class="highlight">vote</span> to restore honesty and integrity to the government of Victoria and return a Wilkes government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the issuing of special instructions to Presiding Officers to ensure that assistance to non-literate voters was properly given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790501_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-1-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These instructions covered the marking of ballot-papers, the use of how-to-<span class="highlight">vote</span> cards and the secrecy of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> in respect of non-literate voters; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790501_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-1-63">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the case of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly election the Australian Electoral Office believes that it is significant that there was a reduction in the informal <span class="highlight">vote</span> from S.08 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span> in 1974 to 3.18 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">vote</span> in 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790501_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-1-63">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the first instance one has to recall that the redistribution in Western Australia in 1977 produced a result which left the Australian Labor Party winning only one seat out of ten- that is 10 per cent of the seatseven though we got 39 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on a two-party preferred basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position which now exists, where the Labor Party, with nearly 39 per cent of the <span class="highlight">vote</span> on a two-party preferred basis, has only 10 per cent of the seats, indicates a substantial measure of inequity in terms of the present boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the choice that the people have to make when they <span class="highlight">vote</span> at elections in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that I do not have to spell out to honourable members the political reality of the current fight by the Aboriginal people in Western Australia for the basic right to <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am making the point about any additional benefit to a judge for service of say, less than seven years, which might be considered where an appointment has been made late in life and he cannot reach the period for which these entitlements accrue, that at a time when there is a feeling that there should be restraint in the community and at a time when this Parliament has approved annual indexation of pensions as opposed to six-monthly indexation of pensions- my position on that is well known and clearly understood because I voted against it, as I believed I was obliged to <span class="highlight">vote</span>- it might well be argued that the provision of additional benefits for the judiciary is inappropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see the first of those two areas as being the need for acceptance by both sides of the House that it is necessary for procedures in this place to be covered in such a way that the relativity of numbers between the Government and the Opposition can be maintained, with no disruption to the continued procedures of committees outside the House because of the necessity for members of those committees to come into the chamber to register their votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it is equally important that members of the public, constituents of members, who listen to the broadcasts of this House, accept that the fact that their member does not <span class="highlight">vote</span> on an issue does not mean that he is not attending to his responsibilities about the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us be quite clear about the fact that if committees assisting in the consideration of legislation are allowed to sit at the same time as this House is sitting, there is no way in which I will ever be absent from a <span class="highlight">vote</span> in this House, or be absent from the proceedings of this House, if my presence is required here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If Liberal Party and National Country Party members were prepared to <span class="highlight">vote</span> for that motion in the Senate in 1975, as it was proposed by  Senator Bonner,  a Liberal senator, then maybe we can emulate the Senate and do exactly the same thing in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it at the second reading stage and during the Committee debate the Opposition will take the opportunity - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Remaining member of the Authority, the permanent  Chairman  who casts the deciding <span class="highlight">vote</span>, is now  Mr Henry  Higgs, a munitions expert, not a marine biologist, and former principal of the Woomera Rocket Range, an engineer who, in the past, has not exhibited much support for the conservationists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The very fact that a <span class="highlight">vote</span> goes on at a certain level for year after year is not in itself an argument that that <span class="highlight">vote</span> should have to go on at that level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Presumably the Federal Government, in agreeing to a referendum on self-government, knew that there was a possibility that people would <span class="highlight">vote</span> for no change in administrative responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people <span class="highlight">vote</span> for ‘no change’ and the Minister then interprets this result as an argument in favour of such change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having been granted leave to make a short statement, I take this opportunity to remind the House and the people of Australia that the Opposition has opposed this Bill at the second reading stage and will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against it very shortly because the Opposition believes that it is part of the horror mini-Budget proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the Opposition will <span class="highlight">vote</span> against the Bill at the second reading stage and at the third reading stage as well because we believe that it is an unnecessary revenue-raising impost on the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is now, as it was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, depending on what it plans to do, claiming credit for what has already been done, and, I am sorry to say, regularly reducing the share of the gross national product which is to be allocated to the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That night, at least four Ministers voted against the then Prime Minister who said a few words afterwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Mr Speaker, the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  has provided me with a written answer to a question which I asked on Thursday of last week relating to the defence <span class="highlight">vote</span> as stated in the Budget Speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer shows that the figure given by the Treasurer was a padded figure, and not an accurate reflection of the actual <span class="highlight">vote</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs can take the credit for that and so can Government members if they do not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for this motion which would give the young people of this country some hope that there are people in this Parliament who care about their future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because they did not take unemployment seriously enough to <span class="highlight">vote</span> on the issue, they have allowed the Prime Minister to deal with it in the way in which he has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have allowed the Government to go on believing that the people of Australia will never <span class="highlight">vote</span> seriously on the issue of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That decision, as the Australian people came to learn to their cost, had absolutely nothing to do with their spirit being sapped but everything to do with their <span class="highlight">vote</span> being conned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst eventually he perished at the ballot box- that is something to be regretted by people who did not <span class="highlight">vote</span> for him then but who would like another chance- at least historians will probably regard the period of his rule, from 1972 to 1975, as one of the Camelots of Australian history; as a period when things of an egalitarian nature did happen and when a quality was returned to people so that they could expect that they would get something like a fair share of the cake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If AUS is thought to be unrepresentative, the answer is to make it more representative, to get more of our 250,000 university students to participate, to run for election, to <span class="highlight">vote</span>, to argue, and to propose new policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
