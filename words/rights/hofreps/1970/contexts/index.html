  <li>
    <p>Consideration of this matter involves die <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals as well as the national interest and 1 would not expect an easy or an early solution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What has been the outcome of the approaches to the States on the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Conventions described in his answer of 29 May 1969 (Hansard, page 2556) to my question of 20 November 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-51-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition to his assistance in actual court proceedings, the Public Solicitor advises indigenous persons generally as to their legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations and as to ways and means of enforcing their legal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Advice on common law <span class="highlight">rights</span> to sue an employer for damages is available to New Guineans from officials of the Department of Labour, District Administration offices and other Administration officers throughout the Territory all of whom would in appropriate circumstances discuss the possibility of a claim being made and the way in which it could be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-20-9">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest it is time that this House asserted its <span class="highlight">rights</span> in respect of what are called money Bills - that they must originate only in this House and that they may not be amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am convinced that, if we were to take action in a way which did not interfere with the free expression of opposition and the publication of opposition to government action, but which did prevent it being expressed with licence which interfered with the civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the majority of this country, wc would have the backing of the vast majority of Australians who, again, are disturbed by the practice which has developed of invading public places and private properly in order either to interfere with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens or to threaten and intimidate other citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amount of money which will be raised by the levy on third party and workers’ compensation insurers, as I indicated the last time I answered a question from the honourable member, would be the same amount which would be currently outlaid and which would be outlaid in any succeeding year for hospital and medical costs incurred by people covered by those schemes and drawing on those sorts of services as a result of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> under those sorts of insurance schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I felt that possibly the greatest breakthrough in this particular sphere of allowing, permitting and encouraging migrants to know about their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges as Australian workers came when  Mr Justice  Moore, in handing down a decision, said that that decision would be made available in the languages of the people who had been concerned in the dispute and who had been encouraged to come and work in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second is that we should try to make a renewed effort to see that newly arrived workers know their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities in terms of their awards and all the protections which they can call upon when they need them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Immigration the following question: In view of the fact that many thousands of nonEnglish speaking migrants make up a significant part of the Australian work force, will the Minister take steps to make available appropriate explanatory material in the relevant languages showing the <span class="highlight">rights</span> as well as the obligations of employees? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister confer with the Minister for Labour with a view to ensuring that awards and decisions of State and Australian arbitration tribunals as well as State and Australian statutes are translated and published in the appropriate languages so that all workers, irrespective of their national origin, will understand and have the capacity to enforce their <span class="highlight">rights</span> legally? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The policy of the Australian Labor Party as approved at the 29th Conference at Launceston in 1971 included the statement that ‘Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> shall carry with them full <span class="highlight">rights</span> to minerals in those lands’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question:  &lt;il) The Government will await the final report of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission before taking action to provide further land for the Gurindji at Daguragu . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We oppose this clause believing that all divisions should be capable of receiving postal votes for other divisions; that it is part of the facilities, the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and the convenience that should be allowed to citizens; that to pass this clause will again increase the postal votes which will be invalid because they cannot be included in the count; and that it will deny the opportunity to electors to have their votes recorded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a matter of concern that, given the claims, the demands, and the legitimate aspirations of the Aboriginal people for land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the Parliament should adopt a position in which it gives with one hand and tends to take away with the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As W. H. C.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that too much of the discussion by the Premiers and others proceeds on an unsupported assumption that in some undefined way the interests of the nation will be better served by a return to greater States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> and reduced Federal powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No doubt the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Beazley)  will give to me some of his high thoughts, but I would suggest to him to go out into the market place and ask the Australian people what they feel about Wilfred Burchett and his <span class="highlight">rights</span> within Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A citizen has <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges but surely he also has responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people in this country today speak about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of people but not enough people in Australia - I include many academics and clerics - speak about a person’s responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we talk too much about <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges and not enough about what goes with them we tend to weaken the fibre of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So when we talk of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of people such as Burchett we must also emphasise the responsibility of citizenship and service which they owe to the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s policy is summed up by my honourable friend the Minister for Defence and by the Prime Minister - this has consistently been the case - as being to strive for, to seek and to find those means in the world that will enable countries to have their independence, to maintain their national integrity, and to ensure that the inviolability of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> is held in honour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Defence referred to the inviolability of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and quoted the United Nations Charter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I raise this matter because, whatever we may personally think about the situation in Vietnam, I want to make it perfectly clear that we on this side of the House always have adopted the principle that while our servicemen are there we would not deny to them the benefits and <span class="highlight">rights</span> to which they are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The significant point is the very important consideration that a returned from active service badge gives to an ex-serviceman two <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its aim should be that all our citizens may enjoy the security and peace of life that stems from the knowledge that in every eventuality the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, well being and dignity of the frail, the sick and the aged will be upheld and properly safeguarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are a wide range of tools available to achieve the sort of society which we aim at achieving - an equalitarian society based upon the assumption that people have equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> and that these equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> ought to be available to all people from birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Queensland Government or the Australian Sugar Board by allowing large surpluses of cane to be destroyed - to be ploughed in at the end of this year - the Opposition would have no hesitation in seeing that this matter was raised in the United Nations because this destruction of food would infringe the basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> and principles of every civilised nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He will remember his statement on 25th September last year when he said that his Government would introduce, at the earliest practicable date, legislation to provide for the portability of superannuation <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would imagine that there is very little State <span class="highlight">rights</span> sentiment in Australia in regard to companies legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can surely be no justification for a State <span class="highlight">rights</span> attitude on companies laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first approach was through an increase in ‘unconditional’ reserve assets by activating the proposal for special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> scheme came into operation on 1st January 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this scheme, a total amount of$US9.5 billion in special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be allocated to member countries of the Fund over the next 3 years and will constitute an addition to the first-line reserves of those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second approach to the problem of increasing international liquidity has been that of increasing the ‘conditional’ reserve assets of members countries in the Fund by increasing their quotas - or ordinary drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> - with the Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Fund decisions on special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the quota review  have done much to restore confidence in currencies and to provide a favourable climate for the readjustment process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In brief, for a subscription of $US41m or$A37m, returnable in the event of the winding up of the Fund, we would obtain an increase in our fund drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> of $US41m, available automatically, and of $US165m, available in case of balance of payments need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have first-line reserves consisting of gold, foreign exchange, ‘gold tranche’ position with the Fund and special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> of around $ A 1,400m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An opposition it quite within its <span class="highlight">rights</span> to oppose - indeed, it would be failing in the exercise of its proper function as an opposition if it did not strenuously oppose with every means in its power within the Standing Orders of this Parliament - legislation with which it did not agree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not saying whether the Opposition had <span class="highlight">rights</span> or whether it did not, but last night we saw in this Parliament what we are being encouraged to see in our universities by some sections only, what we are starting to see in some of our courts by some sections only, and it is something that should concern every member of this Parliament whether he be Labor or Liberal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we look at places like Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen, Sachsenhausen and Ravensbruck and visit the memorial to these places in Jerusalem today - because it was mainly Jews who suffered - we can see the prime importance of not allowing ourselves - in certain circumstances - to be down-trodden and deprived of our <span class="highlight">rights</span> by a law, but I maintain that there is nothing in Australia today which can be remotely compared with the situation in Nazi Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth believes that, except in respect of internal water’s as they existed at federation, the States have no such <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In respect of the continental shelf, it declares and enacts that sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the shelf are vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The exercise by any state, that is to say any country, of sovereign legislative authority and proprietary <span class="highlight">rights</span> beyond its land territory is part of its international relation and is regulated by international law as well as by the domestic law of the State itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia, as a member of the United Nations, participated in the negotiations of these conventions, and in relation to other states the Commonwealth of Australia is exclusively responsible for the exercise of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and duties that the conventions embody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As between Australia and states which are not party to one or more of the conventions, their respective <span class="highlight">rights</span> and duties are of course regulated by the general or customary international law, of which indeed the conventions were in large measure declaratory, and in which also the subsequent practice of states has tended to follow and adopt the rules embodied in the 1958 conventions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of internal or domestic law, it is part of the prerogative of the Crown, in the absence of legislation, to determine the areas to which its sovereignty extends and within which it will exercise its sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The .position both under customary international law and in the 1958 convention is expressed in the current rule that the coastal state exercises over the continental shelf sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will notice that this formula does not accord to the coastal state ‘sovereignty’ in respect of the continental shelf, but only certain specified sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">rights</span>, moreover, are expressly stated in the convention not to affect the legal status of the superjacent waters as high seas; the same rule exists under customary international law, as the practice of states at present stands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How far out, and down, the coastal state’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> should be recognised as extending has not so far been resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Bill is concerned rather with the internal or domestic question whether Australia’s internationally recognised <span class="highlight">rights</span>, whatever their extent is or may become are exercisable by the Commonwealth or by the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then a year ago, in an address to the Australian Conservation Foundation,  Sir Percy  Spender, Q.C., a distinguished former Commonwealth Minister and member of this House who later became  President  of the International Court of Justice, expressed the view that the off-shore <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Commonwealth under the Australian Constitution were as complete and as exclusive of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States as those established by the Supreme Court of Canada as belonging there to the Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I should mention also that in August 1969, in the case of Bonser v. La Macchia the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia and  Mr Justice  Windeyer look occasion to state their considered opinion on the respective off-shore <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>at some time before the adoption of the 1958 conventions on the Territorial Sea and the Continental Shelf, Australia had become an independent nation state, and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> recognised by those conventions accrued in their entirety to the Commonwealth of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill asserts what the Government believes to be the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Commonwealth, broadly in accordance with the judicial views I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, in the formula customarily used where an Act is regarded as stating the law as it already exists, as well as possibly making new law, the Bill declares and enacts that the sovereignty in the territorial sea is vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth - this is in clause 5; similarly that the sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australia for the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the continental shelf are vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth - this is in clause 10; and that sovereignty in the internal waters of Australia, with the important exception of waters that were internal waters of the States at the time of federation, and still remain such, is likewise vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth - this is in clauses 9 and 11, which must be read together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, the saving provisions of the Bill ensure that the establishment of the sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Commonwealth in off-shore areas will not impair existing State ownership and control of wharves and other port facilities, and will not create anything in the way of an automatic legal vacuum, especially in the territorial sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members o the Opposition have some <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and they should have available to them the services of a trained legal officer to put these complicated matters into proper legal form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I almost get sick and tired of saying this, but the Commonwealth has no <span class="highlight">rights</span> at all in imposing production controls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where we see Communism in action we see the destruction of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of human beings as individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am reminded of a story told of the American film producer Samuel Goldwyn who was at one time endeavouring to persuade George Bernard Shaw to hand over the film <span class="highlight">rights</span> to some of Shaw’s plays. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not want a remote bureaucracy making some sort of vague assessment and giving some sort of vaguely worded decision on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a person within the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As K found in all of Kafka’s writings, he was shuttled from minor official to minor official, always skirmishing on the periphery but never really quite reaching the heart of where the decisions were made, never quite reaching where he should be entitled to reach as a citizen within a democratic society, to put his case for his <span class="highlight">rights</span> within a society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where they are rejected there ought to be a tribunal to which these people can make a public appeal, so that they can exercise democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span>, otherwise the expression is an empty slogan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present the various State governments are accepting the grants on these conditions but if the Victorian people elected a government which had the policy reported as being that of the State executive of the Australian Labor Party against State aid it would be within its <span class="highlight">rights</span> to refuse to accept the grants! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that that practical interpretation in the minds of many of the leaders of this so-called moratorium is not that it should merely be a gathering to express beliefs or to express desires in a peaceful way without infringing the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of others because if that were all it was then every member of this Parliament ought to defend that right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But rather it is an intention to have gatherings to go beyond exercising that right and to infringe upon the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of others, and to sit down in the streets and to bring to bear the wish to break a law because they dislike something which a government has done after being elected by a majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again, the Labor Party’s scheme in no way interferes with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the private practitioner or of the patient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The primary reason for the substantial period of lime taken to finalise the Land Kent and Rates (Deferment) Ordinance was the solution of a number of complex legal and technical problems involving the protection of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of anyone associated with the subject land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-33-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us just create all the conditions of violence, all the emotional stirring up, and all the means whereby there will be a reaction by the people against the usurpation of their <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and if there is any violence blame the police and call them Fascist pigs.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our young people are being prodded into situations where their emotions will be aroused, where violence must ensue, and where there is inevitably a clash with law and order or with ordinary decent citizens who do not want to see their <span class="highlight">rights</span> usurped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a deliberate attempt to interfere with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of many citizens who only want to go about their own business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To dress this up as a blatant infringement of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the lower income members of the populace is to draw a red herring across the trail and certainly is not a significant criticism of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That offer was that the States should retain control of the mineral resources of the territorial seabed, that is, from low water mark to the 3-mile mark off-shore, while the Commonwealth legislated to take over total <span class="highlight">rights</span> outside the 3-mile limit to the edge of the continental shelf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Commonwealth takes the attitude that the States have no <span class="highlight">rights</span> because the agreement, undertaking - call it what you like - is not legally enforceable, what the Commonwealth is saying is that if the Commonwealth promises something get it written into a contract immediately, and in an enforceable form, otherwise the promise is not worth anything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not believe that the individual has a right to interfere with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other people when demonstrating those beliefs nor to break the law in so doing nor to lead to actions of violence by refusing to accept that they are breaking the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are 2 quite distinct things but the honourable member can be quite sure that, insofar as peaceful expressions of opinion which do not interfere with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other citizens are concerned, the Government is concerned to support them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was no mention of Melbourne or Melbourne streets or any other particular locality, but whether one approved of freedom of association, and the answer I gave I will now have pleasure in repeating: That we do approve of that, that we do believe that ought to be supported by ali members of Parliament, and we equally believe that when the false claim is made that there is a right for people to associate to interfere with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other citizens or to break the law then every member of Parliament ought to resist that, and these are the principles to which I gave an answer on a question of principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the problem confronting this Government - it should be a problem of all governments and all members of Parliament - is to balance the freedom of the individual with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual and the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As Ministers of his Government, especially the Minister for External Affairs, have been enunciating passionate concern for the welfare and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people in other countries, will he extend this with some consistency by now publicly condemning and denouncing the treatment of these political prisoners in Greece? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As early as the meeting of March last year the then Minister for National Development did make it clear that the Commonwealth proposed legislation on offshore mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span> beyond the 3-mile limit and that such legislation would not follow the lines of the off-shore petroleum legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whatever the honourable member might have said subsequently - and I will come to that later - 1 find it impossible to read into this statement a commitment on behalf of the Federal Government to hold prior consultations with the States on the subject of respective legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order that this may happen, my Government will ask the Parliament to pass legislation to assert and establish what the Commonwealth concedes to be its legal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The essence of the matter is as follows: In February 1969 Cabinet made a very clear decision that the Commonwealth would legislate to assert total <span class="highlight">rights</span> over the sea bed outside the 3-mile limit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That offer was that the States should retain control of the mineral resources of the territorial seabed, that is, from low water mark to the 3- mile mark off-shore, while the Commonwealth legislated to take over total <span class="highlight">rights</span> outside the 3- mile limit to the edge of the continental shelf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The decision was that the Commonwealth had sole sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> in respect of all the resources of the continental shelf right out from low water level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the States make their challenge, the sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Commonwealth undoubtedly will be upheld. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill contains two proposed provisions directed to that end: Proposed new section 88c, which is intended to preserve the value of paid order cheques as evident of receipt of the amount of the cheque, and proposed new section 88b, which is intended to preserve the <span class="highlight">rights</span> that a collecting banker now has as a holder for value under section 32 in respect of indorsed order cheques. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of new section 88e is to ensure that a collecting banker who at the present time has the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a holder for value in respect of an indorsed cheque will not be prejudiced by the proposed change in the law to do away with the necessity for indorsement on cheques payable to order that are paid into the payee’s account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order that a collecting banker will continue to have the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a holder for value in respect of cheques that will not in future be indorsed because they will be collected for the payee, new section 88e provides that the banker will have the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a holder that he would have had if the payee had indorsed it in blank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By adopting the special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span>, which are sometimes blithely described as paper gold as 1 have said, we have accepted the fact that there can be international creation of credit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I understand it, the difficulty with the SDR system - that is, the special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> system - or the paper gold system, was experienced in providing the greatest potential credit availability not to those who needed it most but to those who needed it least. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that my colleagues were just as surprised as I was to find that this preliminary essay in terms of the special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> was much more adventurous than was initially thought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although my friend, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie  (Mr Collard),  is not present I think I must say that the ominous signs are that if special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> become more extensive - personally T hope they will because it simply shows the extension on the international plane of what is done in internal banking - gold will become a less and less important element in terms of international trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The immediate effect of the special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> scheme has lo a small if imponderable extent been undermined by the agreement on South African gold sales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Commonwealth governments in the development of Australia’s water resources, I believe he should have gone on to say that th s Bill represented a significant move towards maintaining the sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States and the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The best measure of true civilisation is the standard of social care of the citizens and, perhaps above all else, the manner whereby the community cares for those who, least of all, can maintain their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and make their claim valid - the mentally ill and deficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The overall need is that the mentally handicapped person should be regarded as an individual personality having the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> as other Australians and, through his lifetime disability, having greater need of specialised assistance than more gifted citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The thing that bothers me most is that nobody in Australia is settling down to look at the whole field of handicapped children, let alone the whole field of general welfare, and asking: ‘What are <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people that we should be looking after? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What might be called the enlightened - if that is the word - movement is towards making pensions more portable and for individuals to be able to carry their <span class="highlight">rights</span> from job to job during their working lives and either collect benefits in separate funds which are actually assessed and which will support them eventually in their old age, or to move from one pension fund to another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before the last meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General it became borne in upon me that any reduction by legislation of the age of legal responsibility in any field of activity - for instance, the field of contractual activity or the field of proprietary <span class="highlight">rights</span> - would give rise inevitably to pressures for similar action in other fields in which the Commonwealth Government has a vital interest, for example, the voting age, the operation of industrial awards with the consequential effect of such operation on the economy, and the age for marrying without parental consent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the Government’s view that the Cabinet or the Government will be better able to reach a decision which, as I have mentioned and as I wish to emphasise, will have far reaching consequences not only politically but in the field of proprietary <span class="highlight">rights</span> and contractual <span class="highlight">rights</span> and in relation to marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Everything else - the question of proprietary <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of inheritance and other matters that have been detailed by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  are ancillary to it and a positive and firm lead is necessary, particularly when there is a growing climate of public opinion in support of the long overdue change of the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think costs should not have been permitted by the Government when it was amending the Act, because when costs are permitted against parties appearing before the court they are very often greater than the fines and, indeed, the costs can be a deterrent against a unionist seeking his lawful <span class="highlight">rights</span> under the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I appeal to the Attorney-General  (Mr Hughes)  to apply to the industrial area some of the civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> principles that I often hear him enunciate, and see whether for once we cannot set up a standard for the rest of the world to look at in this area, instead of getting out the knout, the whip or the sanction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I read in one or more of the Australian newspapers that  Mr Vrettos  had been placed in custody by the Greek police I immediately instructed officers of the Department of External Affairs in Athens to make inquiries with the Athens police and  Mr Vrettos  personally in order to ensure that his maximum <span class="highlight">rights</span> as an Australian were protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was then given a member in this chamber who had the same voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> as the member for the Northern Territory had at that time - that is, he could vote only on a motion to disallow an ordinance affecting the ACI’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Again in 1968 - the year I moved this Bill the first time - petitions were received and read by the Senate, firstly on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> seeking that the Parliament should make legal provision for certain land ownership and development <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aboriginals living on reserves; secondly on the lack of medical facilities and qualified medical practitioners for Groote Eylandt; and thirdly, for an inquiry into the cost of living in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is clear; it admits that there is a member for the Northern Territory in the House of Representatives and that he ought to have full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the representatives of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What it suggests is not that the Australian Labor Party will make sure that there are Senate representatives for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory but that if there are Senate representatives for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory they ought to have full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not only a House of review, as it has often been termed, but also a chamber in which the States, as separate entities, are endowed with a parity of representation designed to enable them at the legislative stage to protect those <span class="highlight">rights</span> reserved for the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have indicated already, the functions of the Senate are basically of a dual nature - firstly, as a House of revision and review in general legislation matters and, secondly, as a guardian of the interests and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternatively, the Parliament may, of course, under the provisions of section 122 allow Territory representation in the Senate by senators with full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> but the number of such representatives is wholly within the discretion of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that situation eventuated it might be claimed that the concept of the Senate as a House of review and guardian of the States <span class="highlight">rights</span> had been thwarted, to some extent at least. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will know that State <span class="highlight">rights</span> provided by the Constitution have always been carefully preserved by each of the 6 States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not unreal to say that the member for the Northern Territory was given full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> only when that member came from a party more acceptable to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I remember the figures correctly it was not until the Australian Capital Territory had an enrolment of almost 50,000 that the member for the Australian Capital Territory was given full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but with the change to Country Party membership the Northern Territory was given full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> when that Territory’s population reached 17,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Looking ahead, this could mean that we face the prospect of a retreat into trade blocs, with snowballing restrictions on trade, with clear economic loss to every country in the long run, with the little nations no longer able to look to the rule of law to obtain their trade <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we should seek to ensure that the contractual <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other countries to fair treatment are recognised and the principles of trade liberalism survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are balanced by certain contractual <span class="highlight">rights</span> that are required by their membership. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, any stand Australia takes must be on the ground of impairment or threatened impairment of our <span class="highlight">rights</span> under GATT. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 believe our <span class="highlight">rights</span> have already been impaired by the policies of the EEC in respect of both predatory dumping and the proliferation of special preferential deals with many other countries not really part of the Common Market or members of its customs union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Furthermore, our <span class="highlight">rights</span> are threatened with even more serious impairment from the likely terms and conditions of the proposed enlargement of the Common Market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is this that has brought me to the conclusions which I most strongly hold: Only by a confrontation in GATT where we and other third countries similarly affected have clear <span class="highlight">rights</span> could there be any chance of getting such modifications of the Common Agricultural Policy and other practices as would preserve fair trading opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To call the national strike apparently without even getting a resolution passed by the Australian Council of Trade Unions saying there should be a national strike unquestionably shows an approach to a Government of this country and to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens in this country which rides completely roughshod over the concept of elected members of the public coming to this House and deciding economic and other policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Answering the last part of the honourable member’s question first, no, he cannot look forward to an early announcement that the Gurindji people will be granted land, because it is not Government policy to recognise traditional land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If such a business is practicable will he consider making land available not on the principle of traditional land <span class="highlight">rights</span> but to facilitate the setting up of an Aboriginal enterprise for a community which already exists? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The strange thing is that this sensitivity to State <span class="highlight">rights</span> does not appear to hinder us in our contributions to the rural community, very many of which are provided in areas of exclusive State powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The law and order specialists on the Government side, under another name, are the people who believe in suppression of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual, suppression of the right to dissent and the gaoling of people who do not agree with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not for one moment deny the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the rural community in the predicament in which the Government has placed it, but I point out that the rural community by and large has seen fit to support the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition’s amendment and attack on the Budget lacks credibility mainly because its policies can survive and thrive only in economic and industrial disaster, and in the socialisation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and aspiration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the reason why moves have been made at all levels - in this Government, in State governments and at international level - to preserve some of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again, wherever <span class="highlight">rights</span> and sovereignty exist, there will also be duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>what sort of medical attention he shall have, what sort of education he shall have and so on are curtailed - and rightfully so - by the laws which safeguard the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a need for the community at large to be more concerned about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> within the family group without trespassing on the sovereignty of the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, there is a requirement in this country - and I am sure the people agree - for clarification as to how far people can break or abuse the law and abuse the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other people by preventing them from going about their affairs or by creating incidents so that industry and business or private matters cannot be conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My belief is that the Wattie Creek issue has attracted a great deal of support from people who feel, quite genuinely, that a great injustice has been done to the Aboriginal people by dispossession of their forebears when Australia was settled from Europe, and there is great attraction in proposals to recognise so-called traditional land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, or to set up a compensation fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Aboriginal, dispossessed and deprived, finds the great virtues of the free enterprise society - greed and selfishness - oppressing him more and more and denying him fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span>, destroying his self respect and defiling his culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Re-settlement in gigantic blocks of impersonal depersonalising flats or by people being cast indiscriminately into some distant, sprawling, soulless and unattractive housing development only gives sharpness to the edge of my criticism that people are not accorded the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and respect to which they should have an unalienable entitlement as human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The latest instance I have in mind is the recent visit by the national director of the notoriously reactionary and anti-Semitic League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>,  Mr Eric  Butler. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I thought this was a rather odd consensus coming from members of the Australian Labor Party who are supposed to champion the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the working class. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would have thought that from the self-confessed champions of the working class, the beer drinkers, that at least some mention would have been made of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the beer drinker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it also a fact that public servants in the Territory are now obliged to determine their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations from a circular from (a) the Public Service Board (1970), (b) the Public Service Commissioner (1963) and (c) the Administrator (1970). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-38-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have stated - the Prime Minister has recently confirmed this and I now confirm it again-that of course we would like Red China to be in the United Nations provided only that it accepted the Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> and abided by it and provided it was willing to abide by the principles of the Charter itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But to summarise, these are our objections: Firstly,, that the aim of the Government in this is to minimise taxation; secondly, that there may be a dichotomy of interests between the equity shareholder, the person who has borne the brunt of the battle, has run the risk and is entitled to the legitimate rewards; thirdly, that the fixed interest holder ought properly to get priority only for his interest and his capital - he should have no proprietary <span class="highlight">rights</span>; fourthly, there is the absorption, as I suggested, of the original company and the transferability of option <span class="highlight">rights</span> to another associate company; fifthly, there is the danger of the high gearing of borrowings to capital, and high gearing is a besetting evil today in company operation and in company manipulation; sixthly, there is the inflow of overseas capital which can only provoke further ultimate control of Australian assets; seventhly, the favourable terms and the flexible rates of interest which are to be made available to overseas lenders; eighthly, the competition of rich overseas companies with Australian firms on the local capital market; and ninthly, better use can be made of deferred dividend shares. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are the people ; the ordinary working people ; to be denied their <span class="highlight">rights</span> because there is no form of price control for the benefit of the consumer today although there is rampant negative price control in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yesterday in this House we heard Opposition speakers talk about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of conscientious objectors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not intend to argue the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or the wrongs of the case put by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How hypocritical does it make the cries of the Opposition for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of conscientious objectors against particular laws when they raise no cry of protest for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of conscientious objectors to joining a union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The individual has <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and in a world increasingly indifferent to liberty and individualism, a man’s remaining <span class="highlight">rights</span> must be respected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the name of morality they do not have the right to go around Australia saying that they are the upholders of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where were the Liberal Party’s fine, upstanding principles on individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> on that occasion? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, our policy is based upon and has always been based upon the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the countries of the whole of South East Asia to determine their own future and to ensure that they have the right of electing their own governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many <span class="highlight">rights</span> for all citizens of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So for all these reasons the Government completely and absolutely rejects this further attempt by the Opposition to ride roughshod over the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities of the States by imposing on them priorities which they themselves do not share. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a statement to the House on 25th September 1969 the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  outlined the Government’s proposals for the preservation of superannuation <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s intention is to remove that barrier from Commonwealth schemes so that Commonwealth employees who have spent a considerable part of their working lives in one field of endeavour and who could contribute much more to the community and to their own lives in some other area of Commonwealth, State, university or private employment will no longer feel compelled, by the fear of the loss of thenaccumulated superannuation <span class="highlight">rights</span>, to remain in their employment waiting only for the effluxion of time and the arrival of their date of retirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rules of other Commonwealth schemes will also be amended to provide for the preservation of superannuation <span class="highlight">rights</span> in general accord with the provisions of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, an employee who moves to public employment with the States, including State universities, within  3  months of ceasing his Commonwealth employment, will be able to preserve his superannuation <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally, preservation of superannuation <span class="highlight">rights</span> under the Superannuation Act will be effected by means of transfer values or deferred benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turning now to inwards preservation, on becoming a contributor a person will have the right to choose to pay to the Superannuation Board any preserved superannuation <span class="highlight">rights</span> received from his previous employment, including private sector employment, and to obtain credit in the Superannuation Fund or the Provident Account for the amount paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this way the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the employee himself, as well as those of continuing contributors to each scheme, will be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>J should mention that, the opportunity has been taken to remedy defects that have been found in sections 52 and 88 of the principal Act that relate to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of an employee who resigns to contest a parliamentary election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Prime Minister said in his statement last year, the Government believes that the arrangements now being made for preservation of superannuation <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Commonwealth schemes mark an important step forward in the development of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill is a companion measure to the Superannuation Bill 1970 that I have just introduced and amends the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948-1970 lo give effect to the Government’s proposals for the preservation of superannuation <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ideally in a democracy information concerning the activities of Government and policy decisions should be open to all so that the people can know the changing nature of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges as decided by their elected representatives, so that an informed and adequate public debate can take place on policy issues and so that checks and balances are available on the activities of governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst one would hesitate to interfere with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of commercial television channels to decide what types of programmes they wish to present, how much they should spend on the programmes and where they should acquire the programmes, I believe that there is a good case to be made for the proposition that Australian television stations should present a balanced total programme which not only presents material portraying the life, customs and cultural mores of other countries, but which also presents material which reflects similar aspects of Australia’s national ethos. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable gentleman will have noticed the high proportion of migrants among the dead and injured, and I trust he will recall that I have had 3 questions on the notice paper, one for more than 6 months - longer than all but 9 of the questions still on notice for him from the honourable member for Hindmarsh - about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of overseas dependants of workers killed or injured in industrial accidents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I want to put to the House is that all the questions that are being asked here by members of the Opposition seem to indicate that they have no regard for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people of the countries to determine their own future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for External Affairs whether Australia’s representatives at the United Nations are continuing to express our concern for the millions of people in Europe and elsewhere, who, through ruthless and oppressive Communist action, have been deprived of their basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> completely against the principles of the United Nations Charter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is one reservation to this rule and that is where oppression or the suppression of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> is continuous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To indicate our point of view, at the anniversary meeting of the General Assembly on the 24th of next month - it is a special meeting - a declaration will be made relating to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals, particularly the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of minorities in certain countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Until recently the Minister for Social Services who is, under the Prime Minister, the Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs, was regarded as the Government spokesman in matters of this kind, but on 3rd September the Minister for the Interior made a statement in this place that the Government would not recognise traditional Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the recent legislation dealt with in the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory, which will enable Aboriginals to obtain a title to land in the Aboriginal reserves, is not a recognition of traditional land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, what is it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the statement made by the Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs about the sacred objects and sites of the Aboriginals at Wingellina in Western Australia, in which he expressed his concern that these places should not be despoiled and damaged by the mining company or other developments there, was not a recognition of traditional land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, what was it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to see the Minister indicate an attitude on Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>; the recognition of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aboriginals who live in a traditional way; the recognition of communities of people as at Wattie Creek and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> that they have, because they are communities of people and have retained a good deal of their tribal integrity; a measure of compensation for land <span class="highlight">rights</span> which would be spelt out with legislation which has already been introduced into this Parliament and which will shortly again be discussed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the Parliament believe in the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States, and we would not be a party to the kind of suggestion made by the honourable member for Kingston. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am particularly astonished that this Minister, in spite of his record in this House as a libertarian, as a champion of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual and as an opponent of every form of authoritarianism, now should so roundly say that he is opposed to giving the pensioner the right of appeal against departmental decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is particularly sad when the Minister, prior to his promotion to the feather bed of high office, was himself so determined in his onslaught on any vestige of encouragement to this dictatorial rule and on any infringement of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 would never have thought that I should have to remind this Minister that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance and that part of that vigilance must be to establish and maintain - not favours to citizens, subject to politicians and officials - but the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens and the equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all citizens - not a division into first class citizens on the one hand and pensioners as second class citizens on the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senior citizens are entitled to equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> with all other citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pensioners are not to be regarded as second class citizens for whom Big Brother always knows best and who must meekly accept the orders and decisions of politicians and officials who, as the Minister suggests - and I think he says it quite wrongly - will use their discretion, not apply the law but use their discretion either for or against the senior citizen, the pensioner, dealing with him by whim or by grace instead of in accord with the pensioner’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> under the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basis of the Minister’s argument would mean the destruction of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of appeal which every taxpayer has against a decision of the Taxation Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pensioner seeks his <span class="highlight">rights</span> as a human being, as one who has worked and paid taxes, as one who requires justice under the law rather than the exercise of official discretions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government believes in law anil order, surely once a law has been ruled to be invalid there is no obligation on people to obey it and they are within their constitutional <span class="highlight">rights</span> in not paying the tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would assert that all State governments of any political colour have certain <span class="highlight">rights</span> to endeavour to raise revenue by implementing perhaps new avenues for doing so, and to endeavour to budget for it despite all the doubt that surrounds implementation and innovation in a new field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a party which, particularly in financial matters, is completely devoted to the abolition and the denigration of States <span class="highlight">rights</span> altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We ought to be telling them that they have full <span class="highlight">rights</span> of tenancy unless they become unsuitable as tenants; unless their behaviour or health makes them incompatible with the best interests of the other people who live in the aged persons home or village. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It imposes on the Parliamentary Counsel the most exacting intellectual requirements to put down on a piece of paper something which is going to establish <span class="highlight">rights</span>, to establish policy and something which will, it is the Government’s belief, make a tremendous contribution to the present difficulties of this industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My experience of 15 years of the Commonwealth Government and watching it at close quarters - disapproving of most of its politics but respecting the administrative capacity and competence of the country - is that it is only when we turn all these skills to this problem and put aside enough financial resources that we will bring forward the material advancement of the Aboriginal people of Australia in the way in which we have been able to advance most, but not all, of their legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> over the last 10 or 12 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I conclude on this note: I know that the Government wants to move on to other business, but on the question of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> I am most critical of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have already said in this House before that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of State governments - in fact the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of any government - are secondary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For that matter the Commonwealth Government did not worry about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States when it tried to legislate earlier this year on off-shore minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as the constitutional powers or <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Commonwealth to act in such cases is concerned, I say that no doubt exists because nearly all shipping in Australian waters is engaged in trade and commerce with other countries and among the States and therefore can be made subject to Commonwealth laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, one of the first things that the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  said when he was elected to office was that he would pay regard to and add to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has immediately cut down on question time, which is one of the few <span class="highlight">rights</span> that private members have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the only way to protect the - <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a private member is to incorporate in the Standing Orders a period of 45 minutes for question time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet he talks about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of private members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet he has the temerity to come into the chamber and talk about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of private members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to the seconder of the motion, the honourable member for Riverina, who spoke more on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of private members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All people have equal democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> and they should be treated accordingly in electoral redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat: No person can show contempt for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of one member of the Parliament without at the same time heaping contempt upon the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of every member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, it is equally correct to say that parliamentary <span class="highlight">rights</span> are inseverable from the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the whole of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think he was quite within his <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they had been able to continue in their occupation without prejudice to their entit lements as pensioners or their <span class="highlight">rights</span> in any other way, or without being sacked simply because they had reached the age of retirement, they would have led a fruitful life for much longer and would have continued to contribute to society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>First, surely a man who wants to go out and work without losing his pension <span class="highlight">rights</span> should be allowed to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will preface my remarks by quoting for the benefit and knowledge of the honourable member for Angas Article 25 of the Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are numerous ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen who are receiving their full pension entitlement but who certainly are not abusing their <span class="highlight">rights</span> as this man suggests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710402_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole meaning and purpose of the Liberal phoney war over States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> is to protect private affluence and perpetuate public squalor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made all sorts of centralist proposals that would really rob the States of their sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but at the same time he failed to acknowledge that there is currently, and has been for a considerable time, very extensive consultation between the States and the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So we can only conclude - of course it is well known - that Labor favours a centralist system of government and that it does not favour a federal system under which the States have their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We must remember that under our Constitution the States have sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> and are responsible for certain functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>States have certain constitutional powers and <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Worker participation in the fruits of expansion are recognised as a right and certain tax concessions and social concessions are available to the companies for their participation which does not interfere in the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of management in the decisions of development of the company involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>we would have the backing of the vast majority of Australians who, again, are disturbed by the practice which has developed of invading public places and private property in order either to interfere with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens or to threaten and intimidate other citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To shore up his case and to make it appear that this was a landmark in civil liberties and was establishing the right of dissent, the last Attorney-General cited the Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1967 General Assembly designated 1971 as Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia and other members of the United Nations were urged to ratify the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span> of 1966 as part of their contribution to Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the last Attorney-General was wanting to make out a case for legislation establishing the right of dissent and freedom of expression for this country his case would have been immeasurably strengthened if he had been able to quote not merely the Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> of 1948 but this more recent Convention of 1966 which Australia has still not ratified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt might be salutary for honourable members to see how diligent Liberal governments have been in recognising and asserting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of missions in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is as important for the future of our democracy to safeguard the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of minorities to dissent as it is to safeguard the majority against the excesses of the dissenters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the few anti-democratic violent minorities get away with it, then the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all legitimate dissenting minorities are endangered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is ail very well - everyone must applaud the sentiments that he uttered - to say that the task of the law maker is to strike a balance between the preservation of important fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the abuse of them, but the exercising of these <span class="highlight">rights</span> does sometimes produce conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am thinking particularly of countries which have a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, such as the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is written into the Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in the United States of America that one can do this, that and the other and that he has <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this pamphlet he discusses <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the law as they stand at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Justice  Hope describes that law and describes how traffic offences are used, and the question of <span class="highlight">rights</span> in respect of the distribution of leaflets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is a constitutional guarantee along the lines of the Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, or the American <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest that this restatement should be of two kinds, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> involved should be stated pos/lively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> being so stated, the restrictions, if any, with which those <span class="highlight">rights</span> are to be qualified, and the enforcement of those restrictions, should be carefully considered and the right should not be whittled down further than is absolutely necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a democracy there is a rather fine balance always to be drawn between public order on the one hand and the personal <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens on the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I submit that it is also of fundamental importance that this right of dissent be expressed or exercised in such a way as not to interfere with the legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe that the vast majority of Australians are peaceful, law abiding people who have regard for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that the use of the term ‘civil liberties’ also connotes civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> on the part of other persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said before, those people, particularly among the younger generation, who use the term sometimes for incitement and who demonstrate for what they call ‘civil liberties’ are overlooking the fact that due consideration must always be given to civil duties and obligations as well as to civil <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reference was made by the previous Attorney-General in his very fine second reading speech to the Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in the exercise of his <span class="highlight">rights</span> everyone shall bc subject to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing recognition nf the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of others and of meeting the requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent times there have been instances of demonstrations involving unreasonable obstruction and therefore an interference with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other people, if this Bill is passed, as I believe it will be, such obstruction infringing the lawful <span class="highlight">rights</span> of others will be treated as a summary offence, punishable by’ a fine of $250, 3 months gaol, or both. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is always a danger that safeguards imposed to curb excesses can go loo far, and interfere with the reasonable <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this is no reason why the community should sit by and accept the violent contempt of the law which is increasingly threatening public and private properly and citizens’ <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill before us takes away a little of what <span class="highlight">rights</span> existed before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a pretence of the former Attorney-General that one of the purposes of the Bill was to define <span class="highlight">rights</span> a little more clearly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no way does it enlarge or protect any <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is always assumed by governments like the McMahon Government to be disorder or subversion although all the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, privileges, living standards and money that most Government supporters enjoy have been won in the past by other people, by earlier generations, with precisely this kind of action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some countries, unlike the common law countries of which we pride ourselves to be one, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of free speech and assembly are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the slender thread upon which the inalienable <span class="highlight">rights</span> to free speech and assembly hang in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will certainly do everything to maintain the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals to go about their business unmolested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to say a few words about the complicated laws which exist in Australia at present and the difficulties encountered by individuals in endeavouring to understand them and exercise ‘ their own <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must look at the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of democracy in America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has never had enough courage to suggest there should be a referendum on this issue at which these young men would have a chance to exercise their <span class="highlight">rights</span>, particularly if the voting age was reduced to 18. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should look at young men as young men and look at their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the point of view of the Opposition we are particularly concerned about people demonstrating for their democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> in respect of legislation for which there is no mandate, particularly from the trade union movement when demonstrating against injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Coming back to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people, they agitate en masse and ask questions as a group of perhaps 20 or 50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is a weak government, lt is afraid of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have no real interests in their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these things which place policemen in impossible positions - deciding whether it is a lawful occasion, whether it is likely to cause apprehension and dismay in the ranks of the community or not - are not the kind of <span class="highlight">rights</span> we ought to give policemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I particularly will reject for myself and in any way I can those provisions of it which place upon the lower courts powers of imprisonment, which I do not think they ought to have, and which place in the hands of officials, whether it be the Attorney-General, a police sergeant or someone else, the right to decide whether a case will proceed or not and the right to decide on some of our fundamental and absolutely inalienable democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Calls in support of the right to dissent must be heeded, but they must not  be allowed to  deteriorate into attacks upon the proper <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I doubt whether there is any member of this House who would not agree that one of the fundamental democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> is that of dissent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>“Liberal philosophy and practice accent the individual, his <span class="highlight">rights</span> or her differences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I certainly object the moment they transgress the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals who want to move about and go about their normal business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nonetheless, he did make the reasonable point that minority <span class="highlight">rights</span> must be defended in a democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This means that if landing and uplift <span class="highlight">rights</span> are not available these persons will simply travel on charter flights to different destinations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I just want to say in passing to the honourable member for Angas  (Mr Giles)  that with the pressure of questions in the House a member asks one question every 3 weeks - this matter has been debated in the House recently - and questions on notice are an integral part of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the imprisonment of those women for 14 days for a trivial, insignificant offence, as far as I could discover - and nothing that the Minister has said today in any way contradicts that - I decided that from the point of view of civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> and civil liberties this was going too far. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A person who is killed on the road has little interest in the fact that he has been able to safeguard States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This motion is typical of Labor Party philosophy to centralise everything in Canberra and ignore the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But Opposition members say that the law already covers the offences created by the Bill, that the Bill is repressive and imposes restrictions on individual liberty that are quite unwarranted and that it attempts to prevent people from exercising their basic <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of imagining what the Bill says and fulminating against it, they should read the clauses of the Bill, read the limitations that it does impose on conduct that should be condemned and practices that should be penalised and read the qualifications and the exemptions that are written into the Bill to protect people charged with offences under the Bill, and they will see that the Bill is not restrictive or oppressive and that it does not impose unjustified limitations on the exercise of people’s liberties and <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  chided the Government with some force for not having ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, and he said that this was certainly something that the Australian Government should do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Covenant is one of 2 Covenants, the other being the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only use that has been made of this Act has been to limit the democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of our public servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Speaking about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of public servants the honourable member for Parramatta  (Mr N. H.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Bill of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> is in truth a statement of political slogans,  or  political principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can the people of Australia accept the sincerity of this Government, a government opposed to any explicit definition of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of our people; a government committed to perpetuating all the inadequacies of our Constitution; a government that has done nothing to combat our rising crime rate; a government that is utterly unconcerned about our appalling road toll, a government that plays confidence tricks on our pensioners; a government that blames everybody but itself for the plight of rural Australia; a government that has shown itself not only to be opposed to law reform but also to have no hesitation in using both the law and the Public Service for its own political advantage? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government, like its former AttorneyGeneral, is opposed to any explicit definition of basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> because such a definition would place limits on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The primary purpose of this Bill is to modernise and make uniform, so far as concerns the mailand Territories of the Commonwealth and the premises of the Commonwealth wherever in Australia they may be, the law which protects the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the public against disorderly assemblies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Resort to disorderly assemblies and demonstrations, often in deliberate disregard of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of others, has made it necessary for this Parliament to review, so far as its own powers extend, the existing law of public order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the <span class="highlight">rights</span> we enjoy in a free society must be exercised with proper respect for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It allows people who wish to break the law to understand exactly what is front of them so that they cannot claim that they acted in confusion and cannot claim <span class="highlight">rights</span> which existed under the old law - not because they were entitled to such <span class="highlight">rights</span> but because of the inadequacy of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why then is the Government attempting to usurp the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of State authorities in these matters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Appeal provisions in the Mining Act and Public Works Act which enable citizens to lodge objections are waived under the Clutha Development Pty Ltd Agreement Act so that citizens are denied traditional civic <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is pollution, the second is the squandering of the reserves of coking coal on the South Coast of New South Wales and the third refers to the sea bed vis-a-vis the Commonwealth’s sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I propose to deal briefly with 3 points - Firstly, coking coal reserves; secondly, the environment; and thirdly, the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">rights</span> in relation to the seabed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 should like to refer to statements made in relation to an alleged infringement of Commonwealth sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> over the seabed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no infringement on Commonwealth sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My impression is that the ordinary citizens who end up in such  a  position would have no idea of their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore everything must be written into the legislation itself to protect their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no good the Attorney-General saying that a citizen can do this or that something else will happen; the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a citizen have to be written into the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the debate that has taken place so far there has been some very intriguing reference to something called a balance between the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a minority to express its dissent with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the majority to go about its normal and every day life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has come down very heavily against those people in Australia who care to exercise their <span class="highlight">rights</span> of dissent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has always talked in terms of the pressure of minorities and the usurpation of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same sort of approach toward dissent and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a minority characterises the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Government has done in this Bill has been to say that there are two factors - the democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals and public order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, the Government knows only too well that it exploits majority thinking on the civic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But a democratic society cannot subordinate so grossly the <span class="highlight">rights</span> - of individuals and minorities, as the Government does through this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here is a law that has been brought in for the specific purpose of suppressing and limiting your <span class="highlight">rights</span>’ anybody with any political sense at all knows what the reaction will be to this sort of Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill means that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual are to be determined not by this Act of Parliament or by the Australian Constitution because they are not mentioned there, but by a policeman on the spot at a public incident and by the magistrate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill comes down heavily against the lawful <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals and minorities to assemble and to express their individual and group views in an attempt to change opinions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us on this side of the House who attend Party meetings and who can have an influence on the form of legislation that comes before this House would not have a bar of a Bill that limited the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people in the minority putting their point of view to those in authority in a legitimate fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not hesitate to line myself up with those who object to the denial of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> involved in such a situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of Australia will not back this sort of denial of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the ordinary Australian to see and to absorb what he wishes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was completely fallacious for the honourable member for Angas to argue that this Bill is one that will protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, of minorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The plain fact is that this Bill is aimed against the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people in this country to dissent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its most objectionable feature is that it does nothing to indicate clearly what the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to lawful assembly are in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather it further constricts <span class="highlight">rights</span> to protest and obscures just what is allowed and what is not in the public streets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This usually takes the form of sanctimonious expression on the lines that there is a right and proper way to exercise these inalienable <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the components of this right and proper way to express these <span class="highlight">rights</span> are never defined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lead is never given on what is the right- way to express these <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  <span class="highlight">rights</span> are not prescribed; they are discretionary and this discretion is defined in only the crudest and vaguest of terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are measures which could have been undertaken to give substance to the claim by the Government that the Bill would give a meaningful form to basic <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a positive acknowledgment were made of the validity of public protest and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and duties of public dissenters were written into the law, then most of the problems associated with public demonstration in Australia would be eliminated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill represents a further restriction on the individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms of persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People believe that we should protect minority <span class="highlight">rights</span> and should protect certain individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What these views fail to take into account is that an individual in our form of society has duties as well as <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me cite to the House Article 19 of the Declaration pf Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the honourable member heard of the factors in our law which protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding what the honourable member for Lalor suggests it is impossible to introduce a police state in this country because we do have protection of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of personal freedom emanating from wrongful detention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right of public assembly means that people may meet together so long as they do not infringe the laws designed to ensure public order and the recognition of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot be argued that people in this country have no <span class="highlight">rights</span> because they are not written into a constitution, for what that is worth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">rights</span> are in fact something that we can exercise day by day by way of actions for damages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unreasonable obstruction’ means an act or thing done by a person that constitutes, or contributes to, an obstruction of, or interference with, the exercise or enjoyment by other personsof their lawful <span class="highlight">rights</span> or privileges (including <span class="highlight">rights</span> of passage along the public streets) where, having regard to all the circumstances of the obstruction or interference, including its place, time, duration and nature, it constitutes an unreasonable obstruction or interference, and ‘unreasonably obstructs’ has a corresponding meaning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do we mean the enjoyment, including <span class="highlight">rights</span> of passage, of a public street? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 wish that honourable members opposite would stop and take a look at the ordinary <span class="highlight">rights</span> to which people in the community are heirs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that definition we create the right by saying:  unreasonable obstruction’ means an act or thing done by a person that constitutes, or contributes to an obstruction of, or interference with, the exercise or enjoyment by other persons of their lawful <span class="highlight">rights</span> or privileges (including <span class="highlight">rights</span> of passage along the public streets)- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill has touched on one person’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the right of free passage along the streets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government then says that anything left after that, to a perhaps non-political person or a person who attaches little importance to these <span class="highlight">rights</span>, is left over for the person who wants to persuade people that his point of view is right and who wants to exercise his full <span class="highlight">rights</span> in a modern democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have listened to the comments of the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory  (Mr Enderby)  and the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  on the definitions clause, particularly on the definition of ‘unreasonable obstruction’ but I point out to them that the only thing which is prevented is an obstruction which interferes with the lawful <span class="highlight">rights</span> or privileges of other persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not confine it except to eliminate from the entire area of freedom this tiny corner where people are violent or are interfering with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again in the definition, to make sure that the position of the demonstrator, the dissenter, or the person who is assembling or obstructing a street is safeguarded, it is said that regard must be had to all the circumstances of the obstruction or interference, including its place, time, duration and nature before a determination can be made that an act constitutes an unreasonable interference with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we are trespassing into an area in which the Parliament, instead of being prohibitive, inhibitive and restrictive, ought to be protecting people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> as my friend from the Australian Capital Territory  (Mr Enderby)  and my friend from Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not be trying to restrict those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General may get up and say that a young fellow has the right of appeal, that he has the right to go and get a legal eagle to represent him - he has a whole host of <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But does he have these <span class="highlight">rights</span> if he does not have the financial resources? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can understand that they are not in the least interested in legislation that cuts down the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of others, <span class="highlight">rights</span> which they from their positions of eminence no longer regard as necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This clause is yet another way ki which the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of free assembly are being curtailed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier tonight I heard the honourable member for Reid  (Mr Uren)  quoting evidence that in this country we have no <span class="highlight">rights</span> of assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By these 3 factors, as has been mentioned, we have the right to say, firstly, that this clause is harsh and unreasonable; secondly, it is unnecessary because of the State Jaw; and thirdly, it takes away any <span class="highlight">rights</span> that the accused might have had under the British common law system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made the point tonight that honourable members on this side of the House are opposed to this clause of the Bill and demand that an individual ought to have further <span class="highlight">rights</span> in regard to a charge and the right to be tried by his peers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Lalor suggested also that <span class="highlight">rights</span> were being curtailed by this clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, if a group of 500 people are taking part in a demonstration and 2 of them are involved in unlawful violence or unlawful damage, is that sufficient reason for a police officer to break up the assembly and deny the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of 49S other men? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the way through this debate we have been told that this Bill is doing something about <span class="highlight">rights</span> but nowhere has anyone on behalf of the Government said anything that would indicate what a right is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I propose to exercise my <span class="highlight">rights</span> under the Standing Orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hadintended to exercise my <span class="highlight">rights</span> under standing order 193 and have my dissent recorded in Hansard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not vote willingly for anything that includes the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of lower courts to send people to gaol, particularly for offences such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, the Agreement specifically provides that when it is judged that prices and related <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations are capable of successful negotiation, the International Wheat Council shall arrange a further conference with the objective of bringing them into effect within the life of the Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the matters to be dealt with at the conference will be fishing and the conservation of the living resources of the high seas, including the preferential <span class="highlight">rights</span> of coastal states. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Protests against the tour have nothing to do with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australians to enjoy a summer’s afternoon watching cricket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inescapable truth is this: If this tour were to take place and if, as the Prime Minister has gratuitously urged the Australian public, the visitors were given a warm welcome, we would be branded throughout the world, not least in South Africa herself, at best as a people who put our passing pleasure before the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of millions of human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In considering the question of recognition, just as for the question of representation at the United Nations, we must also pay regard to the status and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Peking of course, denies’ that the people of Taiwan and their Government have any independent status or <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This policy was aimed at denying China its <span class="highlight">rights</span> and recognition as a great power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for that reason that I would like to see their <span class="highlight">rights</span> recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>in the 1960s there was serious trouble between India and China, India nevertheless has maintained the view consistently that it should continue diplomatic relations with the Chinese and should continue to press for the granting of legitimate <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the People’s Republic of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our support for the restoration of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the People’s Republic of China is based on the principles of the universality of our Organisation as also on the provisions of the Charter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Government has defended its refusal to grant recognition to China and to approve its membership of the United Nations on the grounds that it had to defend the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of 14i million Taiwanese,  Mr Fraser  totally reversed the argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to see that when we take money from them through a tax scheme, whether it is voluntary on the side of the contributors or compulsory on the side of taxpayers as it is to prop up this scheme, we get as much mileage as we can out of every $1 that we spend of their money, consistent with good standards of professional service, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the discussions on the level of the third replenishment, agreement was also reached on a proposal to adjust the relative voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual Part I countries so as to reflect more accurately the total amounts which each such country had, or will have, contributed to IDA since its inception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of background, I might explain that voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> are based on subscriptions to IDA. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By general consensus at the time, it had previously been decided that the additional resources put at IDA’s disposal under the first and second replenishment exercises should not affect voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> and for this reason the commitments then entered into took the form of contributions, and not additional subscriptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will be done by permitting Part I countries to make additional subscriptions, which will carry voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>, to IDA as well as contributions under the third replenishment exercise, the relative proportions between the two varying in each instance so as to produce the overall voting adjustments desired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complex calculations undertaken by the staff of the Association indicated that, of the total amount of $US48m which Australia is expected to make available to IDA over the next 3 years, $US583,440 should take the form of an additional subscription with voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition to the ministerial statements, honourable members on this side of the House, under the traditional rules and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this Parliament, will continue to introduce matters of public importance, and so they should. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That they in fact welcome this change, having regard for the fact that it demon strates an increasing tolerance of and re-  spect for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals to think their own way through their own lives, free from information-withholding restrictions which people of one religion or one standard of morals may seek to impose on either the majority or minority who do not hold the same views; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other ancillary tests, dealing with matters such as <span class="highlight">rights</span> over the appointment of directors, redeemable shares and options to acquire shares and artificial arrangements designed to obtain exemption that otherwise would not have been available, are also proposed as safeguards against devices to circumvent the main tests I have described. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The law will treat this notice as if it were a notice of an income tax assessment, with the consequence that the borrower will have usual <span class="highlight">rights</span> of objection and appeal against the Commissioner’s refusal to give a certificate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That shows what people can do if they stand up for their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that a lot of other people will take notice of the result achieved by the cherry growers in standing up for their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and will follow their example. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not bad going and again illustrates what can be done when people stand up for their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Prime Minister’s recent speech will he advise the House what initiatives have been taken by the Government to protect Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is appropriate to divorce the statements that were made by the 3 left wing unions from the problem of the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australian Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel it is appropriate to point out that in that instance the Government was anxious to ensure that the Aboriginals had every conceivable opportunity to present their case in order to protect whatever legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> they had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next point I want to make is that if the Aboriginals want to pursue their <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the High Court they have every right to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, as the honourable gentleman has noted, at the meeting in Cairns recently, which the Minister for Social Services attended on my behalf, the case was put to the State Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs that the Commonwealth would take the initiative, no matter what the decision might be in this case, to protect the recreational and ceremonial land <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Australian Aboriginals and that this Government would do all it could to ensure that the Aboriginals had adequate opportunities for business enterprises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member tends to ignore both the constitutional <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States and what I believe to be the States’ wishes in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress that it is important that we should recognise the State <span class="highlight">rights</span> involved in the establishment and maintenance of ports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that we all need to recognise that the States have constitutional <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only do they have constitutional <span class="highlight">rights</span> but also do they wish to maintain those <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This committee is intended in no way to usurp the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States but is designed to co-ordinate activities in such  a  way that at least in the future we will have commonsense planning for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that it can be argued, probably successfully, that towards the end of a session honourable members have always taken the opportunity - indeed they have been forced to take it - to protest at the Government’s attitude in curtailing the business of the House, thus restricting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and opportunities of honourable members to speak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe, as the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  has so often said in this House, that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of honourable members are being denied to them by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable member for Bradfield  (Mr Turner),  the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  and honourable members on this side of the House have said so adequately, eloquently and continuously today, we are departing so serously from the traditions of general parliamentary government and democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> that, we are putting the Parliament itself in a hopeless position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst I can understand that particularly for an underdeveloped people a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> provides a tangible expression of personal privileges, nevertheless the proposal has drawbacks which can overweigh its usefulness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> seeks to outline in printed form concepts which in themselves are extremely difficult to define. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst we have the principle of absolute equality of citizens before the law - with everyone, no matter what his station, subject to the law - whilst we have the independence of the judiciary and whilst we have the right of freedom of speech and assembly so long as the freedoms of other people are not infringed, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual citizens are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will come back to that word ‘schedule’ -  but at the same time there must be a full recognition of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all members to adequate debating time for general and private members’ business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that the amendment which has been moved expresses the complete disapproval, not only of honourable members in this House but also of the nation, of the actions of the Prime Minister, of his complete disregard for the forms of this House and for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members of this Parliament and, as I have already indicated, of the completely contemptuous attitude which he has adopted towards the legislation that is on the notice paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Opposition expressed this morning, in a motion to which the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  did not reply but which related to him, our feelings about the procedures that have been adopted in trying to crash through the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of honourable members and to force Bills through at the rate of one every half-hour and sometimes through the Committee stage in 2 minutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In so taking responsibility he has, as every honourable member will recognise, curtailed the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of honourable members to study legislation and to speak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of these 2 Bills is to give effect to the Government’s proposals for the preservation of superannuation <span class="highlight">rights</span> of contributors to the 3 contributory retirement benefits schemes established under the Superannuation Act 1922-1969 and the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948-1970, namely, the Superannuation Fund, the Provident Account- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, a person who moves to public employment with the States, including State universities, will be able to preserve his superannuation <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they transfer from the armed Services to the ordinary Service or from the ordinary Service to the armed Services, at least their <span class="highlight">rights</span> are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would involve the preservation of superannuation <span class="highlight">rights</span> not only of each of the contributors covered by the Bills - some 250,000 people - but also of contributors in other Commonwealth schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it is desirable that Commonwealth employees be denied the advantages of the preservation of these <span class="highlight">rights</span> pending consideration of a national superannuation scheme applying to the whole of the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 25th September 1969, which is 20 months ago, in the period preceding the general elections the then Prime Minister first gave notice of his Government’s intention to facilitate the preservation of superannuation <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One wonders what the Government’s underlying philosophy is on this question of transferability of superannuation from one employer to another - a process known as the preservation of superannuation <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would finish on this note: I hope that the challenge to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Commonwealth to levy payroll tax is successful because I think it is inequitable and improper for the Commonwealth to levy payroll tax on organisations such as local government authorities which can raise revenue only by the levying of taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But to refer to Tasmania for a moment, I am well aware of the problem which the honourable member for Dennison  (Dr Solomon)  has raised concerning apple processing and a glut of particular types of bulk apple products in Australia, but I remind the honourable member that if he can talk about Tasmania having certain <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Australia with regard to apples I can talk about Victoria having a certain right in Australia with regard to pears. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is directed to the Prime Minister, arises out of the tragic news that reached us at the end of last week from the Gazelle Peninsula and the reminder in it of the intensity of feeling about Aboriginal claims for land <span class="highlight">rights</span> - whether they are made in Papua New Guinea or here in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the light of this and of accounting difficulties associated with capital works undertaken by the respective States on the railway, the Commonwealth Government has agreed to waive its <span class="highlight">rights</span> to share in the distribution of any surplus revenue or profit from the operation of the railway, and thus has enabled the agreement to be wholly discharged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following upon my correspondence with him regarding the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of 18 to 20-year-old persons to vote in Federal elections under section 41 of the Constitution, what is the reason for the Government’s refusal to allow 18 to 20-year-old persons to vote in Federal elections in States where they have the right to vote for their State parliaments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The need for further development of the Bretton Woods arrangements has long been recognised, and the most recent innovation has been the establishment of special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> which, in themselves, offer some alternative to the United States dollar and gold as an international reserve asset. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The possibility of an equitable exchange of <span class="highlight">rights</span> for an Australian carrier to serve Guam for <span class="highlight">rights</span> for an American carrier to serve Port Moresby was raised with the United States authorities in Washington on 10th November 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The man who now wears the shoes of Prime Minister and who in March of this year was speaking of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Parliament, before a month had passed was causing Bills to be rushed through this House and the Parliament to sit at all hours and into the morning so that he might close down the Parliament as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I do believe it is important that we should take some steps to preserve the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the rank and file members of this Parliament, not only on this side of the House but on the other side too as the honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Grassby)  has pointed out, and to bring forward public business and have it discussed with regularity and without, interference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand when the same set of rules and the same arguments are advanced by the trade union movement to obtain compulsory unionism or preference to unionists in order that all workers in a particular trade or calling equally share the cost of obtaining the best possible wages and conditions Government supporters completely disregard the principle that they have legislated for in the rural sector and raise the hackneyed cry of conscience and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did Australia at the recent meetings of the International Monetary Fund indicate any firm view on the following matters: Expansion in the amount of special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> and their allocation; variations in the price of gold; the floating of the Australian exchange rate, either managed or freely determined, sometimes described as dirty or clean; the removal of the surcharges on American imports; and control over capital movements? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Earlier I started to mention - I curtailed it because I suspected that I would have to conclude my speech - the sort of development of services which is absolutely essential, in my opinion, if we are going to be responsible and humane in our approach not only to the needs but also the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of every human being in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first is that those <span class="highlight">rights</span> and needs are being maintained at a high level and protected at that level and, secondly, that when we spend the taxpayers money we do so in the most efficient way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It lends support for my belief that under this Government the Department of Health has had its functions narrowly circumscribed within the ideological dogmas of the Government; that is, the Department does very little to examine and improve the health care of the nation, because it is preoccupied with making the Government’s health insurance scheme stave off failure and because it is afraid of cutting across Liberal dogmas about State <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his recent discussions overseas on international monetary arrangements did he indicate any firm views as far as Australia was concerned on the following matters: Increases in special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> and their allocation; international capital movements; floating exchange rates, dirty or clean; the price of gold; and the American surcharge on imports? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So far as special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> are concerned, we indicated that we supported an examination through the International Monetary Fund to increase use of them, but we did point out that we do not believe that there should be an abandonment of the present world monetary system with all the benefits it has given over the last quarter of a century until we really know what would be the benefits and how they could be sustained through an SDR or international currency system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another, and more far-reaching, aspect of this matter is its significance for the role of gold in the monetary system in the future; and in that context although the Managing Director of the Fund,  Mr Schweitzer,  has made the valid point that any outcome to the present impasse which did not involve gold in at least maintaining its value relative to the average appreciation of other currencies against the US dollar would not only affect the future of gold but also the future of Special Drawing <span class="highlight">Rights</span> which are, of course, defined in terms of gold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two decisions I have mentioned have made it clear that many other similar orders are of questionable validity, and it is most desirable that the doubts that at present exist in relation to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of persons affected by such orders be removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">rights</span> are of vital importance to the individuals affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Bill will remove the doubts that have arisen by providing that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of such persons  aTe  to be the same as they would have been if the orders had been validly made - that is, made by a judge of the supreme court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of this provision will be that, in the case of an order that an officer of the court has purported to make in accordance with the long established practice to which I have referred, the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, liabilities, obligations and status of all persons will, by force of the Act, be the same as if the purported order had been made by a judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in the many cases to which the Bill will apply, it will provide for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of persons to be as it was intended that they should be when the purported orders were made, and will place the persons affected in the same position as they believed themselves to be in before the High Court decisions which I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I can see nothing wrong with establishing a standing committee of this Parliament to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens in cases where they might believe that an injustice has been done, and particularly where the local member himself believes that his constituent has suffered an injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The High Court has got itself into a mental gymnastic situation because in the first, say, 10 or 20 years - certainly until the engineers case - it believed that all the <span class="highlight">rights</span> were with the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 24th August 1971 in the Senate in reply to a question asked by  Senator Carrick,  the newly arrived senator from New South Wales, the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  said:   all my endeavours are designed to ensure that the privacy and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals, subject to law, are protected and preserved as far as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In summary ] put it to the Minister, and I expect him to accept, that the matter I am about to raise is not advanced with any view to obstructing or harrassing ASIO but only to ensure that a proper balance is maintained between the duties and functions of the organisation on the one hand and individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> on the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, in the drafting of these provisions care has been taken to ensure that proper safeguards exist for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the defendant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Among the changes in policy this would bring are:  (1)  An end to the principle that the US alliance is crucial, and  a  beginning of support for the ‘human <span class="highlight">rights</span>’ revolution around the world most often expressed in the national liberation movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this respect the position of Papua New Guinea is parallel with a good many tropical African countries and with the West Indies but that <span class="highlight">rights</span> of entry have been extended to Papua New Guinea is very welcome, lt could be that in the future an expansion of trade will develop between Papua New Guinea and the EEC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are now discussing the war service homes legislation, and frankly I am appalled that the Minister should display such ignorance and lack of knowledge about what after all is one of the most important pieces of legislation that has been introduced into this Parliament dealing with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of ex-servicemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it is reasonable and proper that a Government which, over a considerable period, has consisently claimed that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of exservicemen should be paramount, has claimed also that it is not easy or not possible to maintain a volunteer army, and has based its case before the electorate on this type of platform should accept the amend men! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>ls he satisfied with the present stopgap procedure outlined in the Constitution under which this House acts on the rules of privilege of the House of Commons of the nineteenth century but actually dating in precedent back to the Middle Ages, a procedure in which the accused person has none of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of an accused person in any court of justice anywhere in the British Commonwealth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711130_reps_27_hor75/#debate-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have said before that I feel that the greatest threat to that national unity - the one spark which may cause an explosion - is the fear that exists in some areas that the central government in Port Moresby will sweep away their land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 16th July 1970 the Australian Dried Fruits Association sent a telegram to the State Ministers for Agriculture and to the Federal Minister for Primary Industry pointing out this danger and asking for steps to be taken to facilitate the termination of planting by legislation, restriction of water <span class="highlight">rights</span> or by any other means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Percentage returns offered to the Department by tenders for concession <span class="highlight">rights</span> are based on the tenderers’ own business judgment of the turnover the business will achieve over the period of the concession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-40-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I admit that the States have argued that they have sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this matter, but does anybody really believe that they have sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to Federation there were no such sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> given to any State by  Her  Majesty’s Government, and it was not until after Federation and Australia had become an independent nation that these <span class="highlight">rights</span> obviously were conferred on the independent nation of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If honourable members read the judgment of the then Chief Justice,  Sir Owen  Dixon, they will find that his opening words were: This has been brought to settle <span class="highlight">rights</span> and to determine henceforth as to where these matters lie.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Merely to put straight the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of an individual on this issue - I do not suggest that a company do this - I say that there is nothing to prevent a person turning up at an inquiry to give his evidence without having given any of it in writing in advance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, it is pertinent to remember that the accused had no right to legal representation, no right to hear evidence, no right to question witnesses, no right to call witnesses, indeed none of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of an accused in any British court of justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There co-exist, however, countervailing devices which ensure that any attempt by the public company shareholder to exercise its ostensible <span class="highlight">rights</span> can easily be defeated by the private company interests so that the public company <span class="highlight">rights</span> are, in fact, worthless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One sees no evidence of planning to combat them in the interest of people’s social and economic <span class="highlight">rights</span>; one sees only a sort of smug calmness on the part of the Government - no doubt the product of total ignorance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And that this procedure providing for selection by a method of chance is an unfair and arbitrary imposition on the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a minority and discriminates against certain of the young male persons in the community in favour of others solely by reason of their respective dates of birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fundamentally, the Government’s aim is to have one Australian society in which all Australians - including Aboriginal Australians - will have equal <span class="highlight">rights</span>, responsibilities and opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Government is going to consult with any Aboriginal communities which might be affected by such mining activities so that their welfare will be taken into account when applications for exploration and mining development <span class="highlight">rights</span> are being considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Exploration <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be granted on the basis that the granting of development <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be deferred if, in the Government’s view, they would be detrimental to the interests and well-being of an Aboriginal community in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was forecast in all the various Communist media that land <span class="highlight">rights</span> would become the big issue in 1972 in view of the fact that Australia was withdrawing its troops from Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Emotional speeches, high sounding phrases and cliches and a clamour for land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in itself will not overcome the disabilities of the Australian Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Essentially the Government’s aim is to have a single Australian society, including Australian Aborigines, having equal <span class="highlight">rights</span>, responsibilities and opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any sensible debate or discussion of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Northern Territory must start with the basic facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the Government recognises the deep attachment that Aboriginal people have to land but it cannot reverse the whole course of Australian history without interfering with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What do people mean when they press for land <span class="highlight">rights</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Outside this Parliament, according to Press reports, a spokesman for Aborigines said that they wanted full State <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Northern Territory under Aboriginal ownership and all titles for mineral ownership together with all other reserves and settlements in Australia with their titles to mining and mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They want mineral and mining <span class="highlight">rights</span> in certain towns and cities, preservation of all sacred Aboriginal sites - this, of course, is being done - and compensation with an initial payment of $6 billion for all other land throughout Australia and a percentage of the gross national product each year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the principal claim for land <span class="highlight">rights</span> seems to be for compensation for land which it is claimed was taken away from the Aborigines over the past 200 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span> are to be accepted for the Yirrkala at Gove by what logic can they be denied to the Larrakeah people in Darwin? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A rich lode of amethyst is being mined high on an adjacent hill and prospecting <span class="highlight">rights</span> are held over other areas of the reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But he had the cheek to say in this House that those who were sponsoring Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> and who were campaigning for land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, for social advancement and for a change in the social and economic position of the Aboriginal people of Australia were inspired or led by communists and that it was some sort of deep, dark, Red plot - if that is not a contradiction in colours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He says that those who sponsor land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the Aboriginal people do not know what they are talking about and that they are under Red dominion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To stand up and speak for your <span class="highlight">rights</span> as a free Australian is not division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aborigines who step into the community to assert their <span class="highlight">rights</span>, to show what they stand for and to speak in their own right are speaking as part of the real Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all there is the question of land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, it is not a question of freehold, leasehold or anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that article all the necessary quotations can be found on the attitude to land <span class="highlight">rights</span> adopted over 2 centuries ago by the British Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people in North America, from which the general principles of North American legislation flow, were to be dealt with severely if they damaged Indian <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The approach so far, from what I have heard from the earlier speakers, has been towards land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That fellow has not been hesitant in asserting his own <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, when he mentions land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aborigines does he include Torres Strait Islanders? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly, would they be allowed to control all mining <span class="highlight">rights</span> on this land, and if it was found that mineral wealth existed there would they be allowed to enter into negotiations for mining concessions with overseas organisations if these organisations wished to develop this mineral wealth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Finally, I ask the Leader of the Opposition: Is what he spoke about today but has not covered fully yet ALP policy on land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aborigines or is it his own thoughts on the matter or something he dreamed up on the spur of the moment for political expediency to gain the support of the coloured people prior to the next election? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has been reported that the so-called Aboriginal embassy opposite Parliament House is seeking full State <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the Northern Territory under Aboriginal ownership and all titles for mineral ownership, ownership of all other reserves and settlements in Australia with titles to their mining and mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span> and mineral and mining <span class="highlight">rights</span> in certain towns and cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his statement the Minister for the Environment Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  outlined the Government’s policy on Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> - a policy with which I am sure the great majority of our coloured people will be happy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not deny the achievements of his Government in education but if he is saying that a white backlash will develop because of special programmes in land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, then will it not at the same time develop a white backlash if there are special programmes in education? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That exclusive corporate land <span class="highlight">rights</span> be granted to Aboriginal communities which retain a strong tribal structure or demonstrate a potential for corporate action in regard to land at present reserved for the use of Aborigines, or where traditional occupancy according to tribal custom can be established from anthropological or other evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> shall carry with them full <span class="highlight">rights</span> to minerals in those lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An interesting statement of the Government’s altitude to land <span class="highlight">rights</span> was made in the last publication by the Government on Australian Aborigines, made under the authority of the then Minister for Territories, the hon C. E. Barnes, in July 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It sees Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> as being a transitional phase in the history of the Aboriginal people from which they eventually will emerge when they merge into the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Presumably they could sell out to other Aborigines, but it would be a corporate trust We do not want them to be like the Red Indians in the United States who, when they received land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, had a situation where generations of chiefs lived it up and their descendants have remained paupers to this day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to develop schemes where these people can be compensated for loss of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and this probably means acquiring allotments and assisting Aborigines to obtain houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, for many tens of thousands of Aborigines in urban areas - the indications are that over 60 per cent of those Aborigines at least need rehousing because of low standard accommodation - we must develop schemes of compensation for loss of land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We stand for corporate <span class="highlight">rights</span> and ownership in respect of those lands which are already designated as lands set aside for Aboriginal purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite a sensible thing to say: ‘You can have corporate <span class="highlight">rights</span> if you have the capacity to run your Aboriginal reserve, to own it and to utilise it’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We make no apology for -the fact that we intend to put our alternative programme to the people of this country because it is not only idealistic but it is also in keeping with the programme which operates in other countries where there are indigenous people, if ever there was an occasion of anti-Australian statements it was the no land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aborigines speech delivered on Australia Day by the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am in contact with Aboriginal people, as are several of my colleagues here, and know that every Aboriginal organisation throughout Australia now feels that it is time to come together to achieve the objective of land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He tended to create the impression first of all that the Australian Labor Party was concerned with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and needs of all forms of education but fell into the trap once again of using the wealth of particular schools as a weapon to push his Party’s own sense of a needs policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The alienated comfortable who have become the new avant-garde of the Labor Party have adopted a most sophisticated form of supporting the principles of flat denial operative during the 1950s and 1960s because these principles are an effective denial of <span class="highlight">rights</span> and, unfortunately, it amounts to an effective denial of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of children at all schools in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are to be <span class="highlight">rights</span> of appeal as far as promotions are concerned, but there is to be no right of appeal against this discretion which is to be ‘given to this one man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is cause for suspicion from a reading of clause 16 of the Bill that the Commissioner - the one-man authority - will have the right to intrude into such fields as the determining of teaching <span class="highlight">rights</span> and class sizes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are based upon deep professional experience and they evince a greater concern for the needs of the student than for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the teacher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The teachers in the Australian Capital Territory also raised with me the question of the preservation of existing and accruing <span class="highlight">rights</span> of State teachers joining the Commonwealth Teaching Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other point about this matter is that because these teachers are not British subjects they will be denied a number of <span class="highlight">rights</span> which cannot be backdated to the time of their joining the service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So even though they may work for 30 years after they have become naturalised, they lose their <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the first 3 years of their service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I make this kind of speech -I know that my colleagues support me - to register our protest at the interference with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the next Government of this country in not letting it legislate properly in accordance with the accepted practice of all democratic parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the denial of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and civil liberties in the U.S.S.R. is of more urgent consideration than development of cultural exchanges between the U.S.S.R. and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-0-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And that this is an unfair imposition on the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-0-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would ask him to look a little more closely at his own proposals and attitudes towards the Australian population, the people involved in its development and his proposals for immigration, Australian families, the numbers of children born in Australia and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australian children, old, young and even unborn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have dealt, of course, principally with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of migration and I have relied on answers given to me and my colleagues by the relevant Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second principle should be to endeavour to preserve the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of migrants to Australia who are not enjoying in Australia the full <span class="highlight">rights</span> that they would have acquired in those other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it is important for us to try to protect, for example, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of certain German pensioners who, because they have become naturalised as Australian citizens, have lost their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to German pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall certainly try, in negotiating this with the German Government, as far as possible to preserve here in Australia the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of former German nationals who have become Australian citizens and are resident in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is that we should preserve in Australia the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of migrants who have come with pension <span class="highlight">rights</span>, which they might otherwise lose, from their own country overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point is that this Bill if accepted would give away entirely the bargaining position of the Australian Government to protect the pension <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people who have acquired them overseas and who have subsequently come to Australia and become Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am simply saying that if the Bill were adopted it would not put us in the position where we could bargain with overseas governments in order to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australian citizens who were formerly nationals of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>People’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be determined and assessed under this Bill if it becomes legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore more restrictive than the present <span class="highlight">rights</span> as at present there is not that confinement in all cases to Austraiian citizenship as the criterion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite complain readily ; I do not argue the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or wrongs ; about an increase in the price of steel or any other commodity, but we do not hear any suggestion that productivity is a matter of grave and considerable responsibility for the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, those who have made those representations have apparently paid scant attention to the contents of the Bill because they allege that the Bill is an attack on public servants’ <span class="highlight">rights</span>, that it is provocative and will not make for effective industrial relations in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When questioned as to what changes this would bring if it occurred, the honourable member replied that the ALP policy would be changed to bring an end to the principle that the United States alli ance is crucial and that there would be  a  beginning of support for the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> revolution around the world, more often expressed in the national liberation movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That on 10th December 1948, Australia signed the ‘Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>’, Article 25 reads: ‘Everyone has the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age and other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would have thought that the honourable member, coming from an electorate in the far north of Queensland, an area concerned about the development of that State and more specifically about the harnessing of the resources and the capacity for development of the area he represents, would have made a forthright and aggressive speech on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the State of Queensland in relation to the allocation of Commonwealth money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matters which affect adult <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Australia usually fall within the province of the State parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But by the end of the next month men and women of 18, 19 and 20 years of age in South Australia will not only have adult <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the general sense; they will also have the right to vote at elections for the more numerous House of the Parliament of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On what matters and what dates (a) has each State Parliament enacted, and (b) has each State Government proclaimed or will it proclaim legislation giving adult <span class="highlight">rights</span> to persons under 21 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Act provides that persons who have attained the age of 18 years shall be of full age and capacity except for certain specified matters including conditions, <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the heading ‘Western Australia’ the Attorney-General informed me that some adult <span class="highlight">rights</span> had been given to minors in the age group 18 to 21 years and that they had been given the right to vote for the State Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since then the Western Australian Labor Government has announced that it will give complete adult <span class="highlight">rights</span> to 18- year-old men and women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite likely, therefore, that by the end of next month, when those who have adult <span class="highlight">rights</span> will also gain the right to vote in South Australia for the State Parliament, those who have the right to vote at 18 years of age in Western Australia for the State Parliament will also have adult <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision was put there in connection with the voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines, not of persons under 21, but it is clearly applicable to the age issues as well if section 41 of the Constitution is interpreted as 1 have suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I would urge the Government, gracefully and promptly, to give voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> to those citizens, just as such citizens will have that right in this year’s United States elections, as they have had in the British and will have in the Canadian elections, as they have had in Papua New Guinea, as they have had in Western Australia as they will have in every future South Australian election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tasmania, until recently under a Liberal Government, is ready to grant 18 year olds full civil and voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly the case for votes for those of 18 years of age is supported by world opinion, by advanced nations and on the grounds of democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government had acted democratically it would long ago have drawn up the uniform legislation with the States that the Minister spoke about covering all the <span class="highlight">rights</span> that go with adulthood or the age of legal responsibility, such as the right to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Basically, the philosophy of the current and previous governments in relation to organisations registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is that they are voluntary organisations and the Government should not interfere in their affairs unless it can be demonstrated that there are or are likely to be dishonest practices which would prejudice the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members or groups of members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government, through its spokesman on industrial matters, the Minister for Labour and National Service, is quite prepared to bring down rules and regulations in order to negate the obvious and honourable <span class="highlight">rights</span> of working people, but it is not prepared to take a stand so far as other amalgamations are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth believes that, except for internal waters as they existed at Federation, it has sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order that this may happen, my Government will ask the Parliament to pass legislation to assert and establish what the Commonwealth conceives to be its legal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In February 1969 Cabinet made a very clear decision that the Commonwealth would legislate to assert total <span class="highlight">rights</span> over the seabed outside the 3-mile limit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 have exercised such <span class="highlight">rights</span> as 1 have as a member of my Party and as a member of the House to procure that some discussion takes place in this the national Parliament, on a matter that I do regard as a very important one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the State Ministers behaved almost with frenzy in their attacks, underhand and public, on the Commonwealth for trying to declare that the Commonwealth has the sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> over these off-shore resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not and never profess to be a lawyer, but one only has to read the evidence put forward by people whose judgment one can respect to come to the conclusion, as it would seem to me, that at no time did the States have sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> over the off-shore resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the Commonwealth Government took into account a view expressed 2 years ago by the Past  President  of the International Court of Justice - that apart from inland waters, sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> over the seabed and natural resources of the continental shelf vested exclusively in the Commonwealth from low water mark outwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the High Court judgment in the cass of Bonser v. La Macchia in August 1969 the 2 judges stated firm views that in respect of the sea bed the Commonwealth had consitutional <span class="highlight">rights</span> from the low water mark. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the United States of America this was also allowed with respect to some States having <span class="highlight">rights</span> to exploit, explore and develop oil and natural gas resources off their own coastlines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under general international law, and despite certain recent claims and attempts, there is no warrant for the establishment by coastal states of exclusive fishery limits separated from the proper limits of territorial waters, or for the assertion of exclusive fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span> in areas going beyond these. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly I believe that on the western side straight lines can be drawn from Cape Wessel down to the  Sir Edward  Pellew group of islands and the area shut off could be for the exclusive fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the decision may be, if the boundary is redrawn in that part of the world these people must retain certain <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Australian social service payments, repatriation benefits, medical services and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their <span class="highlight">rights</span> have to be taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If this Parliament refuses to pass the legislation, Australia’s national <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this matter go by default. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>at some time before the adoption of the 1958 conventions on the Territorial Sea and the Continental Shelf, Australia had become an independent nation state, ,md the <span class="highlight">rights</span> recognised by those conventions accrued a their entirety to the Commonwealth of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we go to the international conference and the territorial sea boundaries are changed from  3  to  12  miles, from  3  to  20  miles or whatever it may be, we must know that our representatives who are at that conference are speaking for this nation with the authority of national law to back them up in what they say and that there can be no question of whether they have or have not the <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Where else could it happen but in Australia that the Attorney-General of the national Government and the SolicitorGeneral of New South Wales tiptoe like mice into court in a case that was itself a test case as to Commonwealth sovereignty and ask the court not to proceed to give a verdict as to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or the sovereignty of the Commonwealth and the States? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that this is the key to the situation and the method we should adopt because not only will it be effective, if anything will be effective, in achieving this objective, but also we will be able to apply it to any other health hazard that faces this country without infringing on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of anybody in any other field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr O’Malley  and I assured them that their interests and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all Australian citizens and overseas visitors were best protected by a full disclosure of the facts so that the public can be fully informed of just what is going on in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I for one have welcomed the new movement - the special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> - that has been in existence now for some 3 years or so, which provides for the automatic creation of credit at an international level to allow for the fact that in a growing world population with rising standards, the volume of international liquidity must continue to rise and that it ought not to be dependent upon the price of gold as a metal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australians - from receiving pension <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But he is not eligible for portability <span class="highlight">rights</span> until he has resided here for 20 years whereas a resident of Australia, if this Bill is passed, will be eligible to go overseas at any time and take his pension with him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To have such a cavalier attitude towards the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those who have earned their Australian pensions and have received less than justice all their lives is surely the mark of one who has scant regard for the welfare of migrants or pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It intends to use the pension <span class="highlight">rights</span> of persons who intend to return to their homelands to win pension <span class="highlight">rights</span> from the homeland of pensioners who have come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, on the Leader of the Opposition’s own figures, one-third of all migrants who come to Australia would be deprived of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Labor Party’s Bill which requires citizenship were passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intent of the Bill is to provide that in any reciprocal agreement this German migrant could become naturalised without losing his German pension entitlement and, conversely, an Australian who is in receipt of some social service payment who goes to Germany and there becomes a naturalised German citizen would not lose his Australian <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So none of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> no matter how limited enjoyed by those in the first 3 categories are enjoyed by those in the fourth category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The German citizen who becomes an Australian loses all his <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The 2 matters of difference between the Government’s Bill and the Opposition’s amendment relate to the period of residence which enables a migrant to become eligible for portability <span class="highlight">rights</span> and to reciprocal agreements on pensions with other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it was equally the intention of parliament simply to ensure that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and wrongs of the matter which had led to a strike should be fully dealt with by discussion at a conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and entitlements of claimants were not affected in any way, it was not considered necessary to inform professional social workers or the general public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-43-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What progress has been made since his predecessor’s answer on 20th April 1971 (Hansard, page 1731) toward introducing the further legislation required to enable Australia to become a party to the Neighbouring <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Convention of 1961. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-43-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would deny the traditional right of Australians to choose their own home sites and it would deny the personal <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australians which they have always exerted in these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is also correct that contract officers seconded from the Commonwealth or the States who have their <span class="highlight">rights</span> preserved in their home services are also covered by legislation, but other contract officers are not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Basically, the philosophy of the current and previous Governments in relation to organisations registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is that they are voluntary organisations and the Government should not interfere in their affairs unless it can be demonstrated that there are or are likely, to be dishonest practices which would prejudice the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members or groups of members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Aboriginal embassy’s letter told the Queen that, if the ordinance is allowed to become law, it is likely to result in a serious abrogation of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all Australians, whether Aboriginal or otherwise, to bring before the Federal Parliament a continuous peaceful protest <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I travelled 21,000 miles with a select committee inquiring into Aboriginal voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but that place was a palace compared to what I saw as a member of that committee and the conditions under which Aborigines live in the south-west of Western Australia, around Gnowangerup and elsewhere where the weather is extremely cold, or generally speaking, throughout the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The legislation does not restrict the traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span> of freedom of speech or assembly or the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people to protest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had nothing to do with tents or with people camping on Commonwealth Crown Land, The real opposition from the Government, the real thing that offended it, the real thing it could not stomach, was the reminder out there by those 2 flags, the sign ‘Aboriginal Embassy’ in a symbolic form, and the tents, that these people claim land <span class="highlight">rights</span> - something that was taken from them many years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aborigines made it clear that they hoped to stay there until Parliament began sitting in order to make their point - the Minister says it was a political point - concerning a claim for land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until that time that demonstration had been the most successful peaceful symbol of the Aboriginal claim for land <span class="highlight">rights</span> that one could possibly imagine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, we remember that the thread running through the Minister’s speeches has been that ‘perhaps they do not want land <span class="highlight">rights</span>; perhaps they want a club or something like that in Canberra’; or ‘Perhaps if I offer them something they will go away and they will not trouble me with their unpleasant, embarrassing political demands’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The clenched fist salute was given and chants for land <span class="highlight">rights</span> could be heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They talked about the cause of Aborigines and the cause of land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The protests related to the question of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and it is that policy that we are debating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was an expression of their frustration with the failure of this Government and other governments throughout Australia to acknowledge the legitimate land <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known that the government in this country has never acknowledged the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aborigines in the way in which the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Red Indians of Canada and the United States of America and the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the indigenous populations of South America and other places were acknowledged by the respective colonial governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a symbol of their fight for land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>FCAATSI would have been accused by every young militant Aboriginal in Australia of selling out the cause of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the lease of land in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other reasons are the obvious, complete failure by the Government to recognise the just claims for land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the hollow gestures that have been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an honourable member on the other side said, it has nothing to do with land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and nothing to do with anything other than the Minister’s propriety in handling the erection of tents in front of Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are to be areas which are reserved for the public, which the public can walk over and enjoy and on which the public can exercise their <span class="highlight">rights</span>, then the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the public will be infringed if any organisation is allowed to set up tents, to park caravans or in any other way to impede the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the public on those reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the instance which is under discussion the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the public were definitely infringed on one occasion when some members of the public were moved on from the vicinity of the King George V Memorial by some of the individuals who were camped in the tents outside Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly if these lawns are to be preserved - I believe they should be, otherwise we will have a tent city in which any organisation can erect a tent and this would be an unsanitary and unhealthy public eyesore and would obstruct the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the public - action has to be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that 3 Japanese companies, Marubeni Corporation, Okura Shoii and Nipon Kohan and Kaisha (Japan Steel and Tube Corporation) have been negotiating with an Australian company, Magellan Petroleum Australia Ltd, which owns natural gas concession <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Palm Valley, south-west of Alice Springs, to develop the natural gas resources of the Northern Territory and export natural gas to Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the Government’s recent blunder in the purchase of Everard Park and in view of his policy statement on Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, will the Prime Minister give an undertaking to the Parliament that all documents and details of financial transactions relating to the purchase of Everard Park will be tabled in this House for consideration and debate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I challenge him to show the type of leadership that Joh BjelkePetersen claims he does not have, to show it by calling upon the Queensland Premier and the  Deputy  Premier, either publicly if he has the courage or at least privately, to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people of Brisbane and to preserve the style of democracy which exists in the city of Brisbane for the citizens of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is well known to honourable members opposite and to the public that the Commonwealth entered the field of education as a whole - it is, as you know,  Mr Speaker,  a vast field - substantially at the higher levels of education, notably at the tertiary level, where the educating was essentially carried out by autonomous or semi-autonomous institutions from univer sities down and where it was much easier to involve the Commonwealth in considerable capital expenditure without transgressing the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States and their education departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it not remarkable that a government which expresses itself to be so concerned for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States, so anxious to accommodate State sensitivities and so determined to maintain proper Commonwealth-State relationships should not only arrive at this miserable decision but also should convey it in such an improper and offensive way? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that what I have proposed is some intrusion into the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members but I hope that the common sense of honourable members and the co-operation that the Opposition has already shown in these matters will prevail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that I have said enough to indicate that there is genuine opposition on the part of honourable members on this side of the House, particularly at this early stage of the new sessional period, to the dictatorial attitude adopted by the Government in setting aside what, after all, are the traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span> of honourable members in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I yield to no person in this place in seeking to preserve the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this election year the Minister not only wants to sweep aside the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members but also wants to prevent a discussion of matters that are of terrific importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we did not oppose every move to whittle down the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members we would be giving away <span class="highlight">rights</span> that will never be recovered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liberal Party approach, as outlined in the Treasurer’s Budget Speech, is short-sighted, inadequate and has no philosophy of basie <span class="highlight">rights</span> or justice either for individuals or industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last year the Communist Party paper ‘Tribune’ called for a mass movement to make land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aboriginals the big issue in 1972 to replace the Vietnam war which it claimed was winding down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In regard to education, the Leader of the Opposition would set up a huge commission in Canberra to control all education in Australia, taking away all State <span class="highlight">rights</span> - that is what it would mean with control in Canberra - and indeed the inalienable right of parents to send their children to whichever school they choose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can only regard the action by the people concerned as being in very poor taste and interfering with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals to conduct their worship - in this case, Mass at the Cathedral throughout Sunday - and I hope that people who desire to protest in some way or another will respect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people to worship in this country as they so wish, without this sort of impediment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This matter has gone far beyond any question of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here is a law - a delegated piece of legislation - which was made on a Thursday morning, when people could not obtain copies of it, and which affected fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> without Parliament being given any opportunities at all to discuss it’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It goes far beyond the question of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and becomes an abuse of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are making a political point beyond the point of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, which originally brought them there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are seeking in this Parliament, as I believe we should, to preserve the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals to speak to issues what we must do is to act in such a way that an expression of a point of view by a minority group, the expression of dissent or consent and the expression of approval or disapproval can be preserved, and this was implied in the statement made by the Minister for the Interior. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not right for this Parliament to deprive people of <span class="highlight">rights</span> which have accrued to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those people who were ingenious enough to think of this operation in the first instance did so on the clear cut issue that they wanted some recognition by the people of Australia through their Government on land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For a few hours yesterday on the lawns outside this House a few pieces of canvass flew as an assertion of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and dignity of the Australian Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today this Bill has been brought in to delay another historically inevitable event - the assertion by the Australian Aborigines of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> as human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is if the law has something to do with lands, <span class="highlight">rights</span>, people and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that case action was taken to take away the accrued <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a very prominent businessman,  Mr Gordon  Barton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What an example we set of law and order, of decent procedures and of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances we will not vote against the second reading but we will move an amendment in Committee to preserve the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of persons who were affected by the proceedings outside this House on 20th and 23rd July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I would hope that no Minister ever again will overlook the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens to resist arrest if the arrest is being made without authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A citizen has <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A policeman is a citizen too, but he has no greater <span class="highlight">rights</span> than another citizen unless the law expressly gives him those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should also ensure that those persons retain the <span class="highlight">rights</span> which they would have had to seek redress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If he has been arrested falsely, if he has been prosecuted maliciously - although this might not be the case in this instance - he has <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He should not be deprived of his <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to whether any compensation may be payable, I feel that the Government’s attitude would be that if people considered that their <span class="highlight">rights</span> had been infringed they, like everyone else, have access  to  the courts of law to assert those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should explain that we will not vote against the second reading because it is important that people who have acted under ordinances of the Australian Capital Territory and other territories, who have acted under regulations under Commonwealth Acts, and who have acted under instruments made by Ministers, should have their <span class="highlight">rights</span> confirmed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If persons find that they were able to escape liabilities or were able to enjoy benefits under laws which everybody thought were valid up until now and now find that that is not the case, the matter should be promptly put to <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They could be put back into a position in which they are in peril again through what is in essence a retrospective piece of legislation affecting vested <span class="highlight">rights</span>, civil liberties, remedies, liabilities, privileges and everything in which we have all been brought up to believe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of the Embassy was to bring to the attention of members of Parliament and others, matters of complaint concerning the welfare of the aboriginal race and in particular their ‘land <span class="highlight">rights</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was a testimony to their peaceful intent in relation to Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We accept that because of the invalidity flowing from this reasoning all manner of cases have gone wrong and legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> have been upset, and these things have to be put right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There should not be laws which affect people in their fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> or which can apply the processes of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, why did the Minister become so obsessed with the desire, by fair means or foul, to remove these people who were carrying on a peaceful demonstration in which they were trying to bring to the attention of members of Parliament not only their needs but also their <span class="highlight">rights</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At public expense he had printed a booklet entitled ‘Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the Northern Territory’, which is merely a liftout from one of the most shocking speeches that has ever been made in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to condemn anybody in the community - ministers of religion and so on - who dared stand up and state what his attitude was to land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the people who have just as much right if not more to live in this country as you and I.  Mr Speaker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister went on in the booklet to draw the red herring of hypocrisy about the fact that certain Aborigines were claiming land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and a total payment of some $6 billion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Minister knew darned well when he put that statement in the booklet that he was misrepresenting the true and proper facts of the whole matter of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Everard Park land <span class="highlight">rights</span> case is a classic example of conflict between the Country Party and the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  was sincere in his speech on Australia Day this year and if he was sincere in what he had to say to the Aboriginal lass that he clasped his arms around in Adelaide during a visit to that city in the winter months about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines he should have challenged the making of this ordinance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps you feel that I am dealing too much with the subject of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The marauders in front of this House at midnight last night did not draw blood, but they may well have drawn blood because of their failure to appreciate the meaning of the basic principle of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has done absolutely nothing, other than use a few words, to put into effect any form of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this House Ministers have done nothing, other than to reply to one or two questions from this side of the House, to indicate the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> position in relation to Everard Park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It might interest honourable members opposite to learn that in door knocking in my electorate I have found to my surprise that the treatment of Aborigines and the denial of their land <span class="highlight">rights</span> by this Government rank as one of the main issues, at least in the minds of the womenfolk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair),  who has charge of the passage of this measure, be prepared to have a proper look at Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and have the subject fully debated? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is high time that we had in power a government that has decent respect for human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, human dignity, the liberty of the subject and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just where do the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of man end or begin, if this is the way you are going to treat this young woman? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a suggestion that the Bill that we are now considering is denying the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the contrary it preserves the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is in order to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those individuals that this Bill is presently before the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we on this side of the Parliament do not believe that the Parliament is the proper body to adjudicate on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and wrongs of these individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its purpose is not to cast into doubt the powers of the courts of this land; its purpose is not to cast into doubt the ability of the magistrates, justices and judges to adjudicate on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and wrongs of individual cases before them; its purpose is to guarantee those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The general question of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individuals who erected their tents in front of Parliament House has been canvassed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that we should recognise that in order to preserve the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those who wish to demonstrate and speak on behalf of minority groups, we are not seeking to remove them from the front of Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, for them to set up their encampment is to deny the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals to demonstrate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But with respect to the other charges and whether they should be pursued, my colleague the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  in another place has said that he believes that Messrs Ambrose Golden-Brown and William James Richard Harrison - 2 of the plaintiffs in the proceedings - might well bc found as having secured for themselves <span class="highlight">rights</span> which should not now be taken from them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, while it is believed that proceedings should be continued against all other persons charged with a variety of offences there is reason to distinguish these persons because of the degree to which they might well be said to have attracted to themselves peculiar <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am assured it is a basis which will not deny any individuals the capacity to rely on the protections that exist within each of these ordinances but rather will protect any <span class="highlight">rights</span> that they may have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing in this Act affects in any way the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liabilities in civil and criminal law of persons charged with offences arising out of incidents outside Parliament House, Canberra on Thursday, 20th July 1972 and Sunday, 23rd July 1972 where those charges or incidents arise out of or are related to the purported notification in the Gazette of 20th July 1972 of the Trespass on Commonwealth Lands Ordinance 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is understandable that in circumstances where the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals are affected there should be deliberate consideration within this Parliament as to whether or not charges against them should be advanced and proceeded with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the basis of my case in rejecting the amendment is not specifically that these offences were different from a breach of the Trespass on Commonwealth Lands Ordinance; it is based on a concern which 1 think every member of this Parliament needs to have about the maintenance of respect for the police force and respect for the observation of laws and for the police in maintaining and protecting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that the list of offences includes a number of offences which go to the very heart of what I would see as and would contend is fundamental if in our society we are to preserve and protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the police are the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual are tremendously important to every man, woman and child in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Four or five years ago some university students decided to hold a vigil in connection with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Government, which has barged through this whole affair over several weeks in an extremely maladroit way, would be well advised to drop it and to stand by its common law <span class="highlight">rights</span> which have been declared for it by the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, because the ordinance that it has drafted is thoroughly unsatisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth might have exercised its ordinary <span class="highlight">rights</span> as owner of the land to remove the tents put there without its authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was therefore felt on this advice that the situation required a specific law which could clearly enable people to identify their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The legislation does not restrict the traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span>, such as the right of freedom of speech and assembly; nor should it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The young man reports that on his return to Australia he received the same address and the same impression as to his equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> when he was in camp at Enoggera. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that with great sincerity, because this Government has for some years now talked to this Parliament about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those who have served this country in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the words of the honourable member for Hawker - probably some excuses ought to be made for the Minister for Repatriation - it is quite obvious that the Government has no regard for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those who served this country in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take this opportunity during the debate on the estimates for the Attorney-General’s Department to give some arguments as to why Australia needs a bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it needs a bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> because the existing safeguards in our laws are no longer sufficient to give full protection to personal civil liberties in an ever changing world which increasingly feels pressures curtailing these civil liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put in another way, it can be said that Australia needs a bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> so that we can enlarge and extend existing areas of freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spokesmen for conservative governments in countries like England and Australia have traditionally argued that there is no need for a bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In saying this, such spokesmen always forget that within the common law itself, charters of individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> have played an important part in the development of the common law and the British Constitution, which rests on the common law and from which Australia draws so many of its values. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Magna Carta, the Petition of Right and the Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> have all been described at times as the pillars of the British Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conservative commentators have also said that these 3 documents and the spirit behind them are sufficient and that they guarantee our <span class="highlight">rights</span> against executive encroachment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The law of civil liberties in the United States of America revolves around the first  10  amendments to the American Constitution which are known collectively as the Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consider how the Austraiian Government’s pressures on the Australian Broadcasting Commission would be more easily resisted if Australia had a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The excessive secrecy that the Australian Government forces on its public servants would more easily be broken down if Australia had a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The efforts of the courts to give protection against such searches and seizures would be made much easier if Australia had a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The power of the courts to give protection against that sort of thing would have been greater if .Australia had a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right not to testify without incurring adverse comment, which will become weaker if the proposed Commonwealth Criminal Code ever becomes a reality, would be easier to protect and preserve if Australia had a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The preservation of the general right to trial by jury, which has largely been lost in Australia, would have been easier to preserve if our High Court had had a proper Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> provision to interpret. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent years many countries have recognised the obvious advantages to be gained by a re-assertion of fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> both from a protective point of view and from an educative point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1960 Canada enacted a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> for Canadians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members should note that the Canadian Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> was passed and became law without one dissenting voice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we in Australia ever get to the stage of moving for a constitutional amendment to enact a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> or to include one in our Constitution, I would hope that the same situation would apply here, I suggest that to argue against a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in such a situation would be something like arguing against the Ten Commandments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, there is probably a distinction to be drawn between personal civil liberties and the dogmatic assertion of economic <span class="highlight">rights</span>, particularly when they apply to great corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are several ways in which a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> could be expressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There could even be an amendment which would be only a rule of construction as in the Canadian Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, which would give way to whatever was the current legislative intent of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the Committee that a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> not only would enlarge greatly the area of civil liberties in Australia, give protection and open up an imaginative new area for the development of Australian constitutional jurisprudence but also would be an important re-assertion of our belief in certain basic values that would have a great effect on the education of all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This gives rise to all sorts of legal consequences, only some of which would be the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those who have been injured both in their persons and in their property to seek redress under the normal law of torts applying throughout the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Freedom of speech and freedom to do everything else must take cognisance of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the innocent people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> business is quite extraordinary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> sounds a wonderful prospect for law and order and so on but does it work? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our founding fathers had to decide whether, in drafting our Constitution, we would adopt constitutional guarantees similar to those in the Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some countries which have adopted a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> with constitutional guarantees have found that the number of cases in the courts endeavouring to enforce constitutional <span class="highlight">rights</span> so guaranteed have accumulated to a point where it takes a very long time for the cases to come on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that those who seek to put their <span class="highlight">rights</span> into the realm of legal guarantee should ask themselves whether they would be giving the citizens a better and higher right than they have under the current system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These ideas are so subtle and complex that they are very difficult to put into a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I think I would rather be living here under the protection of our traditions, our habits of thoughts and our rules of law than under a constitution guaranteeing those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are not a great many of these reports but it was  a  matter of concern, I know, during the period when I was Attorney-General as to whether there should not be some form of appeal where  a  person’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> had been affected by a report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When these people are painting a critical picture with a wide brush they should remember that they are causing embarrassment and ridicule to many thousands of decent and gallant exservicemen without whose efforts in war these people would not enjoy the freedoms and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of criticism in Australia that they do today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That we, the undersigned, protest against the action of the Commonwealth Government in letting the contract for the advertising <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the Victorian pink pages telephone directories to an American company, General Telephone &amp; Electronics Corp., U.S.A., trading in Australia as Directories (Aust.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as some gain from that situation and others are penalised because they do not know about the operations of this tax, I think there is a case for at least some kind of better legal assistance which should be given to people in advance so that they can try to establish what their <span class="highlight">rights</span> are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>refusing to restore land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Aborigines living on reserves or in significant communities; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir Paul  Hasluck, as the relevant Minister, gave it a more humane touch where he said that assimilation meant Aborigines would live at the same standard and have the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> and so forth as Europeans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we were also representatives of this Parliament on the select committee which looked into Aboriginal voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third unanswered question is: Will we change the whole course of our history and acknowledge that any <span class="highlight">rights</span> whatsoever attach to their prior occupancy of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are beginning to acknowledge that there were people with a prior occupancy and therefore they have some <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that rather tragic case before the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory it appears that if the Aborigines had had the forethought to run a wire along the land and to draw a boundary they would have received the same sorts of <span class="highlight">rights</span> as a squatter has, only that they would have been better entitled as squatters from time immemorial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But George III did not need an alliance with the Aborigines in Australia and so no treaty was entered into with them to acknowledge their land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average Australian when he drives past the Aboriginal embassy in Frome Place, Adelaide, sees a crowd of people who evidently make - I stress the word ‘evidently’ because I do not know - no attempt to get a job, who do not come from South Australia anyway and who display a board on which is written: ‘We demand land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think he cited Rhodesia as granting nine-tenths land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the native people of those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst acknowledging the historical significance and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people, this Parliament and this nation must look for the means of helping them most. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I finish on this note: I cannot agree to the Opposition’s list of amendments, most of which I regard as referring to matters which are completely within the sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities of the States to put into effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> has already been dealt with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Land <span class="highlight">rights</span> can be given in this quite affluent society of  ours  to the Aboriginal people living on reserves and in significant communities without causing a violent confrontation with the pastoral industry or with anyone else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody has really yet given a definition of land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us take one of them - land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  speaks about land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the same way as we speak about land for the development of housing, for the development of cattle and sheep stations, sugar production or mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is gratified that the Labor Party has come wholeheartedly to the view that the concept of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> is fundamental to our social conscience and the well being of the Aboriginal people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have debated land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this House so often. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the House are determined that we will do whatever is necessary to satisfy the spiritual longing of the Aboriginal people in regard to land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, that is what we are talking about when we speak about land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should deal with people with a proper sense of dignity and if it is not possible at this stage to get across to the Government the actual spiritual situation in regard to land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, then the members of the Government Parties are a lost cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, despite the rejection by Aborigines, and perhaps in the concept of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the materialistic view of things, we must do something about this in the North. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment refers to the Government’s refusal to restore land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister said that the eventual aim is that Aboriginal Australians should be assisted as individuals, or if they wish, as groups, to hold effective and respected places within one Australian society, with equal access to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and opportunities it provides and acceptance of responsibilities towards it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to say that we recognise the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual Aborigines to effective choice about the degree to which, and the pace at which, they come to identify themselves with the Aboriginal society and that we encourage and assist them to develop their culture, languages, traditions and arts so that these can become living elements in the Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Should we take over all responsibility in relation to Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and mining <span class="highlight">rights</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Have those tribes which were nomadic only a few years ago when the honourable member for Fremantle and 1 were on the House of Representatives Select Committee on Voting <span class="highlight">Rights</span> for Aborigines ceased to be nomadic? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Qantas does not fly from Australia to the west coast of the United States, then to the east coast of the United States and from there to London, other international operators likewise have no <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Australia to fly from America to the east coast of Australia and from there on to Hong Kong or to Thailand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That we, the undersigned, protest against the action of the Commonwealth Government in letting the contract for the advertising <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the Victorian Pink Pages Telephone Directories to an American Company, General Telephone &amp; Electronics Corp.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>God forbid that we should ever come to a stage in this country where, just because the bully boys in the Labor Party with their friends in the media attempt to wield this sort of big stick, people working independently - whether they be in the medical profession or anywhere else - should not stand up for their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and attempt to retain the way of life which they are used to and which they believe is good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I have no doubt that these figures will increase as this position <span class="highlight">rights</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As Leader of the House I am obliged to try to get the business of this House through with the least inconvenience to members  and giving members their full <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s approach in the preparation of the legislation has been to strike a balance between the need to regulate insurance companies and the preservation of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those companies to carry on business in a free enterprise environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other provisions deal with the responsibilities and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of company officers and report by the inspector to the Treasurer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe these to be reasonable and practical criteria which will enable the national interest to be served with the minimum practicable interference in the business community and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of shareholders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the House refused him leave to make a statement because there was insufficient time, but the subsequent discussion about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members has occupied more time than would have been available for the honourable member for Sturt to make his speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It went on to say that the Minister was no match for Country Party Ministers who see Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> demands as being the thin end of the wedge which could threaten existing land ownership in the outback. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the DLP also would have thrown their weight against any suggestion of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The DLP attitude was made quite clear in an article appearing in the Melbourne Herald’ of 7th August which stated that the DLP at its State conference had rejected a motion calling on the Government to recognise land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a shocking thing to say, but at least it proves where the DLP stands in relation to protecting the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can well imagine the brick wall that the Minister must run into when he tries to put up any recommendations of his Department in respect of moves towards Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know that he travelled in that area as a member of the Committee examining Aboriginal voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but that is a long time ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In preserving these we also preserve our national heritage, our way of life and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of every person in this land to enjoy the beauty of the scenery, the landscape and the natural habitat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These people have traditional fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span> and Iceland wishes to extend its fishing limits to 50 miles from the coastline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, it represents a mutually acceptable accommodation of Australia’s and Indonesia’s respective claims to sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> over seabed resources in the area concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second, it will be noted from article 4 that the 2 governments mutually acknowledge the sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> of each government in and over tha seabed within the limits established by this agreement and that they will cease to claim or exercise sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> over natural resources beyond the boundaries now established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The importance of countries’ retaining sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span>, at the very least out to the 200-metre depth line, has been emphasised by Australia in the law of the sea discussions in the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite have no regard for the free <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people in those nations and want to dictate political courses by interference and by asserting their point of view on those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I suggest is that we do not try to intrude the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Parliament, which are very important, into situations where it would be quite silly and inappropriate to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is misleading for honourable members, to confuse the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members of the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Parliament with proper executive procedures which are absolutely essential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>why should not Social Workers make frequent contact with other officers of the Department processing an application to ensure that there is not undue delay, that the application is not bogged down in some sort of bureaucratic inefficiency, and most importantly, to cater for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and entitlements of a client member of the public whose very livelihood and sustenance may, be depending on an early outcome of his application; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our attitude is that we will participate in an examination of the development .of a neutral reserve asset which is currently being called special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> (modified). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an illustration of our attitude let me say that if the Governor of the Reserve Bank were to send to me a notice saying that we were proposing to transfer our reserve currencies into some form of special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span>, I agreed, and they were transferred over, the people of Australia would think that the Government was off its head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have hoped that today the Minister for the Interior would have informed honourable members about the situation and told honourable members how a very prominent member associated with the Liberal Party in South Australia came to lay his hands on this property at a time when the Commonwealth Government was negotiating the purchase of the property, according to the Prime Minister’s statement of 26th February of this year relative to Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Committee stages I will move an amendment to add simply the words ‘or otherwise’ which will make it quite clear that we should take into account or protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of economic wool producers and other organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we are the government after 2nd December we will take immediate steps to bring about the situation for which the wool growers are looking, to protect their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and to give them a feeling of real security instead of the uncertainty which the present Government’s policy fosters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say by way of preface that my right and qualification and all the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Opposition in relation to this measure have been challenged by members on the Government side and by the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>State governments have particular <span class="highlight">rights</span> and all of them are getting in for their pound of flesh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask that question because of the very sorry spectacle of what happened in regard to Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, if I may use that term, as the Government sees them as illustrated by the speech of the Prime Minister on 26th January this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>further than that, any land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aborigines in areas adjacent to their own properties? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government now stands in a position of having to reveal its sincerity in regard to Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this particular property acquisition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already referred to the statement in relation to the concept of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> which was made by the Prime Minister on 26th January of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of the Department of the Interior to Aboriginal affairs and Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the attitude displayed by the Department of the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts are somewhat different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party will not accept this open ended proposition whereby apparently the States can add to the criteria already laid down by somebody in the Commonwealth Treasury or the Commonwealth Cabinet whereby there is an air of uncertainty regarding the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of creditors, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of State water authorities, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of mortgagees, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other people who happen to be owed money by the farmers and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of war service land settlers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Dawson referred in more general form to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of mortgagees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill that we dealt with a few moments ago does not interfere with the legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> of mortgagees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although it provides wideranging benefits, this Act does not extend to its beneficiaries the advantages of appeal <span class="highlight">rights</span> to either War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunals or War Pensions Assessment Appeal Tribunals, or the payment of war pension in respect of non-war related pulmonary tuberculosis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It preserves the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of ex-servicemen, formerly members of the Torres Strait Light Infantry Forces, who will now be brought under the provisions of the Repatriation Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, because of the geographic location of the Torres Strait Islands, their remoteness, and the limitations of sea transportation between the islands, this time limit has been extended to 6 months for persons resident in the Torres Strait Islands, so that no member will be disadvantaged in respect of the exercise of his <span class="highlight">rights</span> of appeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important to the persons who will benefit therefrom and who will henceforth enjoy the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> under the same legislation as all Australians who were members of the defence forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I could never understand why Torres Strait Islanders shoud be denied the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other exservicemen in respect of war service homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, as I think most honourable members believe to be the case, the Commonwealth Grants Commission has examined and continues to examine in some detail all of the submissions made to it by the relevant States under those and other headings it would be hard to sustain the argument that the Commission and through it the Government are neglectful of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and rightful needs of a State such as Tasmania and, of course, not only Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are made to feel, by what honourable members opposite say, thai they have no <span class="highlight">rights</span> left and that they should not be in a position to take action to remedy these things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among other things, this has the effect of restoring to any seamen involved, all <span class="highlight">rights</span> accruing under the Act, including the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to have their cases referred to a compensation tribunal or to make application to a prescribed court for judicial review of their claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At present, the State governments also claim sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this same area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are we to be able to act as a nation, or as 6 States which have another government negotiating for them but necessarily bound by the <span class="highlight">rights</span> those other 6 governments claim? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Now we read that the Tasmanian Government has given what are reported to be exclusive fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span>’ in waters where Commonwealth fishing laws apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The right honourable member for Higgins mentioned a decision which apparently has been taken by a State government to give exclusive fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span> to a foreign company to operate in Australian waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present laws as they relate to Australian waters - the 3- mile limit, the territorial limit, the fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span>) - will have to be looked at thoroughly at the United Nations convention next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many other countries, particularly in Latin America, already have made unilateral decisions regarding changes in the breadth of the territorial sea as it relates to fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the limits of the outer continental shelf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was irrelevant -  that sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> in respect of the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the Continental Shelf contiguous to the coast of the States are wholly within State authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In what other place but Australia and under a government such as this could we have a situation as is defined in the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act where a sovereign national Parliament agrees not to exert its sovereign national <span class="highlight">rights</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then there is the question of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Where there is an ILO requirement for State legislation, where there is in practice a requirement for Human <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation by the States, where is the co-operation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important for Australia to assert its <span class="highlight">rights</span> to fisheries, to the sea bed, and to the riches of the sea bed and of the territorial sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In what shape is our nation, in what shape is the present Government or any future government at international conferences when it is dealing with these resources and with transit <span class="highlight">rights</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question that agitates the mind of every loyal Australian is just to what extent he will reap the benefits of his own national birthright; whether this Government, running true to form, will endeavour to see that the full fruits of it go to private enterprise, or whether a national government is prepared to exercise its undoubted <span class="highlight">rights</span> to construct a natural gas pipeline to be a common carrier and, more than that, whether it is prepared to assert its authority over the continental shelf and in particular the deposits within the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such frustrations are natural and must build up pressure within the armed forces for action, irrespective of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or wrongs of the conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#debate-9">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was done in the case of Bell Bay in Tasmania and there is no reason why it could not be done in the case of the Government Aircraft Factories so that the senior personnel in the industry could rest assured that their accrued <span class="highlight">rights</span> for superannuation and other benefits, to which their service entitles them, would be protected should the industry be rationalised or should a merger take place whereby it would no longer be a government operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#debate-9">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I might say that the honourable member is way off when he talks in such terms of the current Minister, because it is my understanding that the present Minister for Repatriation cannot claim any praise for his handling of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and benefits of ex-servicemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The tragedy of the nationalised scheme is that the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the freedoms and the humanity of patients are sacrificed to suit the inhuman tidiness of the doctrinaire and bureaucratic mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Granting voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> to these people was something that the previous government at various times, when challenged by the Labor Party in opposition to take action, mouthed support for, but that Government was never prepared to take forthright action to introduce this very necessary electoral reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without getting on to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or wrongs of a change in the boundary between Queensland and Papua New Guinea, I want to make one point on this issue this evening, and I am sure that those who have looked closely at the situation will agree with the point that I make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there has been some strong evidence documented in various articles, and never satisfactorily rebutted in this place in the course of the last Parliament, that some members in the new Opposition who were members of the then Government, and who even were Ministers, who if not card-carrying members of that extreme right wing organisation, the Australian League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, certainly gave succour and support to that organisation and made no apologies about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I said that his appointment would be a matter that would test my strength of character; it would show whether I had the courage to stand up against men who would besmirch a man and who would determine that he and people like him have no real <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of what the honourable member said about <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and I know what he feels about that matter, I put it to the House that no individual has a right to examine a secret and confidential document which is the property of a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was the day on which the then Government sold out to another power the sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it very hard to accept this proposal, despite the good humoured way in which the Leader of the House has presented it, as being anything other than an attempt by the Government to erode the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By suspending this standing order or another standing order the Government can whittle away the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of an Opposition and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members and make the Parliament completely subservient to the majority party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No-one knows the facts better than I. I had to move the suspension of Standing Orders in the last Parliament on a number of occasions because of the attitudes expressed by the Opposition when it was then in Government and its deliberate moves to remove the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual members of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was it not the Opposition, when it was in Government, which refused honourable members their <span class="highlight">rights</span>, when it carried a motion in this House suspending the right to move for the suspension of Standing Orders? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that no other government ever took away from private members more of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this Parliament than did those who sit opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the House to support the motion and give away one minute in the interests of restoring democracy to the Parliament and  maintaining the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members to vote here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is quite mindful of the need to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No honourable member appreciates the position of private members more than the members of the present Government because we were at the receiving end of what I would describe as the most torrid Government in the history of this country in respect of the taking away of members <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is pledged to support the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members and it is making adequate provision for adjournment debates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When honourable members opposite talk about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members they should remember that there are a few skeletons that are well worth rattling in their old cupboards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that no other members of Australian Parliaments ever took away more of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members - as the figures I have given show - than did members of the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a tremendous irony it is that a Leader of the House should come before this chamber seeking to restrict the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members to participate in a full examination of issues during the course of an adjournment debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if it is true - and the honourable member for Scullin apparently feels it to be so - it is important to see in what way members of Parliament can protect their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member for Scullin believes, as he apparently does, that there is an erosion already of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members of this Parliament, how little it becomes him now to support a measure that will restrict those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assure the Government that it has a long and impassable road ahead if it persists in pursuing unconstitutional attacks on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the sovereign State of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response and in return for that assistance, which I might add has not been forthcoming in all other parts of the world, governments of Australia have ignored their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations to protect employees in those industries which have been so affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the past generation previous governments have created and have encouraged this depersonalised society in which the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals are cheap, in which individuals count for little and in which all that counts is the number of dollars and cents that were made in each year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government intends to press for the establishment of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, far better health services and better nutritional standards for Aborigines so thu no longer will they be the poverty-stricken section of this Australian community with one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To them is a person a security risk only because at some time he might have been a communist or even had membership, say, of a youth organisation such as the Eureka Youth League or might have had some association along the line with someone who has what is commonly termed pinkish tendencies, or do the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> or the National Civic Council or any of these organisations which are popular with some of the other members opposite come into the picture? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ever ready to denounce the denial of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Russia, China, North Vietnam and other communist countries, the former Government was noticeably reluctant to apply the same yardstick to South Africa, Rhodesia, Greece, Spain, Portugal and the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For a country which once led the world in granting <span class="highlight">rights</span> to women about the time this Parliament was established we have often since lagged behind the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This House can make a significant contribution to <span class="highlight">rights</span> for women by, among other things, passing legislation to provide much better adult education facilities, to establish equal pay for work of equal value, to provide for family planning clinics, to build child care centres and to reform those laws which discriminate against women both socially and financially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want water conservation plans updated to ensure the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the municipalities and the people within them and a guarantee that there will be no retardation of their natural growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hand in hand with these negotiations must go a beginning to the task of reforming the world currency system - a move, perhaps, towards something in the nature of an ‘SDR standard” or special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> standard - if some measure of stability in exchange rates, albeit with a greater flexibility than now, is to be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the limits of our Australian Constitution the Federal Government will need the co-operation of all States if we are to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and national inheritance of future generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will work in this Parliament and in my electorate as a member of a government which is pledged to work for equal opportunity in education for Australian children; greater employment opportunities; a better deal for pensioners; a real attack on poverty; a proud and progressive Australia a vote for the 18-year-olds in the community and recognition of the status and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some honourable members opposite certainly have not forgotten about the State when it comes to criticising that great Queenslander, Joh Bjelke Petersen, who, as a great defender, has safeguarded the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a small section of Queenslanders whom the Labor Party seeks to steamroll into Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Advance notice is served that I am totally opposed to the centralisation of power in Canberra by the devious method of eroding the powers, and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual - and this is surely the most sacred right of all - and attempting to destroy the State and local authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We paved the way for a better deal for Aborigines, to give them the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> which they have justly and rightly deserved for a long while and upon which question the previous Government see-sawed and wavered because it was afraid of offending big business in this country, of which it was the servant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If, for reasons of national interest, changes have to take place and people have to be disemployed, that will be done with proper protection and with proper <span class="highlight">rights</span> to retraining  - things that the previous Government apparently never thought of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#debate-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again, this is going to be a difficult matter to resolve, lt will not be terribly difficult to define the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people in regard to existing reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By effectively seeking to assign pre-conditions of union membership in the letting of Government contracts the Government is effectively denying these <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only do they cut directly across the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual workers, but they introduce dangerous practices that can subvert the time honoured system followed in these matters where there have been no allegations of abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course it wants the money, but the Victorian Minister is putting up a fight for certain <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main principle is the freedom and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual which they consider to be superior to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We do not want sympathy; we do not want anything other than our <span class="highlight">rights</span> as  Her  Majesty’s Opposition to express a point of view, and we intend to fight for these <span class="highlight">rights</span> if we feel that we have been treated in an inadequate fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that in the future he will do his job properly without seeing a necessity to buffoon and try to ridicule and belittle people, some of whom are perhaps not as adequately equipped as he is to stand up for their <span class="highlight">rights</span> but simply are people sincerely trying to do a job which they have been sent by the people who have elected them to this Parliament to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What worried me so much as a South Australian was that we had thought that the previous Liberal -Country League Premier of South Australia had succeeded in negotiating certain water <span class="highlight">rights</span> for South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We thought that he had negotiated and obtained greater water <span class="highlight">rights</span> for South Australia from the yield of the River Murray. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be noted that these States are leaders in extending voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> in line with increasing responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These States, jealous of their State <span class="highlight">rights</span> and justice, would seem justified in demanding votes at Federal elections for their enfranchised under their State laws, but section 41 of the Federal Constitution states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fortunate that this Bill we are now debating can remove the anachronism and the anomaly of depriving 18-year-olds of voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> while demanding of them adult responsibilities,, rather than having to go to the people to change the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By 18 most young people are ready for these responsibilities and <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and would greatly profit by them, as would the teaching authorities, the business community, the administration of justice and the community as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those 18-year- olds will fee] that their <span class="highlight">rights</span> are being neglected or ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The arguments for lowering the voting age are strong, be they based on social, legal or civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former Government at no time expressed itself as being opposed to the provision of voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the 18, 19 and 20-year-olds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the franchise age issue could have been dealt with separately, a variety of other legal issues surrounding the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of 18, 19 and 20-year-olds needed the closest scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They wanted to concern themselves about things such as Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although we accept the premise contained in this legislation that a person is more mature and indeed is able to exercise full franchise <span class="highlight">rights</span> at 18, we do not extend that to the whole, concept of adulthood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reduction of the age of majority and the age at which voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> are gained is not the conscientious matter it was even 5 years ago when only a few honourable members this side of the House were prepared to support the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a time when arguments in favour of voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> for women and Aborigines were also rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, apart from voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the questions of the age of marriage without consent, the age to contract, and matters relating to interests under wills and settlements have all to be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The table shows some of the countries that have extended voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> to citizens 18 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My message to the Minister is that the people who have to vote should be educated in the exercise of their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the questions of adulthood by which the relations of unconnected persons are affected are: the age of legal responsibility for con.tractural and proprietary <span class="highlight">rights</span>; the question of domicile and citizenship; the age at which certain social freedoms are permitted; the age at which marriage is permitted without parental consent; the age of responsibility in industrial matters; and age limitations in respect of financial legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill extends citizenship <span class="highlight">rights</span> to those in the high schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that a deal of simulated emotion on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of young people to vote does not really carry the argument forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As part of the Commonwealth Parliament, we should promote changes in the law over which the Commonwealth has control to give these adults full <span class="highlight">rights</span>, obligations, liabilities and responsibilities in matters such as the making of contracts and wills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps we should consider making the age of 18 the cut-off date and raise to 18 years the age limit in respect of certain <span class="highlight">rights</span> such as the obtaining of a drivers licence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, we should not be looking at this as a piecemeal matter and as something to pander to the demands which have been made strongly by a few in the community but we should say that 18 years of age is to be the age of adulthood and therefore 1 8-year-olds must accept all the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of adulthood in Australia and all the responsibilities that go with being an Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, mindful of its mandate and responsibility, is determined to ensure that the Australian electoral laws embrace those fundamental principles of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and democracy in this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, equality of political <span class="highlight">rights</span> is inherent in a truly democratic State and these <span class="highlight">rights</span> must be indisputably safeguarded by the legislature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives to those who sit in this Parliament the opportunity to say whether they believe in these democratic principles and the equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all electors, or whether they stand for manipulation of the Electoral Act to retain governments of their political colour irrespective of the vote of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We firmly believe that all citizens should have equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations under the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As such, Aborigines should be assisted to hold effective and respected places within one Australian society with equal access to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and opportunities it provides and acceptance of responsibilities towards it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had a long campaign before free and equal voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> were obtained for Aboriginal people, and the Queensland Government was the last to surrender on that account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in reply - In closing this brief debate on this measure, I express my appreciation first to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Bryant)  for his words of congratulation and also his passionate attachment, as on all occasions, to equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> for all of our citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  findings, however, will be the basis upon which the Commonwealth will act not only in the Northern Territory, not only in the Jervis Bay territory at places such as Wreck Bay, but also in the States where the Aborigines are still exercising traditional land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are determined to see that there will be non-alienable nontransferable <span class="highlight">rights</span> vested in the Aborigines in respect of the land which they have traditionally occupied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me borrow the words of the immediate past Secretary-General of the United Nations Organisation who said in a declaration made on Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Day in 1966: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its removal in no way advances the very basic and serious question of a woman’s role and her <span class="highlight">rights</span> which must be pursued, and pursued as a matter of urgency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When considering controls and regulations, the important factor is to see that basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> and reasonable freedom of action are not infringed unduly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do not accept the proposition put up now that anyone who opposes ZPG is in fact attacking women’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But on the same basis I also object to the proposition that to oppose the principle of ZPG is somehow an attack on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government recognises the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual Aborigines to effective choice about the degree to which and the pace at which they come to identify themselves with that Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt is also necessary to have agreements between these 2 nations that will protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people of the Torres Straits to live on their own islands, have title to their own land and retain Australian citizenship with all that that means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we must maintain for these people such <span class="highlight">rights</span> as 1 mentioned of retaining their citizenship and living on their islands, we must also consider the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people of Papua New Guinea, given that a continuing continental shelf runs between the 2 nations, to some share in the resources of the seabed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister said, inter alia, that the Government was ‘impressed by the potentialities of the question’ - he was referring to the boundary - ‘as a source of friction between Australia and an emerging Papua New Guinea’, but was also very mindful of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and interests of the Torres Strait Islanders’; and was therefore proposing ‘discussions … in January between officials of the Papua New Guinea Government, your Government’ - that is, the Queensland Government - ‘and my Government (including the Office of Aboriginal Affairs)’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs mentioned in his second reading speech, this Government has appointed  Mr Justice  Woodward to examine the question of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Northern Territory in order to ascertain how in each individual situation, we can best vest these lands in the hands of the Aboriginal people who live in these communities and reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But on the question of the constitutional <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people there is no doubt that the Parliament has absolute and complete constitutional powers and an absolute mandate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the ways in which we can do this is to recognise that Aboriginal people are distinctive, that they have their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and that these <span class="highlight">rights</span> ought to be respected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister was quite within his <span class="highlight">rights</span> to give the answer that he did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the ‘<span class="highlight">Rights</span> for Territorians’ meeting as it was called should have been described as a demand for an inquiry into the running of Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I should like to mention land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, which is a practical problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The acquisition of this land is a practical approach to the problem of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in which these people are interested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The constitutional right of the Commonwealth to legislate for the Aboriginal people was established in 1967 in a referendum in which the people of Australia voted overwhelmingly in favour of Commonwealth <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>as an Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> commissioner to make a report on the best means of achieving the Government’s aims in this area, and, in doing so, the Government is only falling into line with what has been done in a number of other countries which have had to face the injustices that have been done to their indigenous people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may interest Government supporters to recall that Article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> provides that everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and further provides that no-one can be compelled to belong to an association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a constant debating point to suggest that in Australia there is a constitutional guarantee underpinning citizen <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basically, what we confront in Australia is the monarchical idea that all people are simply subjects and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> that they obtain have to be deliberately conferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

    <p>To the contrary its members would be failing in their duty if they did not fight with all their power to protect the limited <span class="highlight">rights</span> of country people and to give them, to the maximum possible degree, something at least approaching equality of representation to which they, as Australian citizens are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People in any other country would consider that we had taken leave of our senses, lost our sense of perspective and lost all sense of reality if in our circumstances we asserted that to pay some limited regard to these factors was in some way perpetrating an intolerable outrage on the democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the vast majority of the population who live cheek by jowl in a handful of metropolitan cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My attitude as an elected representative is that the electoral <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people of Australia are paramount and these must receive proper consideration if we are to suggest that the electoral system of this nation is a democratic one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that, because of the gerrymander that has taken place in Queensland, because electorate loading has been permitted under sections of the Electoral Act and because there has been an attack on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of city people, there has been a reaction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I repeat what I said earlier: Although all the people in the cities did not vote for me, I will be standing up as I am today, demanding the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people who live in the cities and demanding that the value of their vote be the same as that of people living in country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Equality of political <span class="highlight">rights</span> is inherent in any truly democratic system and these <span class="highlight">rights</span> must be safeguarded by the legislature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The views that he expressed in his maiden speech were the views of the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> and it is surprising and deplorable to me that people with views such as those should receive even 8,000 votes in any electorate in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we realise that some tolerance is essential, this legislation certainly will help to break down the wide disparity that exists now between the various electorates in our Federal system and bring about a system that gives equal voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> to every elector, irrespective of what he is, what he does or where he lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have seen the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Murphy)  wanting an FBItype political police force for himself, and now tonight we have the last straw from the last bastion of democracy that I thought we had in this place, the Minister for Services and Property, who when on this side of the House used to make great speeches about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual members of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition to providing for continuation of payments to pensioners wherever they choose to live outside Australia, the provisions introduced by this Bill will also allow a social security pensioner living overseas, if he wishes and is otherwise eligible, to transfer to a repatriation Service pension, or vice versa, thus giving him the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this respect as would be available to him in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australian pension benefits outside of this country - a pensioner has in general to have been resident in Australia for at least 20 years after reaching the age of 16 and additionally can only attract portability <span class="highlight">rights</span> in 4 countries: Italy, Greece, Turkey and Malta. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Pensioners receiving their pensions in Malta, Italy, Greece and Turkey in accordance with the reciprocal pension portability agreements entered into under the legislation introduced by the previous Government will not only have their existing <span class="highlight">rights</span> preserved but will be brought within the new provisions that is they will be able to continue to receive their Australian pensions but the requirement that they live in one of the 4 countries mentioned will no longer apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was, of course, an opportunity for the Leader to speak in the Grievance Day debate this morning, if he chose to displace the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members in that respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These functions included a wide range of community services and State functions and a lot of control over many forms of social legislation including, for example, workers compensation, gambling, censorship, consumer protection, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of women, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of minors, daylight saving and control of firearms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The discussions over which I presided in a period of less than 2 years have borne fruit and on 25th October I felt that we had reached the stage when the time was not too far off when we would be able to salute the people of the Territory as people with the same State <span class="highlight">rights</span> as those in the other States of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am rising tonight to protest at the deliberate attacks that have been made by this Government on the interests and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of country people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By asserting our confidence in the AttorneyGeneral we are also asserting our own undoubted and unchallengeable <span class="highlight">rights</span> as members of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the meantime, I wish to make it quite clear that no Australian citizen will be deported, and that there will be no abridgment whatsoever of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of any Australian resident in the execution of deportation orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today the Prime Minister in his statement had to undo the harm done by that statement when he talked about deportation not occurring to Australian citizens or there being no abridgement of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australian residents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Private members’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> were infringed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my experience the use of legal definition of accident, injury or disease has been such that the workers have not received their proper <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased that this legislation will remove that terrible impost on a worker trying to establish his <span class="highlight">rights</span> to workers compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though there may be joint rolls, that in no way infringes upon the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a State government to make its own decisions regarding redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter we are now debating deeply concerns the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Bradfield  (Mr Turner)  - colleague and friend of us all - is a man who has constantly stood up for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is that this Bill provides for all, regardless of origins, the same requirements as to residence, good character, knowledge of the language and of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and duties of citizenship, and intention to live here permanently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, overseas pension <span class="highlight">rights</span> are almost personal property like an insurance policy or any other investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are different in kind, therefore, from <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Australia which are not tied to personal and individual contributions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it did nothing to protect the pension <span class="highlight">rights</span> coming from overseas of people who had left their home countries to settle in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not in any way give us the power to negotiate with other countries in order to protect the pension <span class="highlight">rights</span> accruing from overseas of people who have come to settle permanently in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the amendment and, of course, the general proposition that there should be general portability of pensions: but I hope that the greater availability to pension <span class="highlight">rights</span> to anybody who wishes to leave this country will not lead to abuse of what is a right and privilege for those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also hope that by the Government making it easier for people to leave Australia and to take certain <span class="highlight">rights</span> with them the general pride and dignity in being an Australian and wanting to remain in Australia will not be lessened in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer here to concessions on television and radio licences, concessions on telephone services and certain <span class="highlight">rights</span> in relation to the pensioner medical service and pensioner hospital benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They could, for instance, draw an Australian pension here and as a result of portability <span class="highlight">rights</span> overseas could draw, for instance, a United Kingdom pension, a West German pension or a pension from any one of a number of countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clause has the effect, which I know the Minister did not intend, of taking away from certain pensioners in Australia <span class="highlight">rights</span> which they possess at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts are that, for instance, a person travelling overseas after the enactment of this Bill will be able to take his Australian pension <span class="highlight">rights</span> overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Labor Government should consider going to the people on a referendum, a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> for the people of Australia, which will include in it an assurance that each legislature in Australia provides a guarantee to each citizen of universal and equal suffrage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the States in which the Liberal and Country parties have control continue to deny to the people of those States their <span class="highlight">rights</span> there is only one possible answer: We must go to a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again there was an effort to capitalise superannuation <span class="highlight">rights</span> but this could be regarded in a similar way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is sufficient to say that it has had a major role in promoting the acceptance and application of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in such areas as abolishing forced labour, promoting freedom of association and removing discrimination in employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He indicated that priority attention was being given to those conventions dealing with fundamental human <span class="highlight">rights</span> which Australia had not ratified at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of the other 2 amendments adopted in 1964, one provided for the suspension from participation in the International Labour Conference of any ILO member State which had been found by the United Nations to be flagrantly and persistently pursuing by its legislation a declared policy of racial discrimination such as apartheid and the other for the expulsion from the ILO or suspension from the exercise of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of membership of the ILO of any member which the United Nations had suspended from the exercise of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of membership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This agreement superseded a similar agreement entered into in 1949, the year after the Australian and New Zealand governments acquired the mining <span class="highlight">rights</span> from the Christmas Island Phosphate Co. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision in this legislation which gives the ex-serviceman the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> as would be available to him if he resided in Australia, as I have said before is to be commended, for this in some small part shows that the ex-serviceman is recognised for the service that he gave to this country and that this service is appreciated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that a person is born in this country ought to give him some entitlement no matter where he goes, no matter what he does, no matter how long he is away from this country and that ought to be part of the general acceptance of our citizenship and <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore those <span class="highlight">rights</span> which flow to a person while he is resi dent in this country ought in ordinary circumstances apply when he is away from this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a very sorry episode for the status of new Australians who have taken unto themselves, with natural born Australians, the responsibility of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The oppressive operation of rent controls has for a long time transferred property <span class="highlight">rights</span> in housing from the owner who financed it to the tenant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I state this because before the defeat of the Australian Labor Party Government in Queensland in 1957 rents were controlled and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of tenants were safeguarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he, instruct the Australian Ambassador to Yugoslavia to establish beyond question that in each case the deportees have not been executed, have not been incarcerated for political crimes, or suspicion of them, and are being treated in accordance with the principles embodied in the Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Prime Minister’s keen and stated interest in the representations on public lending <span class="highlight">rights</span> from the Australian Society of Authors, I ask him whether the Government is currently examining the proposition by authors . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we ought to get from the Government, if it treats this seriously, is a firm statement that in the future if any Australian citizens are arrested in Yugoslavia, brought to trial in Yugoslavia, sought to be punished in Yugoslavia, this Government ought to be informed immediately that takes place so that it can take care of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those people according to Australian law, so that they are properly represented, so that they are not railroaded to the kind of death to which these 3 men have been railroaded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was a complaint about the Government’s failure to assert and protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australian citizens in Yugoslavia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of public Importance that people who are Australian citizens have been killed overseas in these circumstances, but the rest of the charges made by the honourable member for Moreton concerning the subordination of the Australian Government’s obligations to assert and protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of its citizens overseas are appropriate and apt only in relation to the conduct, the reputation and behaviour of the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems incredible,  Mr Speaker,  that to date representatives of welfare organisations such as the Young Men’s Christian Association, the Salvation Army, the Australian Comforts Fund, the Young Women’s Christian Association and the Australian Red Cross Society that served in all theatres of war with distinction, such as North Africa, Greece, Crete, Papua New Guinea, Malaya and Singapore, have not been recognised and given the opportunity to participate and have the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> as a returned person under the War Service Homes Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely then these people who were under no obligation to go to war are entitled to the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges as the returned serviceman or service woman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These national servicemen will have the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> as those Australians who served in the rotten conditions in New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another provision recognises the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of single females to own their homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the matter put to me by the honourable member for Herbert does not involve prerogative; it involves <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to see more <span class="highlight">rights</span> as against discretion put into this legislation as quickly as it is reasonable to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, did he also note that the claim was made that conservatism on the part of Australian agricultural marketing boards has cost both Australian consumers and farmers the full benefits of the breakthrough and that, consequently, CSIRO has assigned licensing <span class="highlight">rights</span> to an Anglo-American controlled company? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet in respect of these 2 ships the Minister for Transport, a Minister of a Labor Government which claims to champion the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people, did not tell the Parliament that the maximum  subsidy  offered by the new Labor Government was only 25 per cent, the bottom of the barrel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In regard to Wednesday mornings, I think it is an important factor that 90 Bills are being introduced in this session of Parliament and, in fairness to the public and democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span>, all of these require close attention and study clause by clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Firstly, the Government believes that it ought to be possible to appoint 7 commissioners to run TAA, instead of 6 as at present, and that the Act should enable the General Manager to be appointed as a commissioner, with the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities as other commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be thought that amendment (iv) which deals with the academic progress of students assisted by way of grant, loan or by any other means, impinges on the individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> of students assisted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been a long time coming, but we now have a government which accepts no constitutional inhibitions and which will place our <span class="highlight">rights</span> and duties to the citizenry of Australia before any theology, including State <span class="highlight">rights</span> or constitutional precedence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the use of statutory drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> may be the alternative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other main elements of the Committee’s view were, third, that the SDR - Special Drawing <span class="highlight">Rights</span> - should become the principal reserve asset of a reformed system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This arrangement of Special Drawing <span class="highlight">Rights</span> is not a cloak cup- board affair like the ordinary drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Fund where no more comes out than is put in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It could help educate our young people in such areas of industrial relations informing them of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> under the laws and their obligations under the laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view, this represents a denial of <span class="highlight">rights</span> to certain young Australians and it is these <span class="highlight">rights</span> which have been ignored by previous governments which have had a preponderance of people who professed to represent the needs of persons from rural electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under that Bill its members had <span class="highlight">rights</span> to workers compensation, weekly payments, lump sum payments and recognition of compensation for specific injuries or disease, none of which is now recognised because of the delay in dealing with this legislation which was passed unopposed in this House 2 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The action they should be encouraged to take is to teach a lesson to those members in the other place who are prepared to deny <span class="highlight">rights</span> to others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>History clearly demonstrates the need to have measures in the legislation to protect the democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of union members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose he is looking after the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the role of the trade unionists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Australia is to have collective bargaining, let the legislation plainly and unmistakably spell it out, together with the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, obligations and privileges of the participants and the protection for the public from the monopoly power of unions and of employers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also mentioned the inclusion in the Bill of provisions to give greater <span class="highlight">rights</span> of entry to union officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Opposition have always been loud in their concern for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the rank and file trade unionist, although whether they have been sincere in this is another matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions in this Bill give effect to that platform as they refer to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and safeguards of the individual member of a union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the great  Mr Burke  wrote: ‘Men cannot enjoy the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a civil and uncivil state together*. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they were brought out to listen to the Minister speaking in defence of individuals like the honourable member for Moreton, it would be legitimate for people to defend their own <span class="highlight">rights</span> in considering what they had to consider in terms of legitimate union business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They do in respect of the ownership of property, they do in exercising property <span class="highlight">rights</span>; they do in exercising certain other statutory obligations and requirements which are set out in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act; but they do not and they should not be seen to be standing in the shoes of the membership in relation to the negotiation of an agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He would not, without breaching his commission and his oath of office, certify an agreement which, as it were, took away the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of one section of the community or infringed upon the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other sections of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main cause today of industrial disputes is failure to consult - management standing on the so-called sacred <span class="highlight">rights</span> of managerial prerogatives and saying that the worker is nothing but a servant, that the manager is the master, that the old 18th century relationship between master and servant still survives and that no spiritual, temporal or any other power of the Parliament, unions or anybody else should interfere with this long-established but longoutmoded so-called right of managerial prerogatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Everybody recognises and acknowledges the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of employees and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be none, ff all persons in the community are to be equal before the law and to have equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> before the law, they must also have equal obligations before the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be said that we on this side are the ones who, in this case, are seeking to uphold the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals, be they members of a union, be they employees, be they any other members of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Government which is seeking to take away established <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals in Australia, <span class="highlight">rights</span> which have been, as I have said, with Australia and with the people, apart from Queensland, for the whole of this century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to bring down a blanket of this character and say that the entire Committee stage of the Bill has to be concluded by 3.15 p.m. appears to me to be a complete denial of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this House and a contempt for this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I warn the honourable member that a continuance of this conduct may force us to adopt the tactics which the previous Government did and that will restrict completely the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of honourable members opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The French Government’s action in continuing nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere in the Pacific is contrary to the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> which states that all people ‘should act towards one another in the spirit of brotherhood’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under our democratic system the people have a number of basic and inalienable <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most significant of those <span class="highlight">rights</span> is that of the concept and application of Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those people it is of special significance to become an Australian and to be vested with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges which that concept entails. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proper and desirable that a new settler who has become an Austraiian should not be treated differently from any other Australian with respect to voting and other <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These include reasonable and uniform periods of residence, good character, knowledge of the language, <span class="highlight">rights</span>, privileges and duties of citizenship and an honest intention to make Australia a permanent home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The considerable body of scientific and technological expertise now existing in Australia has much to contribute to the achievements of acceptable balances between the needs and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of consumers on the one hand and the problems of manufacturers on the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is that this Bill provides for all, regardless of origins, the same requirements as to residence, good character, knowledge of the language and of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and duties of citizenship, and intention to live here permanently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It preserves the inalienable <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals as human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  in his deliberate attempts toward centralism, has suggested that all appeals to the Privy Council be no longer heard, completely disregarding the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in Queensland, whilst upset at the cavalier attempts of the Prime Minister to downgrade in a rather facetious manner the forthcoming visit to the United Kingdom of the honourable Jo Bjelke-Petersen, the Premier of Queensland, know that our State will have its constitutional <span class="highlight">rights</span> safeguarded by the appeal of our Premier to the authorities to have the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of our federal system preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is that this Bill provides for all, regardless of origin, the same requirements as to residence, good character, knowledge of the language and of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and duties of citizenship and intention to live here permanently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An examination of the 2 quotes surely will provide the answer that the latter position should be so, as it is implied in the first quote that the number of years is not the only yardstick or criterion but other factors are included, such as knowledge of the language and of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the duties of citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An erstwhile citizen of Australia is relieved of all the legal obligations of Australian citizenship and, of course, he loses the <span class="highlight">rights</span> that accrue with that Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clearly in the interest of Australia that our grant of citizenship be an exclusive one, that our political <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations be the only ones to which naturalised Australian citizens are subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Steps are open to the Australian Government to try to ensure that our naturalised citizens enjoy the full <span class="highlight">rights</span> that our other Australian citizens enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say all these things to show that the image that the Opposition is trying to create - of preferment and compatibility, of the supposed exchange of <span class="highlight">rights</span> between the United Kingdom and the Australian Governments - is false. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only basis 1 can see on which we can do away with this requirement of renunciation in taking an oath or affirmation is a resolution of that problem with each of the countries which today fail to recognise what we see as the privileges and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of an Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not an issue in respect of which anybody would agree that all the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or wrongs are on one side or the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a 4 to 3 decision the Court held the statute unconstitutional on 2 principal grounds: Firstly, that the phrase ‘Necessary to preserve life’ was so vague as to be violative of the due process requirements for a criminal law, and, secondly, that the law was in violation of a woman’s fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> to life and to choose whether to bear children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The critical issue defined by the California Supreme Court was whether the state had any legitimate interest in the regulation of abortion which would justify so deep an infringement of the fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> of women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Afraid of prosecution and uncertain of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> under the law some doctors are refusing women an abortion when they are in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliaments have not protected all the <span class="highlight">rights</span> involved when they force women to bear children against their will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This lack of freedom of choice cannot be accepted by people who respect basic individual <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I warn this wholly male House that it is because we are males there is a great danger that we will ignore the needs and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of women in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to confine one’s thinking to this single absolutist principle is to ignore the many other <span class="highlight">rights</span> inherent in the situation, such as the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to health and welfare of the mother and her existing family, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to choose whether to bear children or not and the right of the child to be wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who accept without question the ‘right to life’ of the foetus must examine their consciences and answer for the desperate misery and hardship imposed upon pregnant women, the existence of illicit abortionists, the hypocrisy of a law that is different for rich and poor, and the confusion that faces doctors as to their medical <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And those who deny the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of life to the foetus at any stage of its development without thorough examination and conviction do so at the peril of encouraging disrespect for life, legalised by the state, which is the most fundamental of al) <span class="highlight">rights</span> and which is basic to all other <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principle of the right to life and its relation to other <span class="highlight">rights</span> is the reason why there is so much emotion and controversy in the abortion debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is however a sea of controversy amongst theologians, the medical fraternity and the public as to when, during that continuum, the foetus should be granted <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The validity of <span class="highlight">rights</span> is only as strong as the powers that protect them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Rights</span> can only be realised when they are exercised, and the state, once it grants <span class="highlight">rights</span>, is obliged to use its full power to enforce and protect those <span class="highlight">rights</span> regardless of sex, colour, race or creed, or even financial standing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The law does not regard the foetus as a human being and bestow it with full <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizenship, otherwise the state would not condone the ‘murders’ that pass as abortions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot grant <span class="highlight">rights</span> cheaply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Faced with a similar question of <span class="highlight">rights</span>, including the right to life of the foetus, the United States Supreme Court laid down rules for all abortion laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our Bill is guided by these rules and the common law as they relate to the protection of the life of the woman and to the developing <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the foetus as the gestion progresses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For, once the right to life has been conferred, life should not be taken unless by consent or when it can be proven beyond doubt that the taking of life was essential to protect the equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> of another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It attempts to deal with a question of major social importance - a matter with a wide range of associated questions of medicine, social welfare, the physical and mental health of mothers, basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms of doctors, nurses and hospital staffs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Royal College of Obstetricians, in paragraph 20 of its evidence to the Lane Committee, notes proven cases of duress on doctors, nurses and theatre staff - and Britain’s law is more restricted than that which is proposed here in respect of doctor’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The official South Australian Statutory Committee examining the operation of that State’s Abortion Act note that the law did not provide adequate protection for doctors’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> and convictions but that it was, in practice, coercive of doctors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is, after all, the duty of this national Parliament and its members to determine an issue in which civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the welfare of the mother are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even when she does have an abortion, she automatically involves the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and consciences of a large number of other people - her doctor, the gynaecologist, the nursing staff, the theatre staff, the anaesthetist, and many others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are people who are personally involved and whose <span class="highlight">rights</span> must also be recognised and protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is at stake in this issue is also the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and civil liberties of everyone in this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And because it is the basic right in a democratic society, all other <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the exercise of our civil liberties rest on that fundamental proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What use are our other <span class="highlight">rights</span> and civil liberties if we cannot be assured of the basic right on which they all rest? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet that, I believe, is what we are being asked to do, to shake the whole structure of <span class="highlight">rights</span> and civil liberties by agreeing to the erosion of that basic right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is contrary to the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and humane values which must be the fundamental concerns of a democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the pretence of appealing to indi vidual <span class="highlight">rights</span> it attacks the whole structure of <span class="highlight">rights</span> and civil liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the essential right of the human person, without which obviously no other <span class="highlight">rights</span> will exist for that person, lt is as valid a legal and human right for the life still hidden in the womb of its mother as it is for the life already born and proceeding with an existence independently of the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever reasons there may be for drawing legal distinctions between human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and human responsibilities at different phases of life, abortion used as a deliberate means of destroying a life, and not as a means of saving a life, is a grave attack upon the inviolability of human life, and ought to be an unlawful attack on the inviolability of human life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can see no provision for the father of the unborn child to exercise his responsibilities or his <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if it is accepted, as I accept, that a third person is involved, there must be laws to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of that person - a person incapable of defending his or her own <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that the court had no doubt that this child - although only a matter of a few weeks past conception at the time of the accident - certainly had the legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other members of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in a democratic society the emphasis must be placed on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> - including the right to life and the right to fulfilment - of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in contrast to a totalitarian society in which the right of the individual is subordinated to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that we should not allow ourselves to move, perhaps unwittingly and certainly not consciously, into a kind of society which accepts the subordination of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual, including his most fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to be not an expression of the liberation of a woman but an affront to her womanhood and a denial of her <span class="highlight">rights</span> if it is suggested that all responsibility for avoiding or terminating an unwanted pregnancy should rest with that woman alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that there are ever-changing social attitudes - social values even - questioning constantly in our community such issues as, for example, the age of majority, equality of opportunity - which is an extension of the already achieved right of equality of <span class="highlight">rights</span> - and freedom of individual expression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For if it makes sense to talk about <span class="highlight">rights</span> at all, they can only be attributed to an individual which has certain characteristics, namely, those characteristics which make a person a person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But nothing as superficial as a shape or heart beat can be used in deciding the question of whether or not a foetus is a person who has <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus a person is a moral agent with intelligence, aims and goals; who has the capacity for reasoning, willing, desiring and loving; who has the capacity to relate to and respond to others, lt is the existence of these characteristics which gives rise to <span class="highlight">rights</span>, that is, a person has <span class="highlight">rights</span> just because he has his own personality, because he is a mora) agent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the current debate, the attribution of <span class="highlight">rights</span> to a foetus has been thought to be justifiable on the grounds that a foetus is potentially a person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus unborn children have been recognised as acquiring <span class="highlight">rights</span> or interests by way of inheritance or other devolution of property, but the existence of these <span class="highlight">rights</span> is contingent upon the child being born alive; that is, these <span class="highlight">rights</span> are retrospective <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, if the foetus dies, it can have had no <span class="highlight">rights</span> as a person and thus no right to survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Doctors may differ in degree in interpreting the law, but I submit that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a mother are well protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While thelaw provides for protection of a mother’s life, under these circumstances the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of an unborn child normally would still remain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That an unborn child has <span class="highlight">rights</span> is widely recognised despite comments that have been made in the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even in the Bill the <span class="highlight">rights</span> are preserved when pregnancy has reached a period of 23 weeks, in the second term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some <span class="highlight">rights</span> are given earlier than 23 weeks in the Bill, except where the life of a mother or serious permanent injury to her is threatened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the fundamental question before the House is whether the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of an unborn child should be recognised during the whole or only part of a pregnancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that an unborn child is at an advanced stage at the period suggested in the Bill as the time when the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the unborn child are acknowledged by the honourable members who are proposing the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue is generally described as abortion on demand, or, in other words, where an abortion for any reason is made legal on request without any regard to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the unborn child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Social Security has disregarded statements that have been made all round the world by leaders, both civil and religious, about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the unborn child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the statements that have been  ma:e  about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the unborn child appear in the Declaration of the <span class="highlight">Rights</span> of a Child, United Nations General Assembly, 20th November 1959, which reads: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a tragic day for Australia if we submitted to the hysterical and uninformed pressure of a minority clamouring for abortion on demand as part of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If human <span class="highlight">rights</span> are involved in this, let me invoke the supreme right of all - the right to life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They give valuable <span class="highlight">rights</span> to an insurer or auditor to have a rehearing of decisions taken by the Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the State governments claiming sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> in some of the same areas as the Commonwealth, we find ourselves in the absurd position of having one of the longest coastlines and most extensive continental shelves of ail littoral nations, without a clear decision on this most important matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for us - here in the national Parliament  - to  provide the legislative framework which will enable the national Government to exert its sovereign national <span class="highlight">rights</span> and  to  speak with authority in national terms on these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part II of the Bill, which deals with sovereignty over the territorial sea and sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> in respect of the continental shelf, is based largely on the earlier Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill which has been discussed previously in this House at length. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly clause  11  makes it clear that the sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australia in respect of the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the continental shelf are vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, the Bill contains, in Division  3  of Part II, certain saving provisions to ensure that the assertion of Commonwealth sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the territorial sea will not invalidate existing property <span class="highlight">rights</span> in wharves and other installations or works, nor limit or exclude the operation of any law of the Commonwealth, a Territory or a State in force at the date of commencement of this legislation or coming into force after that date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This exemption will not extend to any State law in so far as it is expressed to vest  any  sovereignty or sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span>, or to make these exercisable otherwise than provided in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other short-term title is the access authority which will authorise a title holder to have limited access to areas outside his title area if the Minister is satisfied that this is necessary or desirable for the more effective exercise and proper performance of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and duties of the title holder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the aim of ensuring continuity of supplies and uniformity of price, the Authority will have trading <span class="highlight">rights</span> to buy and sell hydrocarbons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the whole objective of including a reunuciation is to ensure that when we present - as we must do in cases of dual citizenship - a case on behalf of an Australian citizen, that we are in a position to say that we do not accept dual citizenship in any way as reducing the <span class="highlight">rights</span> pertinent to an Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a White Paper issued by Her Majesty’s Stationery Office in London dealing with this particular problem which we have of acquiring land for social good where there must be some subordination of individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> but not a complete overriding of individual <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so a balance must constantly be struck between the overriding duty of the State to ensure that essential developments are undertaken for the benefit of the whole community and the no less compelling need to protect the interests of those whose personal <span class="highlight">rights</span> or private property may be injured in the process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present intention of the Government is not to protect the interests of those whose personal <span class="highlight">rights</span> or private property may be injured in the process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is merely a not unreasonable method in most ways to amend the Act which was the instrument of attaining the goals of the previous Government but there are the objections to which I have referred and which I think are of great interest to very many Australians who value their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and who do not wish to be overridden by an all-powerful government - people who need the protection of courts and who need to be sure that this new Commission will not be concerned only with cities, important as they are, whether they are old or new, but be concerned also with the regional development which is an integral part of the Bill and of the program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, as regards the last point which the honourable member raised, we have said consistently that pensioners will receive the same standards of treatment and the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges as do other members of the community and, accordingly, they will have a full entitlement to private specialist medical services and those private specialist medical services will be covered by our health insurance proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will work intensively with State and local authorities, but we will not allow State <span class="highlight">rights</span> to work against the overall national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is indicative of the Government’s intentions that its concentration is on those 2 big cities which certainly have <span class="highlight">rights</span> and which certainly need assistance but not at the expense of the rest of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will cut out the ambitions and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of many other regions, including rural areas and the cities and towns in Australia, which rightly are looking for some assistance in regional development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must have a proper federal system of control, that is, a system under which all the States have their <span class="highlight">rights</span> in an authority and the matter is dealt with on a purely federal and national basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I realise that to ratify conventions, the Commonwealth Government must obtain the approval of the State governments because they have sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that many honourable gentlemen opposite who are smiling at this idea of women standing up for their <span class="highlight">rights</span> might find that they will lose either their smile or their seat after the next election if they do not pay proper heed to what women are thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The petition also requested payment of $6 billion to enable Aboriginals to achieve economic parity with other Australian citizens, and associated this claim with a claim for land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has acknowledged Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> to land on reserves in the Northern Territory and has appointed the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission to inquire into means of implementing its policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the guise of nationalism this Bill will restrict the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual investors and restrict the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual landowners, providing undue intrusion into the opportunities of each of the citizens of our towns and cities around Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Parliamentary committees in this area - in the matter of voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> and in the matter of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the people of Yirrkala - have played a constructive role and I am sure that this Committee will play a similarly constructive role in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not intend to interfere with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members having been one for so very long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who likes to study the record of the previous Government over a long period of time will see that members’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> were restricted, that there was no such thing as open government and that there was no chance of private members getting a go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is this because the Premier of Queensland has been a very good Queenslander and has stood up for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of that State against this Government despite the intimidation that has been thrown against him by this Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been surprised and very disappointed that Queensland members in this House have been prepared to take him to task for defending the State <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pay a tribute to Jo Petersen for the way in which he has stood up for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Queensland and for State <span class="highlight">rights</span> generally against a centralist government which is prepared constantly to defer - I use that word because it cannot be said that it will not do anything - work on this important project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this time we recognise that every time somebody enforces his right to drive his car through the city the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all others are diminished a little. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the real issue is one of individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> - whether we will continue to let the demands made on the urban system by the motor car continue to ride rough-shod over the lives of people and the quality of the human settlement of which they are a part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am not suggesting that a husband has paramount <span class="highlight">rights</span>; but I would have thought that in many circumstances equity would have screamed out for consultation with the husband. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is laudable to be concerned for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the consumer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The maintenance of consumer <span class="highlight">rights</span> may be stated as an objective of the Prices Justification Tribunal but only the Bill will show whether it is a reality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate his idealism but I find it hard to accept the notion of a prices justification tribunal as upholding the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the consumer by pillorying the major supermarket when it increases the price of bargain basement items but leaving without scrutiny every shopkeeper whose turnover last year was less than $20m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am fully aware of the need for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the consumer and I am most concerned with the present galloping inflation, as would any Australian be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is, of course, the way in which the States have exercised their <span class="highlight">rights</span> under the existing legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, the Government is following a course which is becoming usual with it, of treating the States and their <span class="highlight">rights</span> with complete disregard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, there is the territorial sea, over which it was assumed until recently the States had jurisdictional <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but which under this Bill is subjected to Commonwealth control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill vests sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> over the continental shelf in the Commonwealth, to the limit which the Geneva Convention permits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the territorial sea is found in law not to be equivalent to maritime territory but somehow just a bundle of <span class="highlight">rights</span> over a sea area, then the section 123 problem might be avoided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally, a decision about ownership of the sovereignty of the territorial sea does not resolve the quite separate problem of ownership of <span class="highlight">rights</span> in and over the continental shelf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that, while Part II relating to sovereignty and sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> has been before us previously, the other Part relating to the mining code and setting out the details and specifications upon which recovery of minerals should be exercised is entirely new. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my colleague, the honourable member for Parramatta  (Mr N. H. Bowen)  has outlined, there have been significant discussions in respect of Part II on the question of sovereignty and sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth is asserting its <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the determinations of the High Court of Australia are made, I would think that the States will realise that, instead of there being an attack on State <span class="highlight">rights</span>, under the developments which then take place this legislation will actually confer a benefit on the States, because it confers a benefit on all the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it does uphold the principle, a government with a majority in either House could bring in any rnining code it liked and then we could discuss the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and wrongs of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there is a fairly clear assertion of what he believes ought to be the Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There had been no determination of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the nation or the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the various States to the areas of our nation beyond the low water mark. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How ridiculous it is to suggest, as some of them have done, that States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the people’s welfare will be threatened if this Bill is passed by this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the engulfing legality which surrounds the point of contention, I believe that the State governments are not at all concerned for the legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> of their States but simply for the revenue that may accrue from the royalties consequent on any discoveries off their coast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am alarmed that some divisions exist among honourable members opposite, particularly with respect to State <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The exercise by any State - that is to say any country - of sovereign legislative authority and propriety <span class="highlight">rights</span> beyond its land territory is part of its international relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should give us some confidence to think that the doubts can be resolved when, as the honourable member for Farrer said, the negotiations resulted in agreement in regard to the off-shore petroleum leases and petroleum <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to support this measure which, as I understand it and as it was presented quite clearly by the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor),  has for its purpose the clarification of the argument about who controls the mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the territorial seas or submerged lands surrounding Australia extending out as far as the continental shelf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Energy is a diminishing asset If the Government of the nation does not act to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all the people of Australia through legislation of this kind it will have betrayed the people it was elected to represent and to serve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill before the House is another one in the long line of Bills which seek to erode further the sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I firmly uphold the view that this legislation is not concerned with accuracy and justice and State <span class="highlight">rights</span> but is a thrust of pragmatic political professionalism in action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the position in the United States of America, a country where there is a truly com-operative system of federalism, a country which retains and respects the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has for a long time been undisputed in international law that, subject only to the right of ‘innocent passage’ for foreign ships, a coastal country has full sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> in respect of the territorial sea and the seabed and subsoil beneath it in the same manner and to the same extent as it has full sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> in respect of its land territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On behalf of the State of Queensland, I make an appeal to honourable members opposite to display the spirit of nationalism about which the honourable member for Macquarie spoke - a spirit of nationalism where the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a State, however small, shall be respected; where the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the person, as the honourable member for Stirling said, are of paramount importance; and where the historical gulfs and bays of the great State of Queensland and other States will be preserved and maintained as the responsibility of the State and will not be handed over to that monstrosity of centralism that is sought to be generated by a government which is intent on destroying private enterprise, a system of living which has stood the test of time in Australia and a  system  of living to which I am devoted to maintaining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am amazed at the attitude of some of the members of this Parliament who try to make this a question only of State <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason and because these are windfalls, I say that all Australians have an equal right and I, as a representative of an electorate in New South Wales want to put forward the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people in my electorate and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stand up for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of my people in New South Wales and my people in the electorate of Mackellar just as, very rightly, the honourable member for Stirling, for example, stands up for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people in his electorate of Stirling and the people of Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was a compromise constitution because State <span class="highlight">rights</span> were just as strongly held then as they are now, perhaps more so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We acknowledge the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of honourable members to debate them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This will be the third ILO human <span class="highlight">rights</span> convention ratified by Australia in the period since the present Government came to office, the others being Convention No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only one ILO human <span class="highlight">rights</span> convention will remain unratified - No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ill has been accepted as a basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> instrument is demonstrated by the fact that 79 countries have ratified it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he will come back the honourable gentleman will find this speech of mine very important because it does deal with human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a human <span class="highlight">rights</span> problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed amendment to section 19a and proposed new section 19b purports to do this and to that extent are clearly unobjectionable from the point of view of State governments since positive initiative is required by State governments before their <span class="highlight">rights</span> can be affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>State <span class="highlight">rights</span> are further protected by provisions inserted by the previous Government in section 19a, which required the consent in writing of the Premier of a State to the establishment and operation of intrastate airline services and also permitted the Premier to revoke this consent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>State <span class="highlight">rights</span> and control of transport had been protected specifically by the previous government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also where powers had been referred by a State, TAA’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> were clearly understood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet once again the Minister’s second reading speech made no mention of this provision or this intended challenge to the States to have any <span class="highlight">rights</span> at all in the transport field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has cunningly contrived to combine that fact with inclusion of the word ‘transport’ so that TAA will get the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to operate bus services and road transport generally in Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes)  said that this Bill is a proposal to give TransAustralia Airlines <span class="highlight">rights</span> to compete in tourism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously he has not read the Bill because the provisions of the Bill go far beyond this and they give specific <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Trans-Australia Airlines that are not being provided for Ansett Transport Industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill seeks to put on some basis of equilibrium the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people’s airline - TAA - which has been such a successful venture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of the Bill are to (a) provide for 2 members of the House of Representatives for the Australian Capital Territory elected on the basis of single member electorates, with effect from the first sitting of the Twenty-ninth Parliament; (b) provide for full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> for both members for the Australian Capital Territory with all the powers, immunities and privileges held by other members of the House of Representatives; (c) divide the Australian Capital Territory into 2 single member electorates, of which one electorate shall embrace part of the Australian Capital Territory proper and the other electorate shall embrace the remaining part of the Australian Capital Territory plus the Jervis Bay territory - to be effective immediately following the expiry or dissolution of the Twenty-eighth Parliament; and, (d) provide  -  (i) for the setting up of a distribution committee, and (ii) for the inviting of suggestions and objections and preparation of a report to Parliament, along similar lines to that provided for the distribution of a State into electoral divisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Capital Territory was given representation in the Australian Parliament in 1948 on the initiative of the then Labor Government, with effect from the 1949 elections, on the basis that the member representing the Australian Capital Territory had the same voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> as the member for the Northern Territory at that time, namely, that the member could vote only on a motion to disallow an ordinance affecting the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of electors enrolled in the Australian Capital Territory increased from 11,841 in 1949, when the Australian Capital Territory was given its first representation, to 48,127 in 1966 when the member for the Australian Capital Territory was given full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The platform of the Australian Labor Party that all parts and all the people tal Territory and the Northern Territory to be represented by senators with full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In so far as superannuation, retirement and employement security benefits are concerned the Bill continues certain provisions in the existing Papua New Guinea law and preserves the continuity of pensions and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of contributors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of present serving members are protected where they are superior to those provided in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By any standards they are now entitled to be regarded as adults and to be given the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges as well as the duties and responsibilities which adulthood entails. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a growing recognition of the need to accord these young adults the <span class="highlight">rights</span> they are entitled to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sending in investigators on suspicion would have had similar effects and, more fundamentally, could in some cases have been a most unreasonable invasion of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The approach in the preparation of the legislation had been throughout to strike a balance between the need to regulate company activities in the public interest and the preservation of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of companies to carry on business in a private enterprise environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have a continuing effort in the government of these parties to balance the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual or private firms with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and claims of the public interest, but we give preference to the private way of doing things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The needs of local government and semi-government authorities have been considered at Loan Council meetings on the basis that the allocation of borrowing <span class="highlight">rights</span> amongst local bodies is again the responsibility of State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill could, if applied harshly, infringe the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities of the State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with the Government’s policies, it provides that the powers of the Council should be used in ways which will ‘respect, uphold and promote the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of artists to untrammelled freedom in the practice of their arts.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have drawn the amendment up and I put it to this House because I regard this matter so seriously and because I want to indicate how strongly I feel about the position of local government authorities which are entitled, I believe, to an obligation to receive specific and well defined funds in exchange for the realisation that the existing States have <span class="highlight">rights</span> which must be preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Curtin  (Mr Garland)  would be a more plausible champion of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of local government if he had shown some regard for those <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the 3 years during which he was a member of this House and his Party was in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The needs of local and semi-government authorities are considered at Australian Loan Council meetings but the allocation of borrowing <span class="highlight">rights</span> among local bodies is a responsibility of the appropriate State government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad to see that the States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> have been maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All through the discussions we have had on this Bill we have endeavoured to give TAA and ATI equal trading <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a case where equal trading <span class="highlight">rights</span> will not apply, because on my information it will cost TAA about an additional $600,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I challenge that part of his statement in which he said that he would see that equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> were given to TransAustralia Airlines and Ansett Transport Industries Ltd in operating on an intrastate basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Am I to take it from that statement that it is the intention of the Commonwealth to override State <span class="highlight">rights</span> on this matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have demonstrated our active concern for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of peoples oppressed in Rhodesia and South Africa by voting in favour of the last 2 United Nations General Assembly resolutions on Rhodesia, which we had not previously supported, terminating all trade to and from Rhodesia, and by seeking the closure of the Rhodesia Information Centre in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, we have signed, as a first step towards ratification, the 1966 International Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural <span class="highlight">Rights</span> and on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has asserted her sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> to explore and exploit the natural resources of its continental shelf out to the outer shelf of the continental margin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However the States considered the Minister’s attitude to evicting people from their homes as against the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must in providing them realise that the people who go into these homes should continue to be independent and to exercise independent <span class="highlight">rights</span> as individuals in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be, and I am sure it is, understood by honourable members that in these circumstances applications will be made, as they have been made on other occasions by servicemen to opt out of an exercise, and these crew members are exercising their normal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition indicated that, whilst not restricting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of honourable members to participate in these debates, we both would look forward to a reasonable measure of co-operation in order to make up for the time lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as the implementation and operation of the new scheme is concerned, however - and for this purpose I am excluding reference to the parts which deal with members who become candidates at parliamentary elections and with the preservation of <span class="highlight">rights</span> of eligible members who transfer to certain other employment - these to a very large extent, will be short-lived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been informed that rather than have an artificial legislative position under which the repealed provisions would be deemed to remain in force, it would be preferable to continue the existing legislation insofar as it relates to pension <span class="highlight">rights</span> and to amend it in such manner as necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It includes protection of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of public servants appointed to the statutory offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all other legislation this Government has brought in in the fields of health, education, new cities, urban development, local government grants, gas and oil distribution, mining exploration and off-shore <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the central control has been vested in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that this is an interference with State <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ours, unlike the Government’s, is not a path up the slippery slope of advancement which takes into account only one side of the problem; ours is a path of equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> for all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people may be unwilling sellers and, as such, their <span class="highlight">rights</span> must be safeguarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an increasing feeling by women that their aspirations and <span class="highlight">rights</span> are being frustrated by the present political, economic and social structures of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is pressed, it can lead one only to suspect that it is part of the plan which can now be seen to be emerging in such Bills as the Grants Commission Bill and the earlier Electoral Bill to take <span class="highlight">rights</span> and powers away from the States, often by indirect means, and to introduce measures designed to alter the electoral system and to secure maintenance of the present Government in office for an indefinite period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight we are talking about representation of a population half as large as that of Tasmania, which has long been carried by one member for the ACT, a member for many years denied full representation <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the opportunity to vote on issues affecting the Commonwealth of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to have a proper recognition of people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this place tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask this individualist laissez-faire Liberal Party which pays such tribute to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of Australian citizens: Where is this great thing tonight? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if we accept the proposition that we should have a fraction of the representation that Tasmania has, the request that 4 people should represent the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people of the ACT is a very mediocre request when we are confronted with 609 representatives for twice the population of the ACT. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During that time there was much argument and play about whether the Northern Territory had full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> had been granted the then Leader of the Opposition, who is now the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  put a Bill like this on the notice paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But T want to give some support to the argument that was put forward here tonight by the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  who very satisfactorily demolished the Senate (Representation of Territories) Bill as the most serious threat yet to State <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have prided ourselves on having a federal system of government, a system that has protected the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So every effort must be made by the Australian people to ensure that we do not allow the central government to whittle away the authority of the States and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States generally, as it appears to be doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, if this were done we would end up with a hotchpotch Senate representation which would take away the power of the Senate to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the former Government over the years extended greater powers to the member for the Northern Territory who today has full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this chamber, as he should. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see it as a very serious threat to the constitutional <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1936 that member was given his first voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and that was in respect of the disallowance of ordinances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1959 he was given wider <span class="highlight">rights</span> of voting on specific matters affecting the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no constitutional bar to the representation with full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Territories in this House but there is a constitutional bar, I would think, to the representation of those Territories in the other House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable gentleman referred to 1968 and the conferring of voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> on the present honourable member for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not easy to vote against the measure and no one voted against it but it was utterly unprincipled that throughout the time when  Mr Jock  Nelson was a member of this House there was a steel determination on the part of the then Government not to confer voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> on him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  should not have had voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> conferred upon him in mid-term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should have remained throughout that term without a vote and then should have gone to election when we would have had a member elected who had voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>, that matter being determined by the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a piece of absolutely unscrupulous practice on the part of the Government which the honourable gentleman supported to confer on a man <span class="highlight">rights</span> to which he had not been elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Jock Nelson bad continued as a member of this Parliament the honourable member for Mackellar knows very well that the democratic sentiments of the Government of 1968 would not have conferred voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> upon him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the extent of representation the honourable member said that the High Court would probably find that that was the degree to which voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> could be conferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if that is the meaning of ‘extent’, if it can give it to any extent or in the terms it thinks fit, then any extent or terms it thinks fit would include full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that the honourable member for Wentworth can give us lectures in democracy when it comes to discussing the conferring of voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> on members of this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister spoke also of my motives in regard to the 1939 conferring of voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> on the member for the Northern Territory and, incidentally, the member for the Australian Capital Territory at the same time - a matter which he most conveniently forgot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is protection of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people and everything that goes with it, yet the member for the Northern Territory today said that those people do not need additional representation when everybody in the House knows that he is a complete failure himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the tragedies in the change of government and change of attitude is that the Northern Territory, which one would hope would continue to advance towards achieving equal represen tative <span class="highlight">rights</span> in every sense with the original States under the Constitution, is now being pulled back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that the administrative direction which emanates from the office of the Minister for the Northern Territory  (Mr Enderby)  in Canberra is far more significant in determing the opportunities and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual citizens in the north than it was formerly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do now believe that it is likely - considering that this is the site of the Federal Parliament - that there will ever be an occasion when the Australian Capital Territory should enjoy the same representative <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the States House as do the States around this continent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his reply to the Question, the Foreign Minister, said: Now that we have the two UN Conventions on Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, which were presented for signature in 1965, it is to be hoped that the time will soon be past when infringements of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> can be regarded as a purely national concern’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whereas it thinks it can get a little sectional advantage it will find that it will get a major disadvantage which will not be sectional because the rest of Australia will not like to see its <span class="highlight">rights</span> taken away and concentrated in these small sectional interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Country Party opposed a similar financial provision in the Australian National Airlines Bill and was assured by the Minister for Civil Aviation  (Mr Charles Jones)  in the Committee stage that it was intended that in practice Trans-Australia Airlines would not be given preferential borrowing <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has not repealed the National Service Act primarily because it wishes to ensure preservation of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those men who were serving at the date the Government assumed office, including those who have elected to continue their service under the provisions of the National Service Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt should be put on record that by asking that the second reading of this Bill be proceeded with today in this House the Labor Party once again has illustrated its disregard for the normal traditions of the House and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of honourable members to have a reasonable time to consider the contents of Bills presented to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present law is that a company can deduct its prior year losses if it satisfies tests: Either a ‘continuing ownership test’ - that is, persons owning 40 per cent of its capital, voting and dividend right throughout the year of loss own similar <span class="highlight">rights</span> throughout the year of deduction; or, alternatively, a ‘same business test’ - that is, it carries on the same business throughout the year of deduction as it carried on immediately before a disqualifying change in its shareholdings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendments in this Bill will, firstly, increase the 40 per cent continuing ownership test to require  a  more than 50 per cent continuity of capital, dividend and voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the loss company; secondly, remedy certain deficiencies in the safeguarding provisions relating to arrangements intended to defeat the purpose of the continuing ownership test; thirdly, remedy deficiencies in the existing tracing provisions to enable continuing interests in the loss company to be traced to natural persons through companies, trustees and partnerships interposed between the loss company and those natural persons; fourthly, enable the loss deduction to be denied in certain circumstances where the benefit of tax loss deduction is to be derived by ‘outsiders’ or where it is clear that the continuing shareholders in the loss company are not intended to receive the full monetary benefits of their apparent continuing interest in the company; and, fifthly, repeal the special provision relating to newlyincorporated companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Factors such as ‘the area of the division’, ‘the density or sparsity of population’ and references to ‘disabilities arising out of remoteness or distance’ inserted by the previous Government in 1965, are contrary to the concept of equality of political <span class="highlight">rights</span> and encourage departure from the quota of electors in a manner which makes the value of a citizen’s vote depend largely upon his geographical location. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are to take what has happened in this field in Western Australia as an indication of What would be acceptable to the Commonwealth, then I believe that this House should not give such a b ank cheque because I believe that what has happened in this field in Western Australia is an infringement on the proper and just <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual Australian citizens and is completely bad in principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The third factor is the provision of extensive quantities of Commonwealth finances annually; the fourth is the provision of an extensive range of Commonwealth and State government blanket incentives to business, industry and people generally to live in these new regional centres; and, fifthly, the provision of adequate safeguards for the property <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those people already living in and having already invested in the specific regional growth centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To conclude differently, and to sanction  minority  control of state legislative bodies, would appear to deny majority <span class="highlight">rights</span> in a way that far surpasses any possible denial of minority <span class="highlight">rights</span> that might otherwise be thought to result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One might have felt that in ‘Defender of the Faith’ there were perhaps the elements of a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in terms of religious freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, instead of promoting the substance of change towards a republic of which even the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to his discredit has spoken, I believe that this Bill will preserve the monarchy and ensure that through the GovernorGeneral there is continued opportunity for us to preserve a system that is written into our Constitution and which so effectively has protected the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of every citizen of this country though the years since Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that one of the important factors in relation to the law of the land is the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the  Deputy  Leader of my party, the honourable member for New England  (Mr Sinclair)  said, our allegiance to the Crown exists not because of our association with the United Kingdom but because of our individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> as Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can he say what Acts have been enacted by (a) each State and (b) the Commonwealth to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the consumer; if so, what are the major provisions of these Acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-73-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>(a) All states have enacted legislation  concerned  with the protection of certain <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the consumer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-73-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has some power to protect certain <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the consumer under legislation such as: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-73-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am referring, of course, to the Senate Select Committee on the Civil <span class="highlight">Rights</span> of Migrant Australians where the excesses of some members of that Committee have been used for political gain so that the purpose of the inquiry and of the establishment of the committee was reversed and, due to disclosures at any time, the fortunes of particular participants varied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that if that method were adopted we could extend the time available for consideration of legislation without in any way restricting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the primary task of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission, appointed by the Government, to recommend on the manner in which this policy is to be implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-47-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The decision to stop action on the granting of all leases on reserves, announced by the Deputy Prime Minister on 7 December 1972, was taken in order to avoid further complicating the land tenure situation on  reserves  pending the outcome of the enquiries of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-47-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>recruited from the United States of America as an adviser on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span>, has criticised the absence of Aborigines from the bodies which determine policies on aboriginal affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-47-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  recommendations include one that there should be full Aboriginal representation and participation in both the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission and the Council for Aboriginal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-47-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No proposals for the appointment of Aborigines to the Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission or to the Council for Aboriginal Affairs are currently under consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-47-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission is at present engaged upon a series of visits to and consultations with Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-47-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is expected that a first report by the Commissioner will make some recommendations on the manner in which the detailed implementation of the Government’s Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> policy should be worked out, taking into account the desirability of full Aboriginal participation in this process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-47-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Possibly the greatest tragedy of Australian politics was the formation of the States with sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these areas did they back the people to the hilt and say that it was wrong that the States should have sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span>, that the people they represented should have the right to have in their own areas a government which would take some responsibility for the area and which would have some regional association with it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Budget is being brought down at a time when the Woodward Committee which is looking into the subject of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> has just presented its interim report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Land <span class="highlight">rights</span> are a matter to which over the months ahead the Parliament will be paying some attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the circumstances, rather than retrace the ground which has been covered already so many times in this debate, I want to address myself to the question of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> within the framework of the appropriation brought down in the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They show why Lake Tyers has become a source of hope not for the Aboriginal people but for racists and critics of the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In choosing to ignore this advice and instead to hand over Lake Tyers to a group of Aborigines described by their own representative in the Victorian Parliament as having ‘at best extremely limited experience in or knowledge of farming operations and probably a complete absence of knowledge of the more vital problems of farm economies’, the Victorian Government showed a cynical disregard for the cause of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to which its spokesmen at the same time were paying lip service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must take into account the effects of mining on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines, on the environment and pollution and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those people who work in and around the mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On this side of the House we are more concerned with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of human beings, their capacity to enjoy life and their ability to take their place in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Far from achieving its stated objectives of stopping tax dodges by the Pitt Street farmers  -  I do not at this stage debate the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or wrongs of this group of producers - the plain fact is that this group will be the main one which will be able to afford to take advantage of the minimal concessions which remain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not stand behind him on every issue, but when it comes to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people I believe that he has a particular gift in recognising what is going on in this country today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am raising a question which is of great interest to you,  Mr Speaker,  and that is the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of honourable members to alter their speeches in Hansard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt you,  Mr Speaker,  as the custodian of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this House, will look into this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Premier of Western Australia,  Mr Tonkin,  has shown some desire to retain control over the constitutional <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States, he has obviously wilted under the pressure of the centralist Government in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are an attack on individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> in a democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This not only attacks the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual but also could stifle the development of land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I see this as a back door way for the Australian Government to take over the constitutional <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the State governments to control the land resources within their States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we must vigorously oppose legislation superimposed upon a State which threatens the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual and establishes the centralist control of land in the hands of Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those who are now speaking about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual should examine what choices are open to the individual or young married couples under the present system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I claim to have been misrepresented and I take the point that it is within my <span class="highlight">rights</span> to state the extent to which I have been misrepresented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a question of members of this House having certain <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges and having an opportunity to say what they want to say in the interests of their electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is better to take a long time than to make the wrong decision and ignore the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual citizens, which is what the proposal to establish an airport at Galston does, because let there be no question that if this proposal is proceeded with, not only will a great area of bushland near Sydney be destroyed, but goodness knows how many hills will have to be bulldozed down and how many valleys filled up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I were asked to illustrate a third factor I would quickly indicate the acceleration towards centralisation in government - the erosion of State <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tied grants, as they have grown in this Parliament over the years and as they are being perpetuated very strongly by this Government, in fact amount to a form of duress on State governments to hand over some of their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In their battle to protect State <span class="highlight">rights</span>, they have entirely forgotten the only <span class="highlight">rights</span> that matter - the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people, a right to expect protection from inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was talking in that debate about <span class="highlight">rights</span> only being as strong as when protected by might - by the State and I said that once a State had conferred that right, it must use its might to protect it from then on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For, once the right to life has been conferred, life should not be taken unless by consent or when it can be proven beyond doubt that the taking of life was essential to protect the equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> of another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The basic rationale of the speciality rule is to safeguard the liberty of the person and protect his human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, especially where a person is only accused of an offence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem has been to achieve a balance between that principle of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> on the one hand and efficient law enforcement on the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The consent modification has been included in recent treaties made between foreign states and in the draft treaties recently negotiated by Australia, lt gives flexibility to and removes the inhibiting effect of the otherwise strict speciality rule and at the same time safeguards the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the accused person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I feel that this is an imposition on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, of course, is a complete fabrication and a denial of traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span> which have been build up in this country for very good reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An even more despicable action by the Minister has been the abolition of the concession on the sale of mining <span class="highlight">rights</span> allowed to those prospectors who, once in a lifetime, discover an economic mining project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This could resolve, for what it is worth, the abstract question of who has sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> off-shore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important Supreme Court case of Pollard’s lessee v. Hagan in 1845 established that States entering the Union subsequent to the original federation were admitted on an equal footing and therefore acquired the same sovereign and proprietary <span class="highlight">rights</span> in tidal lands and submerged lands under internal waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The litigation in the Supreme Court since 1947 has not controverted the fundamental underlying principle, namely, State <span class="highlight">rights</span> to submerged lands under internal waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been frequent United States decisions establishing national property <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the territorial sea, but until the United <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>States v. California case in 1947 it was not clear how these <span class="highlight">rights</span> were divided in the federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In substance the Supreme Court was able to say that property <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the territorial sea had coalesced with political <span class="highlight">rights</span>, that political <span class="highlight">rights</span> must vest in the national Government, and therefore property <span class="highlight">rights</span> must too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It probably sparked the litigation in the Supreme Court to adjudicate between State and Federal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was the first of 3 United States Supreme Court cases - the others were the United States v. Texas and the United States v. Louisiana both in 1950 - involving <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the submerged lands underlying the ocean and outside the internal waters of California, Texas and Louisiana. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The California case, a test case to determine the extent of respective <span class="highlight">rights</span>, was instituted by the United States against the State of California in the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is suggested that our rather legalistic High Court will have to search for an historical vesting of <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the territorial sea in one of our federal polities, rather than hand down a decision overtly motivated by political consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances, Texas quite naturally argued that, as an independent nation, it had acquired paramount <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the territorial sea equivalent to those awarded to the United States by the Supreme Court in the California case by virtue of its national external sovereignty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It invoked the ‘equal footing* clause against Texas by holding that irrespective of its pre-admission status upon admission to the Union its <span class="highlight">rights</span> in adjacent maritime areas were no greater than those of any other coastal State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Supreme Court held in 1947, by a vote of 6 to 2, that the United States and not California had paramount <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the territorial sea and, incident to this, full dominion over the resources of the appurtenant seabed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While this judgment settled the basic division of legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> over submerged lands, it made no precise demarcation of the Federal-State boundary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly, the only necessary parallels for Australia in litigation are the first California case which determined <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the territorial sea and the Special Master’s Report which decided upon the extent of internal waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We now have the 12- mile limit for fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the field of determination of fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span> there are tremendous problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is necessary for the Commonwealth to assume financial responsibilities if there is to be an exercise of its sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> beyond the 3-mile limit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge that the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  asserts the necessity for one government to have sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> over the area between the low water mark and whatever might be the ultimate limit of Australia’s territorial sea, but I do not believe that that is the way in which we will be able to overcome the day to day problems of administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to offshore minerals other than petroleum, the Commonwealth is of the view that it should proceed on the footing that it enjoys total <span class="highlight">rights</span> outside the 3-mile limit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They feel that if they give away any of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> that they have to the Federal Government this would be another step towards centralisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one thing clearly came out of those negotiations it was that the Premier and the Government of Queensland were prepared to defend the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people in those islands to remain a part of my own great State of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to off-shore minerals other than petroleum, the Commonwealth is of the view that it should proceed on the footing that it enjoys total <span class="highlight">rights</span> outside the 3-mile limit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point which I sought to have clarified today was that, in order that I as a member of this Parliament may exercise the <span class="highlight">rights</span> that are conferred upon me as a member of this House by the Standing Orders of this House, it is important that the rulings of the  Speaker  be clearly given on doubts that any honourable member may have with regard to the interpretation of the Standing Orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may have had information which he is concerned that we, the elected members of this House, should not see and which we, the elected members, are to be prevented from observing in exercise of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> that we have under the Standing Orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he did not want to produce the document and if the document was of a special nature there are certain <span class="highlight">rights</span> that he has as a Minister to indicate to the House that the papers are of a character that does not require him to produce them, but he did not exercise that right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You,  Sir, are  the custodian of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the members of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday members of this House exercised their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They exercised their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to peruse those documents, and because of the sleight of hand by the  Deputy  Prime Minister those <span class="highlight">rights</span> have been denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in our view your responsibility to see that those <span class="highlight">rights</span> are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is intended by you that when that occurs that waives the first request you should so indicate to the members of this House so they can press their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to have documents incorporated in Hansard as a whole and not small favourable pieces suiting the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can appreciate his attitude if he believes that he has certain <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He does have those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition closed his eyes to breach after breach and of course this meant that migrants who could not speak English and did not understand their <span class="highlight">rights</span> were being exploited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not stumbled on our way from Magna Carta, through the Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, the Act of Settlement, through 2 great wars to have the onus of proof taken away, reversed by capricious government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, if we look at a number of awards and agreements we find that there is a great area where nothing is said, where the intent is left in some doubt, where there is no clear definition of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or responsibilities of either party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is another area where the Minister is, we believe, quite wrongly reducing <span class="highlight">rights</span> and opportunities of unionists, employers and of affected third parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other alterations to rules which can significantly affect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual unionists and the section ought not to be limited as the Minister would want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Doubtless the Minister would argue that this is an extension of the democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the ordinary unionist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labour relations code that I referred to should be regarded as a charter of employees’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> in 2 respects - the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of unionists vis-a-vis their own unions and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of employees vis-a-vis their employers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We often heard the Prime Minister, when he was Leader of the Opposition, championing the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this Parliament and saying that it should be supreme in any major policy announcements that are made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I doubt whether this House has ever heard a more brutal rejection of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> not just of members of the Liberal Party of Australia and members of the Australian Country Part but the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all members than the one we have just heard from the leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  who has not only rejected our <span class="highlight">rights</span> but has announced that he will later on move to use his numbers to prevent the exercise of all our <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One hears a good deal about human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the House that one of the most fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span>, of which we hear little, is the right to be different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the welfare of the people themselves will be mv first concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no quarrel with the provisions contained in this Bill, which is to facilitate the transfer of State officers to the Australian Public Service, because I believe that an officer is entitled in all fairness and justice to have his <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I have said that this is a mechanical Bill, which deals with a Public Service officer’s entitlement to have his <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges protected, I think I have pointed out that there are a few cloudy issues associated with its introduction, which concern every Australian, but more particularly the Aboriginal and Island people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the Opposition will not oppose the passage of this legislation because it serves to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike the governments of Canada, New Zealand and the United States of America, the Australian Government, and the British colonial administration before it have never recognised the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the indigenous people to the land they occupied at the time of European settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy of assimilation seeks that all persons of Aboriginal descent will choose to attain a similar manner and standard of living to that of other Australians, and live as members of a single Australian community, enjoying the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges, accepting the same responsibilities and influenced by the same hopes and loyalties of other Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further in this long history I wish to draw the attention of the House to the words of an Aboriginal civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> leader,  Mr Archie  Smallwood, who summed up in a nutshell the feelings of the people of the multi-racial suburb of Hill End in Brisbane, a suburb where people have learned to live with people who are different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well to give Aborigines the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> as other people to obtain drink, but, in view of the way in which the drink problem is destroying them, the price of being popular in the general community is a very dear one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well for the Government to say that it will buy popularity by giving Aborigines land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, if it is done, as it appears to be done in many cases, “without any wise guidance as to how the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> should be used, it is done at the expense of the well being of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation is creating the opportunity for those persons to enter the Australian Public Service with all their <span class="highlight">rights</span> preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Organisations have indicated voluntarily - because the Government has not reserved any <span class="highlight">rights</span> to demand this co-operation - that they will offer this information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A committee system of this nature would not restrict the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members to debate legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am pleased about this because it recognises the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members to speak in these debates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is almost impossible to believe that the congenial and lovable Fred Daly quite suddenly becomes a diabolical character who will gag a debate in a split second and deprive honourable members of the normal democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> they have to express their points of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So when they talk about wanting <span class="highlight">rights</span> for private members they should remember this: A few days ago on Grievance Day when private members have their only chance once a month to put their views, the Opposition put up frivolous motions and took that time away from the private members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>It has gone on with all this rubbish about State’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> and put impediments in the path of sound proposals and the offers of money to improve the lot of the people in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been said the people of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory should have the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> as the people of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is dishonest - and rank dishonesty - to start talking about this nonsense of the States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> and of the Senate being the States House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the legal terms used by the honourable member for Stirling, Territory senators, when elected, will have equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> with other senators in voting and in respect of everything else associated with Senate membership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, if their votes are bad in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, they should be because members opposite are denying to the people of these Territories the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> as apply to every Australian in every part of Australia outside of the 2 Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We need, above all, a sense of passionate outrage if we are to end this shocking deprivation of migrant children’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee, while conscious of States <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this matter, feels it should register its belief that the interests of handicapped children would be best served if responsibility for their education were placed in the hands of State Education Departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Wannon wandered into the chamber at 10 minutes to 10 this evening and, in a dramatic gesture, he - this wealthy exponent of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual, caring not a hang for the children in sheltered workshops and other institutions - wanted to table a particular document forthwith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor do we want to see a situation in which welfare agencies proliferate and are nationally organised in such a way that there are too many incentives for empire building, demarcation and territorial disputes, and, amongst the personnel, for self-maintenance and career improvement at the possible expense of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people the system is supposed to be helping. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the Liberal Party speakers at the Constitutional Convention did not seem interested in the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were more concerned with what they called the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Treasurer was able to state to the Committee of Twenty at the International Monetary Fund in Washington that Australia was not in favour of allocating special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> to underdeveloped countries, nor of an automatic adjustment process based on objective indications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition recognises the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual Aborigines to effective choice about the degree to which, and the pace at which, they come to identify themselves with our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What we want is equality of <span class="highlight">rights</span> for these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We respect them and they should have equality of <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I knew that we would clash in some areas of deep social policy such as land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and so on, but, generally speaking, when it comes to treating people the way people ought to be treated, there is not a great deal of difference in the Australian community between left, right and centre about the immediate needs of the person on the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply point out that there is a question on the notice paper which I put down on 8 March last dealing with the announced intention of the Attorney to engage foreign lawyers to advise him on the drafting of certain legislation dealing with Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and restrictive trade practices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the legal profession and governments are really concerned with the legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the weaker, or indeed all, members of Australian society then the limitations of Australian legal aid schemes will have to be recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish also to refer to the telex system which is connected from the committee room of the Senate Select Committee on Civil <span class="highlight">Rights</span> of Migrant Australians direct to the AttorneyGeneral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A recent example of this is the grant of $2m to the States to operate their legal aid systems and to allow people to exercise their legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> whether those <span class="highlight">rights</span> come from this Parliament or the State Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The creation of the Legal Aid Office which will depend upon the services of salaried legal officers will also allow people to take full advantage of their legal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer also to the fiat that was given to enable citizens of Canberra to use legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> that they might not otherwise have been able to use in the legal challenge in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory concerning the tower on Black Mountain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This case is another typical example of the attitude of the Government to the people being given legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> and being allowed to exercise them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the field of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, or civil liberties if honourable members wish to call it that, the International Labour Organisation conventions on human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, race and discrimination have been ratified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think one of the saddest things about the campaign for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> has been the emphasis which so many professional Aborigines have put on drinking <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was in the Northern Territory when various people, who were members of the Committee for the <span class="highlight">Rights</span> of Aborigines and Torres Strait islanders - the former Minister was one - and various other interested bodies were ramming very hard for Aborigines to have equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> with Europeans to drink alcohol, to go into bars and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Land acquisition and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of and responsibilities of the Legislative Council are two of the most important and most urgent matters which should be discussed by the Government and considered by the Minister for the Northern Territory, whether he is the Minister now sitting at the table, the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory, or the Minister for Northern Development  (Dr Patterson)  who is in Japan or on his way home from there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a long time since members have spoken on 2 occasions in a debate, and the honourable member for Lilley was quite within his <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past 9 months country people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> have been quickly cut away and many are saying that this is just another step in the campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest that some honourable members opposite, who are running away from their responsibilities as members of the House of Representatives, should consider that aspect, especially members opposite who are publicly stating that they will in no way interfere with the profit-taking <span class="highlight">rights</span> of multi-national corporations even where Australia’s interests are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Further, the Commission shall have regard to Article 26 of the United Nations charter on human <span class="highlight">rights</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and fundamental freedoms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say at once that the Government gladly accepts the inclusion in this Bill of the extract from the Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> from which the former Minister for Education and Science, the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has quoted, embodying, as it does very thoroughly, the philosophy and statements of faith on which the legislation before the House rests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This factionalism, this whole sense of trying to get different groups fighting for their <span class="highlight">rights</span>, fighting to see whether they can get a bigger slice of the cake than another particular group, is implicit in the matters raised by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have already said I believe that we should do what we can to maintain an independent school system so that this very necessary aspect of the individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people in Australia - that is freedom of choice in the education of their children - should be preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the functions of the Schools Commission we have mentioned specifically in our amendment Article  26  of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> which states very specifically that parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By involving ourselves in the school and by speaking to the teachers, to those in areas of responsibility in school councils and to the principals we can have not only a greater understanding and involvement but also have a greater say in what our children should be taught and how they should be taught without interfering with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the benefits that come from having fully trained teachers coming from the expanded now governmentfinanced tertiary institute of teaching colleges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further the Commission shall have regard to Article 26 of the United Nations Charter on Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> a copy of which is set out hereunder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All we are doing here is asking the Schools Commission to take into account the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has suggested that if we do not think that Article 26 of the United Nations Charter on Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> should be in the Bill we are against the United Nations Charter and Article 26 of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The emphasis that originally pointed to the importance of examining the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and interests of students and children of our country has been translated into a concern for schools rather than for children themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment that we seek to include in the legislation is to require the Commission to have regard to the principles as set out in article 26 of the United Nations Charter on Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is another section of the Charter which speaks of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the unborn, and that is an extremely mandatory section of the Charter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a shame that the Opposition cannot work up the same fervour in defence of people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> where private funds are concerned, where there is much more opportunity for abuse and prying and meddling in the medical records of private people than there will ever be under the program which we are introducing and which will have iron-clad guarantees to preserve the individual privacy of members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What the people are saying is that the arbitrary, high-handed intervention in the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual is something which is anathema to Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is pursuing a course of action which denies the <span class="highlight">rights</span> not only of those the Government likes to call the big men but of thousands of Australians - the Australian who owns his own home, the Australian who is paying a bank, a hire purchase company or a land development company for his land or his home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government acknowledges that the common law which was planted from England into the Australian colonies did not give proper <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the Aboriginal inhabitants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But,  Mr Speaker,  it needs to be pointed out that to defend the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of homosexuals is not to endorse or advocate homosexuality; it is simply to recognise that, as long as homosexuals abide by laws to which all citizens are subject, they ought equally to be free to express their sexual preferences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That has been done but of course any publicity of this fact has been suppressed in the countryside because it is not in the interests of sectional groups to have the people they are supposed to represent know what has been done and know what their <span class="highlight">rights</span> are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In paragraph (a) (iii) - I suppose the use of Roman numerals there is somewhat archaic as well - there is reference to the term ‘services’ including a contract for the conferring of <span class="highlight">rights</span> or privileges for which remuneration is payable - wait for it - in the form of a tribute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United States, which is often said to be the home of capitalist society, has had strong protective legislation for many years - legislation which guarantees the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of consumers and which outlaws many of the insidious practices which have been allowed to go on in this country virtually unchecked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 45 provides that a contract in restraint of trade or commerce is unlawful insofar as it confers <span class="highlight">rights</span> or benefits or imposes duties or obligations upon a corporation and that a corporation shall not make a contract or engage in or be a party to a combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only that, but also when they get down to basic electoral matters they want to abuse the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the electors of Murray by offering a $1,000 bribe to the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As recently as 1 1 October this year the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory passed a resolution seeking voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> in referendums on the same conditions as those enjoyed by citizens in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have been denied their <span class="highlight">rights</span> for too long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Electoral boundaries should be drawn to suit the convenience and to guarantee the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens, not to allow the manipulation of political power that we have seen in this country in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This certainly accords with his well-known views on the powers and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Commonwealth, and on the role of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But before that happens this Parliament is being asked to decide its attitude, and in my opinion this Parliament should reject outright the over-riding of States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> which the Prime Minister’s proposal represents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the words subject to this Constitution’ in section 106 mean the Constitution as passed into law in 1900, then the Prime Minister cannot use the amending power of section 128 to cut down the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the states under section 106 simply by the device of inserting a new section called 106a. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Supreme Court of the United States, however, ruled in a historic judgment that such practices were prohibited by the Federal Constitution - in particular, by the equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is abusing its <span class="highlight">rights</span> as a government by trying to stifle the Opposition and by trying to get this matter before the Australian people by stealth, hoping that in their ignorance they might cast a yes vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not unfair to say that in the past State Premiers have regarded any proposals for the direct financing of local government by the Federal Government as an intrusion into State <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities, and have been loath to let their power go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have said before, a matter of privilege in this House is not an issue of personal <span class="highlight">rights</span> or privileges as that word is normally used in relation to members of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What must be remembered is that privileges are not the prerogative of members in their personal capacities: Insofar as the House claims and members enjoy those <span class="highlight">rights</span> and immunities which are grouped under the general description of ‘privileges’, they are claimed and enjoyed by the House in its corporate capacity and by its members on behalf of the citizens whom they represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1701 the House of Commons resolved that ‘to print or publish any books or libels, reflecting upon the proceedings of the House of Commons, or any member thereof, for, or in relation to, his service therein, is a high violation of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of the House of Commons’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is clear is that our society today has a much more sensitive regard for personal <span class="highlight">rights</span> with respect of privacy and confidentiality of personal information provided on trust and in confidence to official bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This contempt of the political <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the citizens of the Territories was seen again recently in the opposition to our attempts to obtain Senate representation for the people of these areas - the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The political <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all Australians are diminished while some of our citizens are denied the right of fully participating in the governing of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely issues such as the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals, or the nature of parliamentary government, are of vital concern to all Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their claims were strongly put at the time of the last referendum in 1967 when clearly they felt very deeply, as did all Australians, about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The citizens of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory merely seek the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> as other Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The States have long considered that the Palladium of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties as States is to be found in section 128 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>State <span class="highlight">rights</span> is the battle cry which I know we find on occasions irritating and a little difficult to understand, but the attitude of mind is there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the Executive Committee of the Australian Constitutional Convention be requested to give priority consideration to a means of providing citizens in Australian Territories with voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> in referenda equal to those of their compatriots in the Australian States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe we should and maybe we should not, but before we limit the discussion of constitutional reform to what the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States ought to be, surely we should debate whether we want to preserve the federal system at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that we must take a fresh look at those sorts of things which safeguard individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> and which safeguard a system which provides checks and balances aimed at safeguarding individual <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, in the implementation of the socialist platform of the Labor Government, the powers and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individuals of this country will be eroded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members opposite cannot make any case for preserving States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> or anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that when we are drafting an amendment to the Constitution, we should endeavour to preserve the proper functions and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the Government that the electors in the Territories should have that right, but I do not think that since the Constitution is a federal compact we should, in any way, impair the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the electors in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the Prime Minister that in this matter of drafting, he should swallow not his pride but the pride of his Party, and accept my amendment, which is reasonable and one that improves the drafting and makes clear the residual <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States in the federal compact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, it would preserve, as it should preserve, the position of the States explicitly in this section of the Commonwealth Constitution which is part of the federal compact and is drafted around the residual <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States in that compact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I pointed out, the Church of England has been significantly to the fore in this broad area of concern for people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the community and it has been noticeably active, for instance, in expressing its concern about the need for an effective campaign against poverty in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All of us know that there have been significant changes in the area of Commonwealth responsibility but by the arbitrary exclusion of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States to operate in a field such as this there is not only a denial of equity but there is also a denial of a pattern of tradition and of effective administrative operation which is not justified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that clause is a declara tion that the sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australia as a coastal State in respect of the continental shelf for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources are vested in and exercisable by the crown in the right of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be no courtesy in the future activities of the Government in relation to asserting the sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The structure of the proposed development corporation ensured that the States of New South Wales and Victoria would have <span class="highlight">rights</span> equal to those of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also emphasise that this legislation and the future activities of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation must place emphasis on people and their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very important that these people have their <span class="highlight">rights</span> protected by both Federal and State legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to note that the Commission’s report recommends that future development <span class="highlight">rights</span> should from a base date be reserved to the Crown; that is, to the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Australian Government accepts the recommendation of the Commission that future development <span class="highlight">rights</span> be reserved to the public, I propose to recommend to Cabinet that the base date be the date of presentation of this report to the Parliament, that is, 4 December 1973, or at the very least that the relevant legislation provide for transactions to be investigated back to that date to prevent any artificial inflation of prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommendation of most significance is that for the future what are called land development <span class="highlight">rights</span> should not rest as they have done in the past, as it were, in the possession of the owner of the land but should be regarded as property of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister, having had time to read the report, makes a recommendation and so on the proposition will be that from that time on, as from today, all land development <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be the property of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am also not clear on how the value of land development <span class="highlight">rights</span> is to be determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be a dispute about how valuable land development <span class="highlight">rights</span> are in a particular area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this takes place and a cash payment is made to somebody on behalf of these land development <span class="highlight">rights</span>, who is to make that cash payment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or will it, as it seems to be envisaged in the report, be a cash payment made by a private developer who, acquiring the land, as he does, somehow or other arrives at a decision as to what the land development <span class="highlight">rights</span> are worth and makes that payment to the public body concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that happens, and it appears that it would, it will require much more detailed examination than we can give it at the moment to see how this will help very much the ultimate consumer of the block of land in that development and the house that is built upon it, because if the full value of land development <span class="highlight">rights</span> is paid by the developer clearly he will get back that full value when he sells the blocks of land and subdivides them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some cases I think it has been, and I am agreeing that it is a bad thing for it to be held to ransom; but I also say that just as the community has <span class="highlight">rights</span> and a right not to be held to ransom so the individual has <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has just <span class="highlight">rights</span> and proper <span class="highlight">rights</span> which should not be overridden by making him by force subsidise the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both these <span class="highlight">rights</span> need to be protected as is clearly noted in the English legislation and in the English approach, as the Minister will agree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These recommendations would allow residential land to be held on freehold basis, except that the Government would retain the development <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, this must not impinge on the original discovery <span class="highlight">rights</span> of researchers and must respect their desire, if expressed, for confidentiality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In turn, as against the $384m paid for imported technology to which I have just referred, Japan received only $50m by selling to other countries the <span class="highlight">rights</span> for its own ideas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a lot of money to be made by countries which are able to patent inventions and then sell the patent <span class="highlight">rights</span>, perhaps to other countries, apart from selling goods that they might produce as a result of that research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This again, has brought in quite a few hundreds of thousands of dollars by way of patent <span class="highlight">rights</span> or royalties, as they might be termed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Personally, I hope that Australia produces the engine invented by  Mr Sarich  and will be able to reap much greater rewards than would be received by merely selling the patent <span class="highlight">rights</span> to other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1972-73, Australia paid out $75m in royalties, copyrights patents and technical service charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy underpinning the legislation is a firm recognition that Australia has vital interests at stake in foreign takeovers and the ownership and control of Australian industry and that those <span class="highlight">rights</span> should be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the legislation itself was a consequence of a Treasury White Paper, it was interesting to note that that White Paper showed that, in terms of foreign ownership in the oil and extractive industries, the proprietary <span class="highlight">rights</span> which are owned by overseas interests amounted to 62 per cent, and yet the control exercised by those <span class="highlight">rights</span> was 83 per cent - a disparity of 21 per cent on the basis of control over proprietary ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this is not an objective to be achieved by usurping the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those overseas organisations which have a majority control today of our resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without debating the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or wrongs of a statutory marketing authority of this type, the point is that the Government has not done what it said it would do and primary producers are getting sick and tired of this Government saying one thing and doing another or, even worse, saying something and then refusing to do anything at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Adrian Parmeter, a United States authority on land <span class="highlight">rights</span> matters, has given advice to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and to my Department on aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To do less is to cheat and distort that expression and to deny the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of present and future Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the major areas lacking in detail are, firstly, the lack of definite guidelines for negotiation of agreements with the State governments in relation to accommodation and finance; secondly, the lack of precise definition of the functions of the Health Insurance Commission; and, thirdly, the lack of definition of doctors’ and patients’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> and entitlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In money terms this would mean that a single pensioner would receive all the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of public hospital treatment and specialist treatment for nothing and he would receive all the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private treatment in hospital and outside for an insurance contribution of about 65c a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My experience is the reverse - that the man who is cynical and mercenary is the man who is crying the loudest - in the Society of General Practitioners in particular - about his civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> to charge what he likes and saying that medical care is not a right, it is a luxury, and that those who want it must pay for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In their attempts to conceal the social inequity of their outmoded and so-called voluntary system of health insurance, the Opposition spokesmen have claimed that improvements in the provision of subsidised health benefits and the inclusion of pensioners within the insurance system will put everything to <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The falsity of most of the criticisms of it and the ferocity with which they have been pursued reveal the self-interest of those behind them and their determination that the privileges of the few should be maintained at the expense of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There inevitably will be a shortage of standard ward beds for many years, and poorer people, who in some States - for example, Victoria - have had special <span class="highlight">rights</span> to beds in public hospitals, will now have to compete for these beds with richer elements in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not want to argue the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and wrongs of this case or what the Minister could do about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder if this particular advertisement has any connection with another advertisement which appeared in the same newspaper on the same day and which was inserted by a bogus organisation calling itself SOS’, which I believe is an organisation based in the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> which is spreading throughout Queensland and about which I will say something in a moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those of us who live there - surely the honourable member for Lilley should be one of them and the honourable member for Bowman  (Mr Keogh),  whom I heard attempting to make some interjection, should be another - ought to realise the need to preserve State <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable members  I  present a statement on the Government’s actions and attitudes on human <span class="highlight">rights</span> which  I  made yesterday on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Clause 7 requires the Commission to pay particular regard to the need for preservation of individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties as far as practicable when proposals for reform are being developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is going to override all the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This limitation of time, we were told, was a denial not only of justice, decency, democracy and free speech, but also of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of generations dead and not yet born. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we speak about freedom of choice and people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>, we must look at what the vast majority of Australians want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In considering the legislation it also needs to be borne in mind that most non-bank financial institutions are already subject to supervision under State or territory laws which deal primarily with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of borrowers and lenders and the financial stability of companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Health Services Commission although, as the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp)  has pointed out, we wish to see that its method of operation takes full account of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities of State governments and of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have reservations about whether it will adequately protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities of the States and, even more importantly, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, when people talk about consulting the States and protecting State <span class="highlight">rights</span>, I would have thought that the pre-school education and child minding area was very specifically one for the States; but in cases in which it suited the former government it had no compunction at all in excluding the States from its legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The company says that in relation to present State leasing <span class="highlight">rights</span> generally it agrees to the Authority providing that the Authority allows for the continued existence of individual explorers and developers in co-operation and competition on equal terms with the Authority, and that the Authority confines its activities to the Territories and off-shore areas or leases from the States and undertakes work commitments similar to the rest of the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The advertisement was published, no doubt, because of the anniversary of the Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> and because this weekend we are to be visited by the  President  of the Ukrainian National Republic in Exile,  Mr Livytskyj  who will be holding a public meeting in Canberra on Sunday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So far as the damage alleged to be caused by workmen on the Tuggeranong project is concerned, the Minister for Services and Property advises that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of rural landholders are respected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I inform honourable senators and members that I have decided not to refer to the Privy Council petitions addressed to me by the State of Queensland and the State of Tasmania concerning <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the seabed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740228_reps_28_hor88/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government proposes the permanent protection of these <span class="highlight">rights</span> by an amendment of the Constitution so that they may never foe taken away by the enemies of democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is in this document that we must provide permanent guarantees of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fundamental electoral law hitherto has been that the electors of Australia are the people to worry about - that the people we are concerned with are the people who are citizens of Australia and who have <span class="highlight">rights</span> as electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final paragraph I am referring to here now, because of time, is in section 128 -  in view of the language of the early part of the section it can hardly be questioned that that paragraph may itself be altered or eliminated so that what would be necessary to deprive a State of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> there mentioned, would be to hold one referendum in order to alter the paragraph, and after a proper interval, a second referendum in order to alter the relevant section of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian Embassy has given all the assurances in the world that we do not wish to interrupt the course of justice and the hearings in Austria, but we have certainly said, through all the means that are available to us, that the mother and the child should be able to get together and I would hope that the representations that are being made in a continuing way to the Austrian authorities will persuade the Austrian authorities to recognise the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this Australian mother in this situation and also to act in the best interests of the child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly in Australia the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the mother are sacrosanct, and we would hope that this would also apply generally to Australian citizens around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has happened lends impetus to the efforts that are being made by the Government to achieve some agreement with overseas countries that court orders made in Australia should be recognised in other countries and that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australian citizens in relation to children of dual nationality should be properly appreciated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that the best traditions of Austrian administration would recognise the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of an Australian mother in relation to her Australian child so that the mother and child can be reunited quickly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consistent with this Government’s great interest in human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, including the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual in time of armed conflict——- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the River Murray Waters Act preceded the Officers’ <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Declaration Act and the Superannuation Act, there have been problems in the application of those Acts to staff of the River Murray Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislative program, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members, committee and party meetings and the electoral commitments of the various members in their constituencies all have to be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislative program was carried through with honourable members opposite exercising their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to put their points of view on certain issues, sometimes with grim results, but that is part and parcel of the game. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fifth is the protection of members’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> by non-interference with grievance debates, general business and adjournment debates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members may be assured that we will preserve to the full their <span class="highlight">rights</span> as private members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have disguised thinly but surely another attack on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have once again the whittling away of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is another erosion of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the private member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I am concerned, the people of Australia do not elect Ministers, they elect representatives and that was an incursion into the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Private members received no <span class="highlight">rights</span> or consideration under the former Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members are not the first objective of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I suggest that gradually, as time has gone by and as honourable members have seen what has flowed from this decision to close the Parliament down at 11 o’clock at night, an increasing number of people have been prepared to return to the old system under which we sat later if the Government’s legislative program or the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members demanded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why are we talking about taking away the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the parties to consider legislation properly? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, so that the Minister can maintain his reputation, the hours of this Parliament are being distorted and private members’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> are being taken away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, what is hap pening in this Parliament and throughout the country is that our <span class="highlight">rights</span> are being what I would call ‘Whitlamised’ away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Development of the concept that people have <span class="highlight">rights</span> which deserve no less protection than property has also been a radical approach brought by this Government, radical only in that it conflicts hard with the conservative line of the previous Government The promises which have been made have been either carried out or will be carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Electoral reform has been promised on 2 broad grounds - equality of voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> for all our citizens and the need to disclose funds and to say from where the money is coming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, such action could well be a safety valve in our democratic system providing it is kept within certain limits and does not infringe the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and safety of other citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am going to check to see whether I will be inside my <span class="highlight">rights</span> under the relevant ordinance to have an amnesty on those people who have received parking tickets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In your own right - without attention being drawn to a matter without complaint - you have an obligation to protect the interests, the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the good name and the characters of private members of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This House will be destroyed if you as  Speaker  are not prepared to exercise the sort of authority that you are given under that standing order to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members, and it will not be long before every member of this House, is cowed into a state of silence and submissiveness by these bullying tactics, used in an attempt to silence and prevent them from doing their duty by seeking to impugn their characters in the way in which the Prime Minister has been doing constantly since he occupied that office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That did not stop this great defender of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members of this Parliament - the man who objects now to these words - from attacking a man whose reputation in this country is unequalled probably by any member of the Public Service anywhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a massive trade off of the public’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> and entitlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation which says that everybody must by free to do what they want, and if they are not free to do what they want the Government will go to court and ask the court to decide whether they ought to be free to do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder what would have been the consequences for  Senator Murphy  if we had had the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation on the statute books before he invaded ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He could not resist the opportunity to attack the Queensland Government and its very fine Premier who so often, to the Prime Minister’s acute embarrassment, has exposed the motives of this Federal Government to destroy State governments, to usurp their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and to centralise all control in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to talk on many other matters, but I do want to say that the people of Queensland are sick and tired of a government which is trying to take away their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and which loses no opportunity to denigrate their Premier and their Government and to impose a system that is not democratic but is the very antithesis of democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again it intends to ask the .people whether they want their local government - the level of government to which it is claimed they are closest- to have access to the Loan Council so that it may enjoy the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> as the States and not be just a Cinderella and a creature of the States to be brought forward and disbanded at will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking about States <span class="highlight">rights</span>, sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span>, national governments, national parliaments and asking people questions, it is my firm belief that under the rather loose system that operates in Australia so far as the States are concerned, it must be understood and it is understood that the Australian Government works in a rather tight straight jacket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>International Monetary Fund of special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> which are being created as a special reserve asset has become a contentious issue in world politics as less developed countries contend that the developed countries are keeping the special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> for their own benefit and not using them to help development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances there is surely at least a firm obligation on the governments of developed countries which are benefiting from the allocation of special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> at least to keep up with their obligations to the World Bank which are related to their IMF quotas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Never before has there been such cooperation between State and Federal authorities, with the State Government standing up for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of its Western Australian citizens in no uncertain manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is, of course, doing what he is paid for and one would be disappointed if he failed to earn the money he is so paid - paid in many cases to hide the facts of the previous Government’s policies, to hide the fact that the last Liberal Government sadly neglected the State’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Western Australian citizens and that past Western Australian Liberal Governments failed to stand up to their Federal counterparts to gain just recognition of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Western Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The State’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> groups which have been formed in Western Australia have produced, and continue to produce, masses of statistics which prove this neglect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No wonder they talk secession, in view of the lack of recognition by succeeding Liberal governments, both State and Federal, of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Western Australians to a fair and equitable treatment in the distribution of national revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The centralism bogy with its anachronistic calls to the worst and most divisive features of the old States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> argument is something which we can well do without. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The States consider - and I believe that this is the case - that they now have fewer <span class="highlight">rights</span>, less power and less room to manoeuvre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I find it more than a little curious that a party which aspires to the great traditions of small ‘1’ liberalism by putting a capital ‘L’ on its political designation should prove itself so reactionary, so repressive and so depriving in the way in which it approaches issues that affect fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure honourable members that the evidence there shows that these sorts of assertions are grossly over-blown and I do not believe that the Liberal Party does itself any credit, if it claims to be a liberal party, by jumping on the bandwaggon of reaction where social welfare benefits and services are concerned and where peoples’ fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> to self respect and dignity are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But on behalf of the Government I must say that we have abolished discriminations, but above all we have set out to preserve the aspirations as well as the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will go down in the history of our country as one of the great declarations on human <span class="highlight">rights</span> insofar as it relates to migrant tradesmen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The unions, far from being racist, are determined to see that the skilled tradesmen who have not had the advantage of being born in this country and therefore who are not in a position to understand what their <span class="highlight">rights</span> are under the law, are not exploited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason they have insisted on the provisions of the Tradesmen’s <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Regulation Act, an Act which was passed by this Parliament in 1947, being carried out and solemnly observed by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficulty about the clause of the Bill that I put last season was that once we include a provision in the Act that decrees that an agreement automatically expires at its termination date, we immediately create at that moment a hiatus which cannot be filled until the agreement is renewed or replaced and during that period of hiatus there is a situation in which at law employees would not be entitled to claim any of their accrued annual leave or sick leave <span class="highlight">rights</span> or long service leave <span class="highlight">rights</span>, if long service leave happened to be a feature of the agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I personally favour the Else-Mitchell report which recommends that residential land should be freehold with the development <span class="highlight">rights</span> maintained by the development authority or the State, but in the case of commercial or industrial land it should be leasehold as it is here in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the introduction of special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span>, this method continued to prevail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same way we would not favour a mandatory requirement for conversion to special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> without some degree of flexibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general, we favour the move to reduce the role of reserve currencies to enable special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> to become the primary reserve asset of the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A declaration of what sort of international value should be fixed for drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span>, or SDRs, will not cure the international problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When referring to special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> the Treasurer mentioned that he sees in them the main reserve asset of the reformed monetary system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe that special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> can and should have a role far more extensive than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that statutory drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> are one such vehicle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I do see and accept much of the merits in the concern which is expressed about the difficulty of establishing the value of statutory drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> in terms of a basket of currencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet 1 believe that concept of statutory drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> is imperative of resolution both in terms of statutory drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> becoming a main reserve asset of a reformed monetary system and also a possible alternative currency of international exchange. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Committee of Twenty is very important to Australia and that the action that has been taken in establishing statutory drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> to be worth while. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that an extension of the role of statutory drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> might permit them to be not only the means by which there can be a restoration of international balance of payments equilibrium, nor only that there might be a new worth while reserve asset of a reformed monetary system, but that also there might be a new valid, available and stable international unit of currency which can be used in international trade arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the course of my remarks I shall give honourable members some details justifying this statement and explaining how a decision was made as to what was the status of freedom and what the political and civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> were like in a particular country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One is a perfect score and seven represents a complete absence of civil and political <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A democracy requires civil and political <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> are the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual against the state, <span class="highlight">rights</span> to free expression, to a fair trial; they are what most of us mean by freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Political <span class="highlight">rights</span> are legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> to play a part in determining who governs or what the laws of the community are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, to a degree the two kinds of <span class="highlight">rights</span> are interdependent: civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> without political <span class="highlight">rights</span> are apt to be lost and political <span class="highlight">rights</span> without civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> are meaningless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When a country’s standing in political <span class="highlight">rights</span> is analysed, attention is first directed to general elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be ranked (1) in political <span class="highlight">rights</span> it has to be assumed that the great majority of persons or families in the state have both <span class="highlight">rights</span> and opportunities to participate in the electoral process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Turning to civil <span class="highlight">rights</span>, we are interested first of all in freedom of the Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With a high level of civil <span class="highlight">rights</span>, <span class="highlight">rights</span> are safe for nearly everyone and nearly everywhere against violence or arbitrary action by police or mobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 think that to be ranked one in civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> means that the rule of law is unshaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In states ranked (6) there are no generally accepted civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> that are higher than the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a depressing table in that so many countries all over the globe are ruled by regimes which prevent the majority of the population having any significant political or civil <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was quite depressing to me when I was attending the United Nations to find that so many of the resolutions coming forward criticising other countries for an alleged lack of democracy and of political freedoms were often sponsored by countries which almost never exceeded the six or seven ranking, which represents the bottom of the possibilities for both political and civil <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and that countries where the people obviously have no political or civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> were continuously ranting about alleged interference with freedom in other countries that admittedly also had relatively poor rankings but which certainly were no worse off than the people who were criticising them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The agreement which we are seeking to ratify has been produced as a result of extensive discussions at both ministerial and official level and takes account of the interests and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In passing the powers from the Australian Parliament to that of Papua New Guinea the legislation does not canvass the implications of fishing and the intertwining of fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span> in areas that are adjacent to both countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no dispute about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the indigenous Papuan New Guinea fishermen operating in waters in the Torres Strait and elsewhere where the 2 countries traditionally or Papua New Guineans in particular and people from the Torres Strait Islands have exercised their fishing interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of course also true that as far as ocean resources are concerned the question of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of countries which have extensive ocean boundaries is under discussion within various law of the sea conferences that are being conducted around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the resolution of the extent of territorial waters, I believe that it is important for countries like Papua New Guinea and Australia not only to gain the maximum jurisdiction over these waters but also to ensure that they take advantage of the fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span> within those waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there can be an effective relationship between our 2 countries provided that Papua New Guinea does not grant <span class="highlight">rights</span> that are too easily won, or should I say that do not involve reasonable conditions and restraints on those who might want to go into ventures that the Government of Papua New Guinea may propose or that others may propose to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the very success of those policies the Opposition has used its numbers to oppose the reform of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, to oppose anti-discrimination legislation- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the great defender of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this House against the Senate, the member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  will give his advice on this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There will inevitably be a great shortage of standard ward beds for many years, and poorer people who in some States, for example Victoria, have had special <span class="highlight">rights</span> to beds in public hospitals will now have to compete with the richer elements in the community for these beds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker,  you would not even allow a full and proper examination of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of one of the members of this House because you wanted to shelter and protect the Prime Minister who, I believe, then commenced an operation which highlighted the lack of integrity standards and principles of this man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-14-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the population of the Territory was then small, the member so chosen was not granted full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For most of the period since 1948, the people of Canberra were very ably represented by the late Jim Fraser and, as a result of his agitation, the member for the Australian Capital Territory was given full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this House as from 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government believes that it should be debated today because it is designed amongst other things to protect in every way Australia’s assets and to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a Bill which we believe is fundamental to the safeguarding of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suspension of Standing Orders is designed to deny us on this side of the Parliament an opportunity even to identify the way by which this Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill will destroy the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States and will destroy the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All that the Government is doing is postponing the day when this Parliament can consider the Appropriation Bills, upon which so much of the future and so much of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Australian people must hinge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have said, this Government by its action this afternoon in introducing 3 Bills of fundamental national importance which affect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual and the financial prosperity of every life insurance policy holder in Australia, and in allowing the time which it has allowed for debate has reduced government in this country to a farce, and the sooner the Government grasps the nettle that we have put in front of it and sends this Parliament to the people, the better it will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A quick reading of this Bill has shown that it raises many grave questions in the constitution field, in the area of State <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and even of its own validity as a viable piece of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would point out that in addition to endeavouring to have an improved airport provided I have also endeavoured to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people whose homes will be acquired and are being acquired because of the action which will take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am surprised that the Minister for Housing and Construction would support such a measure because he, above all people, as a member of the Public Works Committee, was a champion of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the little people to have a voice in big government expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister’s attention also been drawn to the pre-election speech of the Prime Minister in which he said that the Australian Labor Party will establish once and for all Aborigines’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> to land and insist that, whatever the law of George III says, a tribe and a race with an identity of centuriesofmillenia is proprietary company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister’s Policy Speech said: We will establish once and for all Aborigines’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> to land and insist that whatever the law of George III says, a tribe and a race with an identity of centuriesmillenia - is as much entitled to own land as even a proprietary company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I must say to you that we would hope that in this coming parliamentary period you will be able to see that this is a volatile place, that people, on occasion, will want to defend their <span class="highlight">rights</span> as strongly as they know how, and that you,  Mr Speaker,  have a responsibility to ensure that every member of this House has his <span class="highlight">rights</span> assured through your agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Legislation will also be introduced to supersede certain provisions of the Queensland Aborigines Act and Torres Strait Islanders Act which are contrary to the principles embodied in the Racial Discrimination Convention and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Government has accepted in principle the recommendations contained in the Second Report of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission and following consultation with Northern Territory Aboriginals will legislate to give effect to its policy on granting land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to these Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recent comment by Sheik Yamani, the Saudi Arabian Minister for Minerals and Energy was that they would not produce in excess of the cash flow which they would need to develop their own country and beyond that they did not choose to be paid in currency of doubtful value and certainly not in special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> from the International Monetary Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, what the Labor Party is seeking to do is to have elected to the Senate people who will not be given the same opportunity to express a point of view as other senators because they are to be constricted in their voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They consider that this is a monstrous piece of legislation; that it has been badly conceived and poorly drawn up, that it gives unfettered, enormous power to an authority, a Minister and a government over which Parliament has little scrutiny; that it conflicts with many of the sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States in the handling of mineral affairs; that it gives to the authority and the Minister enormous power to acquire mineral projects in Australia; and that it gives the authority unlimited advantages which discriminate very severely against private mining operations in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In considering the legislation it also needs to be borne in mind that most non-bank financial institutions are already subject to supervision under State or Territory laws which deal primarily with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of borrowers and lenders and the financial stability of companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Seat of Government Acceptance Act 1909-1955 gave the Australian Government paramount <span class="highlight">rights</span> over the waters of the Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To think that any member would deny the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a fellow elected member to put a point of view would always be beyond me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So, I suggest to honourable members on both sides of the House that it is not necessary to put pressure on the Australian Government but to put pressure on the State governments, irrespective of their political persuasion, to make them recognise that this is a case where States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> are nonsense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> which are important, and that means all the people along the River Murray in all the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He put forward this week the outline of a manpower policy and, above all, he has put forward a scheme which is designed to train trade union officials at all levels so that they may exercise their power with responsibility and skill, and with the motive of ensuring that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of employees shall be protected and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the community will not be harmed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been some criticism of this approach particularly from State premiers on the grounds that it infringes State <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only in the last 18 months has an Australian government begun to recognise the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The recommendations contained in the report go a long way to meeting the demands of the Aboriginal people within the limits of the terms of the Commission, which were essentially on the question of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The report essentially recognises the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginal people to have control over land on which they live through a lands commission of Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report does not deal with land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the States nor with other areas of recognition of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill provides the power to take away all <span class="highlight">rights</span> to continue with work regardless of previous expenditure or undertakings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is power to take away all <span class="highlight">rights</span> to continue with work regardless of previous expenditure or undertakings and this discretion is left to the Minister and not to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to off-shore minerals other than petroleum, the Commonwealth is of the view that it should proceed on the footing that it enjoys total <span class="highlight">rights</span> outside the 3-mile limit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the sovereignty issue is not, strictly speaking, sub judice it certainly needs to be resolved before anybody will know what the true position is as to who has the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and whether the Commonwealth law can be said to be legal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Part I and Part II of that enactment include a claim by the Commonwealth to sovereignty and to sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> in respect of the territorial sea and internal waters excluding those that were subject to State sovereignty in 1900 and including not only internal waters but also the continental shelf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time it should provide funds to enable the States to establish consumer affairs bureaus to advise consumers of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and to provide them with legal aid in appropriate cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quite obviously the Opposition is more concerned with the interests and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of manufacturers and the people it represents than in protecting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of consumers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Opposition has its way we will have 6 pieces of legislation in the States which have added to the confusion and have affected the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the consumers in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was not surprised that the honourable member for Wentworth came forward with the old States <span class="highlight">rights</span> argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that we should be talking about States <span class="highlight">rights</span> or Federal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are talking about is the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Australian individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will provide powerful reinforcement for, and give great impetus to, efforts already made to protect consumers and to develop consciousness of consumers’ <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But more often than not, we are quite ignorant of our <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges as consumers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are proposing in this Bill is a consumers’ charter, that is, a bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Australians as consumers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To recapitulate, related to this Bill and involved in this Bill are four fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span>: The right to be safe, as proposed in clause 62; the right to know, as proposed by clause 63; the right to choose, and the right to be heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is where this legislation really is a farce as an influence on inflation because obviously if it takes that length of time to help consumers and business people to determine what are their <span class="highlight">rights</span>, it will take all that time before it will have any effect on prices, insofar as that is an objective, and have an effect on inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, whereas in Queensland there has been a move in one direction, in South Australia there has been another and there has been a possibility for experimenting in different ways by which the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the consumer can best be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under a Federal system with each of the States enacting its own specific consumer protection legislation, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the citizen are best protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>unenforceable in so far as it confers <span class="highlight">rights</span> or benefits or imposes duties or obligations on a corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A contract in restraint of trade or commerce whether made before or after the commencement of this sub-section is unenforceable in so far as it confers <span class="highlight">rights</span> or benefits or imposes duties or obligations on a corporation but nothing in this sub-section shall render unenforceable any provision in such a contract which is not in restraint of trade or commerce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should enforce all the law of the land and, as far as possible, enable the citizen to have all his <span class="highlight">rights</span>, whatever the source of the law, determined in the one trial court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I shall demonstrate, it will not enable people to have their <span class="highlight">rights</span> determined in one court irrespective of the law, Federal or State, which is the source of those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Constitution in chapter III there is provision for it to be exercised by 3 distinct bodies - by the High Court itself; by a Federal court created by this Parliament, and that is what the Government is seeking to do under this Bill; and by section 77 (iii) which provides the means to enable <span class="highlight">rights</span> and duties under Commonwealth law to be enforced in State courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One other matter which is extremely important and which has created a tremendous problem in the United States of America is that if the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill finds it way into Federal law, and in the unlikely event of the High Court upholding it to be valid, this Superior Court would be able to direct its writs to the judgments of the State Supreme Courts, with consequent tension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, if one sued in relation to a simple contract debt one could not sue on that :n a Federal court but one could sue on a cheque because the <span class="highlight">rights</span> under the cheque are ascribable to the Bills of Exchange Act under Federal law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other fields it has proved useless to confer abstract <span class="highlight">rights</span>, however enlightened, upon people without giving them also a tribunal to which they can go, confident in the knowledge that their <span class="highlight">rights</span> will he cheaply and speedily enforced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The function of law  is  to regulate the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens between and among themselves and their relationship to the State - that is to say, to the State in its corporate sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are going to determine our law by prejudice, by instinct, by volition, or by spontaneous response, then, as the great Edmund Burke reminds us, we will finish in disaster because man cannot enjoy the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a civil and an uncivil society together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A man or woman goes to court to have his or her <span class="highlight">rights</span> litigated or responsibilities settled, not to have some dry jurisdictional problem settled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe in the enrichment which can come from diversity, but not when it comes to waste; not when it comes to atavistic, backward-looking theories which come back in over-simplistic terms to States <span class="highlight">rights</span> as though States were people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before he makes charges of the kind he made tonight he should look at the sorry and deplorable record of the former Government for attending to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members of the Opposition in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to honourable members opposite - and I see them sitting in various corners of this Parliament - that whatever they may say great improvements have been made in the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, as distinct from the provision in the Bill, means that the matter will have to be placed before Parliament and that Parliament will have <span class="highlight">rights</span> in respect to the appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has perhaps been indicated by its attitude to the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It stands as a watchdog between the actions of the Government or the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Amendment of these sections is necessary to afford residents of territories the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> as are afforded to residents of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One has been referred to by previous speakers in this debate, and that is the relative <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the mining interests and Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another member of the Legislative Council - from memory I think it was  Dr Letts  - expressed concern about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people who had had their property acquired by the Government in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What worries me is that nobody seemed to be speaking up for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people who do not have any land, people who want to acquire, housing at reasonable cost in a town where land prices are excessively high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I urge the Government to look at the question of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of minority interests, because I fear that at the present stage of the political development of the Northern Territory we. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>might well find that people in tie underprivileged minorities will have their <span class="highlight">rights</span> trampled upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, this presents a challenge for us to search around and to discover new and more efficient ways to provide health services while, at the same time, maintaining <span class="highlight">rights</span> of choice, freedom of quality of care and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In moving in this direction, as it has attempted to do in the past, the Government is ignoring the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities it ought to have in mind of the individual members of the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation is important because it relates to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual rank and file members of the trade union movement and to the responsibility that the Government ought to accept to ensure that the proper rules for registration under the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act are designed to maintain and enhance those <span class="highlight">rights</span> and not to belittle them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister were really sincere in wanting the rank and file membership of the union to have their <span class="highlight">rights</span> protected, he would agree that this is the best possible way of doing that and that it is the best possible way of seeing to it that every member of an organisation can, without fear and without favour, have a view on a particular question and put that view in such a manner that it will count. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again that provision runs in the face of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities of the rank and file members of the union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the odd things about the Minister is that when he wants to attack union officials and appeal over their heads to the shop stewards and to the rank and file membership, he is doing everything he can, in his words, to uphold the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the rank and file membership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now he has an opportunity to do so but instead he brings in a measure which would deny the membership those <span class="highlight">rights</span> and deny the position of the rank and file members in organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other grounds for objection, and these other grounds strike in the same direction, namely, the removal of <span class="highlight">rights</span> from members of unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be other rules of a union, an organisation, that certainly affect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual members of an organisation, and those rules in the case of an amalgamation can be changed in such a way as would affect those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These things can be done under cover of an amalgamation arrangement, and at the same time the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual members of a union, an organisation, are further reduced because in relation to those unions which have a collegiate system of election, where there is not direct election by the rank and file, the Minister is inserting a provision which states that for 3 years after amalgamation the rank and file members will not get a vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an argument about <span class="highlight">rights</span> and whether or not people ought to be allowed to do certain things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again we get back to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual members about which I thought the Minister would show more concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the honourable member made great play of the fact that somebody was ignoring the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He seemed to suggest that as it was only a requirement to have a ballot, that in some way ignored the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of rank and file members of unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst it may be theoretically convenient to limit the number of unions by amalgamation, it is not desirable to interfere with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals who responsibly establish organisations and unions so that matters pertaining to their occupation or interest can be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a member of the Opposition, I view the Bill now before the House as an infringement on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals and dangerous to the members of unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that if the honourable gentleman’s concern for the protection of <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the rank and file is as genuine as he has stated it to be on a number of occasions before this House he would retain the protection of a secret ballot by postal voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He himself has fought with a union in the past and he used the machinery of the law to assert the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of an individual member, and he won. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avenues will be available to them to ensure that their <span class="highlight">rights</span> can be effectively protected in law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The USSR has been consistently evading and violating the covenants it has signed in regard to human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Soviet Union has demonstrated the most utter hypocrisy in regard to human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and I think it is time that the Government officially associated itself with a protest in the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask now that the Government officially bring to the notice of the United Nations the consistent violation of all human <span class="highlight">rights</span> which the Soviet Union is perpetrating against its .own citizens inside its own borders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They started before the election and demanded <span class="highlight">rights</span> equal to those which had been given to the ALP members who had been allocated the relieving typing pool to help them in their bid for re-election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same thing would have happened in South Australia except for the outspokenness displayed by the honourable member for Boothby and  Senator Jessop  and their preparedness to stand up for their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is to be condemned for its continued confrontation with the State governments and the undermining of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless, we believe we can still work with these amendments and strive to protect the contributors’ interests and at the same time, as we indicated was our intention at the time we brought the original Bill into the House, preserve the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contributors’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> were not being properly attended to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have mentioned examples of the denial of citizen <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, there is a total denial of all citizen <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Upper House of New South Wales, for which nobody has to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equality of political <span class="highlight">rights</span> is inherent in a truly democratic state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equality of political <span class="highlight">rights</span> is a matter that must be guaranteed under the law in a democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But,  Mr Chairman,  equality of political <span class="highlight">rights</span>, equality of voting value and equality of political representation cannot be guaranteed in a situation where electorates which vary in size from less than 4 square miles to almost 900,000 square miles, are required under law to have virtually equal numbers of electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party could not care less about the democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australian citizens to enjoy equality of representation in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We of the Australian Country Party would be failing in our duty if we did not fight with all our power to protect the limited <span class="highlight">rights</span> of country people and to fight to secure for country people something approaching the equality of representation to which they, as Australian citizens, are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He says democracy is frail in Australia because one chamber of this Parliament is prepared to exercise its <span class="highlight">rights</span> which it was guaranteed under the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, mindful of its mandate and responsibility, is determined to ensure that the Australian electoral laws embrace those fundamental principles of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and democracy in this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having taken the proposal for the Joint Sitting once to the High Court, it has even said it is going to take it there again and so deny the people their democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill gives expression to the democratic principles of equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> for all people, as opposed to the manipulation of the electoral system for the benefit of political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is assumed that electorates will be so drawn as to ensure that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people are put above the convenience of political parties and members thereof. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The justification for the Senate was the preservation of State <span class="highlight">rights</span>, not the destruction of votes for city people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because of a double dissolution caused by senators who are elected on the basis that they will look after State <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What about his <span class="highlight">rights</span>, his children, their educational facilities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, there must be proper Executive power to any Government, but our British, our English idea, in a special sense, has always been a system of balanced <span class="highlight">rights</span> and divided authority, with many other persons and organised bodies having to be considered besides the Government of the day and the officials they employ . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These proposed laws do not deal with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of political parties; they deal with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of our people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This right is emphasised in Article 22 of The Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their representatives in this chamber have full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> along with all the other members who meet in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the instance of the Government the people of the Australian Capital Territory now have 2 members in the House of Representatives enjoying full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1970, the then Leader of the Opposition- the present Prime Minister- tried again, out of a recognition of the pretty fundamental and basic fact that a large number of people in the Northern Territory and in the Australian Capital Territory are without their democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to stop the passage of our measures, every action must be invoked to prevent the democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people being enacted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite their <span class="highlight">rights</span> as Australians and their undisputed <span class="highlight">rights</span> as electors, the people of the Northern Territory have been denied the opportunity to elect representatives to both Houses of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That occurred on 1 January 1911 and it denied the people of the Northern Territory all electoral <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a number of years  Mr. H.  Nelson, father of the present Administrator of the Northern Territory, fought incessantly in this House for full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>, because although he was the representative of the Northern Territory he had no voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it was not until 1968, after the present Administrator of the Northern Territory,  Mr Jock  Nelson, had made many a stirring speech in this House in relation to representation for the Northern Territory, full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> for its representative and Senate representation, that the honourable member for the Northern Territory in fact received full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the Parliament look with great pride to when this vote will be taken, because when the vote is taken we will see a majority of votes- as is needed under the Constitution- in this Joint Sittingto give the people of the Northern Territory the just <span class="highlight">rights</span> for which they have been fighting since 1911. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other argument, of course, is that senators representing the Territories would be sectionalists and would be arguing for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are they the words of a zealous custodian of States <span class="highlight">rights</span> or are they the words of a jugular vein politician who is determined to use the Senate merely to reverse the freely expressed will of the people of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In moving to diminish the limits of power of the States through the Senate, the Government is taking another bold step to violate State <span class="highlight">rights</span> by eroding the Senate’s power, influence and prestige. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way that the people of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory can exercise their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and their duties as free and equal Australians citizens is for them to be represented wherever there are representative institutions, including the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Now it comes to political <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is late in the day, but the decisions we will make this evening will deliver equal political <span class="highlight">rights</span> to all citizens in Australia, no matter where they live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that as the member for the Northern Territory he might have been able to explain to us how it is that when the Opposition approaches the voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those people who are entitled to a vote it says that their electorates should be gerrymandered, and when it comes to the voting entitlements of those people who are not entitled to vote it says they should not be able to vote at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Piltdown men opposite would tell us that, because a group of politicians amongst whom the Labor Movement was almost totally unrepresented, if not totally unrepresented, almost 80 years ago decided to devise a Constitution whose purpose would be to preserve the property <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the wealthy citizens of that day, to withstand the scourge of the Peasants’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1968 he, along with the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory, finally gained full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Worst of all, its inequity and the way that it neglects so many people in the community indicate that it is inappropriate to a wealthy country which makes some claim to a commitment to respect for human dignity and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the inherent strengths and weaknesses of human nature, as soon as the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and incentives of the professional man to practise in a free, competitive society are taken away and he is forced to work in a government machine, creative achievements, ingenious new techniques, break-throughs in knowledge and further explorations of the perplexing problems of mankind cease and we are all reduced to a level of mediocrity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my opinion, a vote against this Bill is a vote against the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of good health of one million Australians who are uninsured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The competitive granting of mineral exploration <span class="highlight">rights</span> on absurd terms in the name of progress has resulted in the States, in many cases, being allowed to usurp national functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is only IS per cent Australian equity in the consortium holding off-shore exploration <span class="highlight">rights</span> on the North West Continental Shelf of Western Australia, where 142,000 square miles of one of the world ‘s largest potential natural gas areas are held by it- an area beyond the full capacity of even the largest company to intensively explore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have refused applications from it to agree to the transfer of its obligations by ‘farm-out’ to other companies on a 50-50 basis, ignoring the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australian sovereignty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It conflicts with the sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States and it confuses existing Commonwealth laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This proposal offends the principles of democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> which we believe are so precious to a democratic society, and mean so very much to the spirit and the life of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Authority would simply override the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far from having been required to cede some of the foreign equity in exchange for these great extensions of mining <span class="highlight">rights</span> over ore deposits which are among the very best in the world, Hamersley has rather been able, on the strength of these assurances of reserves, to demand and get premiums of about 500 per cent in selling thin slices of the equity to Australian investors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is manifestly clear, even from the most cursory reading of the Bill, that one of its particular purposes is to seek to override States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> of participation in the oil and mineral industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the chamber recognise this as a serious precedent that would erode the principle of States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> in <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the House that the Government, which has undoubted <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations to govern, nevertheless through its election of a  Speaker  and the conduct of affairs here has the obligation to allow Opposition members to speak and to ensure that rulings are fair and that the House is equitably run. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is good enough for the United States Government to subsidise factories in that country in order to retain employees in their jobs, surely this socialist Government that purports to be so dedicated to providing full employment would be quite within its <span class="highlight">rights</span> to subsidise our munitions factories to the extent of maintaining jobs for employees there and also the jobs of employees in private factories which supply extra parts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#debate-84">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is important not for me but because I believe that the proper adherence to the forms of this House and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members is something which we should all guard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should also be said that the proposed law would certainly be in breach of many of the provisions of the international covenant on civil and political <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not want to debate at this stage the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or wrongs of that situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740925_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main purpose of this Bill is to amend certain provisions of the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Act 1956-73 in order to alter the name of the Commission; increase the number of Commissioners from five to seven; make specific provision for the appointment of a full time Chairman of the Commission; to alter the basis on which the Commission is reimbursed for losses in the operation of a shipping service undertaken at the direction of the Minister for Transport; and to eliminate an anomaly in the present Act relating to <span class="highlight">rights</span> and benefits of the Commission’s officers formerly employed in the Australian Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This latter sub-section of the Act purports to give officers of the Commission who were formerly employed in the Australian Public Service the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> and benefits as if they remained in the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">rights</span> and benefits are enjoyed by officers in other statutory authorities, such as Commonwealth Railways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is without meaning for the reason that Public Service <span class="highlight">rights</span> and benefits are given pursuant to appointments under section 22 only, whereas appointment of officers is authorised only under section 2 1 and 23. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That provision meant that in the absence of any other provision a public servant had to resign and forfeit his <span class="highlight">rights</span> to superannuation and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How often have we heard from retired people that the absence of fringe benefits that are available to people enjoying the <span class="highlight">rights</span> under the pensioner medical service is one of the things that they find most irritating, anomalous and unjust? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The other matter with which the honourable member for Griffith and other Opposition members must deal is how they will assert their <span class="highlight">rights</span> through the democratic processes available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact the countries of the world which have been given the option of taking up their selling <span class="highlight">rights</span>- the producers’ club- are letting their <span class="highlight">rights</span> pass beyond them to the next producer because they are waiting to sell at the right price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order that these entitlements will not be wasted and to add further stimulus to the legislation, the Bill introduces a provision which will enable an organisation which does not intend to take advantage of its <span class="highlight">rights</span> to transfer them in whole or in pan to another eligible organisation, subject to the approval of the Director-General of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It follows that perhaps something should be done quickly to ensure that there are some statutory <span class="highlight">rights</span> for members of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I undertake to the honourable member that we will look at this matter as one of urgency to ensure that members of Parliament are no longer deprived the <span class="highlight">rights</span> which are applicable to other members of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the then Minister for Trade and Industry,  Sir John  McEwen, had not taken the initiative in bringing in the Book Bounty Bill of that day it is quite safe to say that the industry would have passed the point of no return and that the quite considerable body of book publishing which is generated in this countrythe works of Australian authors, the works of authors from overseas for which <span class="highlight">rights</span> are bought by Australian publishers- would all have gone on outside Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When did the conservative parties of this countrythe Liberal and Country parties- ever talk about passing legislation that would enshrine the principles of a bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span>, of personal and human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, in the Australian system of law? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the question of the need for plant breeders <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has been slow to take up the question of plant breeders <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but the same cannot be said for other countries of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many reasons why plant breeders <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation is necessary, but I will quote only a few. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is right for the inventor to be recognised in secondary industry, it is surely right to legislate for plant breeders’ <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But many of these new varieties are no longer available to Australia because of the lack of the necessary protective legislation, namely, legislation to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of plant breeders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why we cannot obtain these overseas strains is that Australia has no reciprocal legislation to guarantee the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of breeders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another of the provisions in the Bill is to eliminate an anomaly in the present Act relating to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and benefits of the Commission’s officers formerly employed by the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of the Australian Shipping Commission Bill, as outlined by the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones),  is to amend certain provisions of the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Act 1956-73 in order to alter the name of the Commission, to increase the number of Commissioners from five to seven, to make specific provision for the appointment of a full time  chairman  of the Commission- a very worthwhile amendment because of the increasing importance of the Commission- to alter the basis on which the Commission is to be reimbursed for the losses in operation of the shipping services undertaken at the direction of the Minister for Transport, and to eliminate an anomaly in the present Act relating to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and benefits of the Commission’s officers formerly employed in the Australian Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

D. Butler. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is probably the person in this House best known as a close supporter of the sort of views expressed by the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in Australia <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its report the Australian Country Party described the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> as having a disreputable and racist basis, which it is now trying to conceal; declared the disciples of social credit, which Butler advocates, as sheer fanatics; quoted some of his writings on the communist conspiracy, which it then categorises as ‘the language of paranoia’; spoke of Butler’s violent opposition to parliamentary government, his long catalogue of hates; and stated that there is something breathtaking about lunacy on this scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No, I will not take advantage of it, but I think it is important, when a sitting member of this Parliament becomes identified with the Immigration Control Association or the National Director of the Australian League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, that it is made clear that he does not speak for the whole of his Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of that Committee is to consider and to report to the Attorney-General on what legislative measures are desirable in the fulfilment of the general right to privacy, provided for in article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, with particular reference to: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, clause 19 of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill 1973 would give effect to article 17 of the International Covenant in Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, which requires persons to be protected against arbitrary or unlawful interference with their privacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hypocritical to claim State <span class="highlight">rights</span> and then argue against the States accepting a responsibility in this sphere of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think if the Minister, taking him at his face value, really wishes to preserve some <span class="highlight">rights</span> for State branches he will look at the suggestion very closely indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman is perfectly correct in saying that this piece of legislation cannot alter existing property <span class="highlight">rights</span>, whatever they may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite the honourable member for Stirling  (Mr Viner)  to turn his attention to clause 9 of the Bin which seeks to give protection against a Federal organisation preventing members exercising their <span class="highlight">rights</span> within a State industrial system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not and cannot inhibit the <span class="highlight">rights</span> that any union has now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will protect those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only last weekend we saw Press articles purporting to suggest that members of Parliament had different <span class="highlight">rights</span> in relation to taxation from other persons when, in fact, every person in the community who receives an overnight allowance does not have that questioned provided he does not claim more for expenses than the amount allowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members who are expected to vote for Government policies in the Parliament should be entitled to exercise their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to challenge matters when they consider it necessary and to express opinions on decisions of a smaller group of their members, no matter what positions they may happen to hold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What these Press articles are saying is that the only <span class="highlight">rights</span> that members of the public have in electing members to Parliament- this applies equally to Opposition members- is that they shall vote on election day, that those they elect shall come to Canberra and vote for a leader and having chosen that leader for the next 3 years they will have no right to exercise any authority over that leader or members of the Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I find to be tragic is the way that those of us who sit in Parliaments have allowed the Press to take over from us the predominant role in safeguarding the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people in the modern community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people; it is a matter of bringing people back into the democratic process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am satisfied that when, as we now know will be the case, the Gurindji people receive the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for which they have been waiting at Wattie Creek for the past 6 years they will go ahead and build a viable community, and that they will go ahead and develop a viable cattle enterprise on the land which they take over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the right to strike carries with it, like all <span class="highlight">rights</span>, certain duties and responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right to strike is one of the prized and protected <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Australian worker, but only when negotiations have failed and there are no other weapons open to the worker to pursue the justice he seeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it because the Government wants control of the media so that we cannot object to the programs that are being put on because we are not paying television licence fees and therefore have no <span class="highlight">rights</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are basic <span class="highlight">rights</span>, one would think, that a person should have, and if they are refused there ought to be some right to have the matter reviewed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attorney-General, when preparing this legislation, will give careful thought to whether, in his desire to protect human <span class="highlight">rights</span> about which he speaks often, he will at least protect the citizen from the decisions of Ministers of the Crown which may be just as defective because Ministers rely on the advice and support of bureaucratic people in making their decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that these are areas of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> which are of tremendous importance to people in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill, in my estimation, is not nearly as important as the administrative review procedures that could be introduced into Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognised that a great need existed for legal services, whether those services be required to defend a person charged with a criminal offence, to assist a person to assert his legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> in a civil cause, or to enable a person to defend himself against some charge brought against him by some other citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when it comes to the poor man wishing to go to court and to assert his legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> nothing was done by the former Government to assist him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal and Country Parties believe in State <span class="highlight">rights</span> to such an extent that they believe the States should be the only parts of Australia to have their own company laws so that those people who are inclined to exploit the system can take advantage of the fact that this country has 8 different sets of company laws- including the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members care to take the time and look at our platform which is in a written, published form- we began publishing our platforms and policies long before the Liberal and Country Parties did- they will find pages dealing with the importance we attach to civil liberties and to human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally, it is unsatisfactory to contemplate a renewal of exploration <span class="highlight">rights</span> on 72,000 square miles for which the present Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act provides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it had the advantage of disciplining unions, because if there is a large army of people waiting for a job at the factory door it is less likely that those inside the factory will want to change their jobs, it is less likely that they will want to go on strike and, indeed, it is less likely that they will even fight and stick up for their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Lilley, who has just spoken, was himself a victim of the callous disregard evidenced by the former Government for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people to have a job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and wrongs of that statement were, and I think it had more wrong than right in it, the fact is that there was a deliberate decision to create unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of background, I might explain that voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> are based on subscriptions to IDA. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By general consensus, it had been decided that the additional resources put at IDA’s disposal under the first and second replenishments should not affect existing voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was done by permitting countries to make additional subscriptionswhich carry voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>- to IDA as well as contributions under the third replenishment, the relative proportions between the two varying in each instance so as to produce the overall adjustments in voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> desired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complex calculations undertaken by the staff of IDA indicate that, of the total amount which Australia is expected to make available to IDA over the next few years, the equivalent of US$590,525- that is $A399,003 calculated on the same basis as before- should take the form of an additional subscription with voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister also recognises the need to provide pension <span class="highlight">rights</span> to a greater degree for de facto wives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It domonstrates that this man is not in fact sympathetic with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and opportunities of the family farmer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General has in mind making available to honourable members the contents of the report that he receives, subject to proper consideration being given to <span class="highlight">rights</span> of particular individuals as they might be affected by it and having regard to any court proceedings that may be possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it abolishes basic existing <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people, substitutes apparent benefits which are not described with clarity and which are at the unfettered discretion of bureaucrats, and leaves many people worse off than under their existing legal <span class="highlight">rights</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister knows that the trade union movement is against it and that there is a ground swell among workers against it because they feel that their <span class="highlight">rights</span> are being taken away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to some of the inequities in and the loss of existing <span class="highlight">rights</span> under the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accident victims are given no <span class="highlight">rights</span> to challenge unfavourable evidence on the basis set out in the report, namely, that any contest is bad for their rehabilitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does abolish present compensation schemes and with them the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and remedies which exist throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further question in this respect concerns the protection that will be given to the existing <span class="highlight">rights</span> of policy holders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The initial step should be for the Commonwealth to provide compensation for those who have a high level of disability assessed irrespective of whether those injured or sick are congenitally so or have become so later in life, and irrespective of whether they have <span class="highlight">rights</span> at common law or under the workers compensation Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the House should be immensely indebted to the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott)  for warning us of the consequences involved, if at some time in the future, taking the assumption that this legislation is passed, the Bill comes into form and is an Act, is challenged and it is found that the purported extinguishing and abolition of the common law <span class="highlight">rights</span>, which is postulated in clauses 9 1 and 92 of the Bill, was not validly made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also agree with the honourable member for Wentworth on the proposition that if the elimination of common law <span class="highlight">rights</span> is not upheld constitutionally as being one of the powers of this Parliament, then the whole Bill has little point to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both the common law right and workers compensation actions have been the subject of legal fictions because the courts have striven to give compensation beyond the original boundaries of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-33-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government not recognise that, firstly, the community does not want any more huge inefficient Government departments, and secondly, that there will be widespread retrenchments in the insurance industry if the workers compensation and common law <span class="highlight">rights</span> of action disappear from the field of the insurance industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-33-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very easy for members of the Government such as the honourable member for Cook to criticise the courts, but the courts and their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to public hearings with representation of witnesses is surely one of the most cherished parts of our entire social and judicial structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-33-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of there being an appeal to a quasi-judicial tribunal is of little comfort when such a major right is taken away in a Bill which would otherwise be introducing some commendable new <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-33-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the view of the Law Council that in making such a basic change to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the seriously injured, by the introduction of an untried scheme of uncertain operation, existing common law <span class="highlight">rights</span> should not be extinguished at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-33-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There must be responsibility universally accepted and shared in return for <span class="highlight">rights</span> comprehensively available and enjoyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, there is the plain fact that <span class="highlight">rights</span> universally enjoyed must be accompanied by obligations universally accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principle of community responsibility embodied in this legislation and the fact that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people are universally covered and that there is 24-hour cover for everyone in the community are aspects of the scheme which must receive the support of this House, and Parliament as a whole and also the support of the community which when they see the benefits that they will receive under this scheme will welcome it with open arms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when the very carefully prepared document of the Law Council of Australia is looked at one can immediately see that this body is not concerned to promote the self-interest of the profession but is really concerned with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of an individual under this scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accident victims lose existing <span class="highlight">rights</span> to challenge unfavourable evidence on the basis set out in the Report that any ‘ contest ‘ is bad for their rehabilitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to expand the present statutory <span class="highlight">rights</span> to guarantee that everybody is covered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have a Party that denigrates the Senate, that is always speaking against Senate committees and alleged Senate interference with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Parliament, that is dedicated to the abolition of the Senate - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the reason for suddenly having this obsession about senatorial <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of that chamber? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More than any other piece of legislation that has come into this Parliament over the course of the past 20 years, this Bill will change fundamentally the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of every individual Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We seek this because we believe that we cannot fundamentally change the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Australian citizenry without permitting those who are the elected representatives of those Australian citizens to deliberate adequately upon the measures which are provided in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that every honourable member on the Government side, if he is honest to himself and honest to the charge which his electoral <span class="highlight">rights</span> bestow upon him, would also support it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new clause 98a now provides similar <span class="highlight">rights</span>, in all circumstances, in the one clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been pointed out in this place that there is some constitutional doubt as to the validity of this Bill and that if the High Court decides that the Bill does not abolish common law <span class="highlight">rights</span> and clauses 92 and so on of the Bill are therefore invalid, very grave consequences will occur to the Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only regions to which the Government appears to be paying a little attention are the Burdekin basin, Pilbara in Western Australia, the Bowen basin in Queensland, Mount Isa in Queensland and the Kimberleys in Western Australia, and the attention paid to some of these appears to be becoming a little dulled by this Government’s attitude to foreign investments and to State’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have had problems with Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and there are now environmental considerations that have been taken into account over quite a period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third point it made was that State governments had been giving <span class="highlight">rights</span> to vast mineral deposits, some of which had resource lives of up to 150 years, to the same companies for quite minimal royalties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>BHP-Esso and WoodsideBurmah on the North- West Shelf cannot even get an extension of their exploration <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are certainly not interested in depriving them of royalties; we are not interested in their fisheries <span class="highlight">rights</span>; we are not interested in the off-shore operations of their civil and criminal codes; but we are very much interested in making sure that, for the first time, there will be really intensive drilling on the North- West Shelf which covers 142,000 square miles and is one of the best and richest resources of natural gas in the world today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The assistance will carry inventors up to the point where they will be able to get their patent <span class="highlight">rights</span> in certain circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think we should keep this very much in mind when Government supporters talk about how they defend the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the lower income and middle income groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So do not let this Government say that it is the defender of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the migrants any more, because in fact it is working against the migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they find that they have been deprived of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> because of the lapse of time- not by any action of the Governmentthey can lay the blame on the honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for New England because they have wasted all this time trying to raise an issue that was not even specified in the matter for discussion and can well be canvassed in the debate on the estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill provides for the staff of EPIC to be transferred to the new Corporation without loss of their existing <span class="highlight">rights</span> or privileges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be recalled that during his speech he referred, among other things, to the ‘inalienable <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all people to freedom and independence’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I think of the previous calls in this Parliament and elsewhere by Labor regarding the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of nations and people to selfdetermination I realise how utterly hypocritical those calls become when viewed against the bowing by the Government to the pressure of Soviet colonialism in the case of the Baltic States and its pre-judging the free expression of the Timorese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Article 1, section 3 of the United Nations Charter states that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to promote and encourage respect for human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last 2 weeks it has been brought to the attention of this chamber that an Eastern European diplomat had the courage of his convictions to go to an Australian embassy and ask for political asylum and that this Government which is prepared to stand up in the United Nations and talk about the freedom of the individual and the need for political asylum, refused that man his individual <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same Government is the first one to stand up and say that it stands for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual, that it is a government which believes that all nations must base their policies on the principle of independence, and that it is a government which says that all nations must be free and equal; yet when one man had the courage to come forward and ask for its help the Government turned him away at the door. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia cannot therefore connive at the denial of these <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the Timorese people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that 3,500 men then stood to lose their jobs could only have obscured, in the public mind, whatever justification the State might have been able to offer as part of its stand on the protection of States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has indicated in its report on consumer policy in member countries that there is now general acceptance of the need for governments to take action to reinforce the consumer’s position with these objectives in mind: To protect the consumer against hazards to safety and health; to protect the consumer against deceptive and other unfair practices; to provide the consumer with adequate <span class="highlight">rights</span> and means of redress; to provide information and education to facilitate a sound choice by the consumer, and to facilitate the proper exercise of the consumer’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>; and to involve consumer representatives in the formulation of regulations or other elements of economic policies which concern them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Government’s attitude regarding the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people of Guinea-Bissau towards self-determination the same as the Government’s attitude towards the future of Portuguese Timor; if not, what are the differences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-50-96">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not quarrel with the principle of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a Prime Minister and leaders of a Government to travel overseas to ensure that they are up to date with trends and expectations of other nations, but what I do comment on is that on their return it is the right of the Australian people through their Parliament to know what the Prime Minister and the Ministers have learnt by their experiences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is hoped that the new deposit requirements will keep this proliferation of candidates within reasonable proportions, without going so far as to deprive serious intending candidates of their legitimate democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> to present themselves for election to public office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-What we are dealing with in this Bill is a question that has significant ramifications for the States, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was recently told- the honourable member for Hume again implied it about my colleaguesthat I did not support federalism and that I did not support States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My answer then and my answer now is and always will be that I do not; I support people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr CORBETT (Maranoa) ^^^Notwithstanding all my gallantry I must disagree and be at cross-purposes with the honourable member for Henry  (Mrs Child)  who said that she does not support State <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I see it, in supporting State <span class="highlight">rights</span> members of the Opposition are supporting the State <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people of those States, and this is the fundamental issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In depriving the States of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> the Government is depriving the people of the States of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> they now enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to give honourable members a few brief facts in explanation and proof of this claim and I want to remind Queenslanders to look behind the facade, to look behind the false front of respectability, of interest and concern for Queensland people put forward by the Premier, and see what the real facts are, because if they return a National Party-led coalition government in the Queensland elections on 7 December they will in fact have elected the political front for that sinister, subversive, insidious organisation, the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As long ago as 1971 the well-known leader of the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in Australia,  Mr Eric  Butler, made a claim which was reported in the ‘Telegraph’ in Queensland of 24 September 1971 as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He accepts its support and his silence will serve only to prove the truth of the certain but sinister union which exists between the National Party in Queensland and the national socialist front organisation, the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that every honourable member in this House would be well aware, having listened to the honourable member for Prospect on the occasion on which he personally maligned me and failed to apologise for the remarks that he made in linking me with the Australian League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> as a result of completely unsubstantiated and unchecked allegations - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On that occasion you referred specifically to papers that you alleged said what an infamous organisation this League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another new provision will require the value of benefits received under a stock option or share purchase scheme to be measured at the time of the exercise of the option or on the transfer of the shares rather than, as at present, when the <span class="highlight">rights</span> are acquired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Capital expenditure on the development of a mine or oil field, on the provision of community facilities adjacent to a mine or field, or on the purchase of mining <span class="highlight">rights</span> or information will be deductible henceforth over the estimated life of the mine or field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ‘the House, in disapproving of this Bill is of the opinion that the provisions contained in it should be referred to the Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory to enable that Assembly to consider ways by which land prices in the Northern Territory should be stabilised, but requesting that any lands acquisition proposals which might be included in legislation to be considered by that Assembly should protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private land owners and occupiers and be on just terms’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In spite of all the election propaganda about the Labor Party’s concern for people, this Bill reveals that Labor cares nothing about preserving the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point I want to make to the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder),  the honourable member for Boothby  (Mr McLeay)  and the honourable member for Gwydir  (Mr Hunt)  is that under section 5 1 of the Constitution this clause relating to ‘just terms’ was inserted specifically to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States in relation to land acquired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The effect of the Bill will be to bring those of the present judges who were appointed before 1 December 1973, the date on which Papua New Guinea achieved self-Government, under the Australian Judges’ Pensions Act, so that their pension <span class="highlight">rights</span> are guaranteed by Australian legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think this is a most important point which can be overlooked when we speak about the pension <span class="highlight">rights</span> of servicemen and servicewomen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Minister for Services and Property ever gets up again and talks about the onus of proof, about liberty and about the Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, I hope he has to reach for a glass of water, because a person can be fined $200 if he does not comply with the requirements of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this Parliament loses the control and hands over complete power to any statutory corporation we are denying the democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this Parliament, and that is why I have moved the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same honourable members opposite who have the hide to come into this chamber on occasions and talk about wanting to introduce a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in the Parliament have thrown aside all conventions and laws relating to the onus of proof. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the definition; the effect on the local industry; the onus of proof which is the antithesis of what is contained in the Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> which the Government proclaims before us both here and outside the House so frequently; and, finally, enshrining in the legislation the provisions of this Code of the OECD. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>is of opinion that, as a matter of priority, legislation should be introduced to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of ex-nuptial children and, in particular, insofar as the Commonwealth Government is concerned, to remove the word ‘illegitimate’ from all existing Commonwealth legislation and to amend existing Commonwealth legislation to ensure that ex-nuptial children have the right to participate in the same benefits and entitlements that any other child in the community is able to receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But quite clearly the reason there have been no such longitudinal studies in Australia is that no funds have been provided for the purpose and largely because the community, knowing its attitude, has felt that it would be a gross intrusion on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the person to inquire into what has happened to the ex-nuptial child as it has grown older. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will be aware that the Labor Government recognises Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> in land, and moved early in 1 973 to set up an Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission to inquire into and report on appropriate means to recognise and establish Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Northern Territory in the first instance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the former Government did not recognise Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> in land, it did recognise the need of many Aboriginals living outside reserves for land to use and develop for economic and social purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our purpose in seeking the co-operation of the Queensland Government was that the Queensland Government would face up to those obligations that we have accepted under International Labor Organisation conventions, such as the Convention on the <span class="highlight">Rights</span> of Tribal and Indigenous People. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his speech, the Australian Ambassador to the United Nations,  Sir Laurence  Mclntyre, emphasised Australia’s adherence to resolution 242 as the only basis for lasting peace in the Middle East, reaffirmed our strong desire that Israel’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>, as well as the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other States in the area to continued existence within recognised and secure boundaries be acknowledged by all parties to the dispute and declared our preparedness to accept the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, provided this is what the Palestinians wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever reservations we may have about methods employed in asserting those <span class="highlight">rights</span> to self-determination and a recognised place in their original homeland- there is clearly a new and vigorous spirit, a new sense of destiny among the leaders of the displaced Arabs, a new confidence in their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to selfdetermination and independence within a Palestine state of their own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are penalising people throughout Australia largely on a class basis in relation to their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to vote for the upper House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Thousands and thousands of voters throughout New South Wales were denied their <span class="highlight">rights</span> not because they did not want to vote formally, not because they did not want to understand for whom they were voting- they wanted a Labor Government, which they returned in the House of Representatives- but because people were exploiting the system, the old archiac system by which if there are 73 candidates one has to vote one to seventy three. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I thought that the right to vote was one of the democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of every Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provision for mobile polling booths will overcome that to a very large extent, and every effort is required to ensure that all citizens exercise their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a party, person or government seeks, by legal means, to deny a disadvantaged section of the community its voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> this can be achieved by placing complications or difficulties in the way of voting which will prevent a substantial proportion of the population from casting formal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest that any system which makes it easier for people to identify and vote for the candidate or the parties which they choose is a system which advances the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people in a democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have mentioned to the previous member for Sturt on a number of occasions the number of points of order that he took- I can say that many of them were not really points of order- and the number of times that he objected and stood up for what he considered to be his <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 8 seeks to require that the value of benefits received under a stock option or share purchase scheme be measured at the time of the exercise of the option or on the transfer of the shares rather than, as at present, when the <span class="highlight">rights</span> are acquired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will prevent the abuse of the system by offering options at absurdly low market values in relation to their ultimate realisation value and, in some cases, protect those employees from unjustified taxation where <span class="highlight">rights</span> have declined in value prior to the exercise of an option. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Lest it be imagined that my protest has the effect of totally disassociating myself from the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, I would say that this is a matter of small concern to me, apart from my categoric denial that I am a member of the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> or that I hold brief for its purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, can he propose a better method to protect those people who apply for patent <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and pay many hundreds of dollars to seek sole patent <span class="highlight">rights</span>, only then to discover that the process is inefficient enough to fail to establish sole <span class="highlight">rights</span> in a particular field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-44-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was amazed to find when I disclosed recently the inseparable links that exist between the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, that frightening fascist right-wing organisation, and the National Party in Queensland that it appeared obvious that there were even members of the National Party from Queensland who did not realise that those links existed in their own areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We had the situation the other evening of the honourable member for Wide Bay  (Mr Millar)  making a personal explanation and saying that a reflection had been cast on his integrity in suggesting that because he was invited and intended to share a platform with this League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> spokesman,  Mr Eric <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Butler, it might be thought that he was sympathetic to the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was a public meeting called by the fascist right wing organisation League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> that publishes the journal ‘Queensland Calling’ for the Save Our State campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member was billed to be on the platform with H. J.

    <p>The Australian League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> was described by  Mr St  John, a well respected exmember of this Parliament and a recognised Australian authority on the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, in a letter he wrote and which was published in the ‘Australian ‘ on 1 6 July 1 97 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This morning, in referring again to this link between the National Party and the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in Queensland, I think I should state that at the moment the greatest proponents in Queensland of what we have come to know of the Petersen plan are members of the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It follows, to some extent, the matters that were raised by my colleague the honourable member for Bowman  (Mr Keogh),  who from time to time in this House has been exposing the association between the National Party and extreme right wing groups in the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Regent Theatre, as a consequence of the National Trust classification, is designated as a Historic Building in the terms of the recent Historic Buildings Act 1974, the amendments to the Town and Country Planning Act 1 96 1 set down in the Act make it possible for the Minister to permit the unused plot ratio or development <span class="highlight">rights</span> on the site of a designated building to be transferred to another site and sold in order to bring about the preservation of the designated building. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last two of the Horbury Terrace nos 171-173 Macquarie Street have been preserved with a covenant that requires the owner to restore and maintain the facades and the balance of the development <span class="highlight">rights</span> have been transferred to an office building in Put Street. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments to the Town and Country Planning Act provide for the approval of a building of a greater than normally prescribed height and size where the application for the permit is made with the consent of the owner of other land in the City of Melbourne on which a designated building is situated- that is the unused development <span class="highlight">rights</span> are transferred  from  the designated building to another site. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sale of the development <span class="highlight">rights</span> would compensate the owner of the designated building for his inability to develop his site to the maximum and help make it possible for him to preserve the designated building. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>7.30 Although the principle may be clear and is given the public seal of approval in the Historic Buildings Act there are, however, difficult detail problems not yet solved in this system of transferring and selling development <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Town Hall is a Classified Building and is on the list of buildings proposed to be designated under the Act but it is not proposed that the unused development <span class="highlight">rights</span> at a Floor Space Ratio of 10 to 1 on the Town Hall site should be available for sale! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The method of valuation is complicated enough if the development <span class="highlight">rights</span> are transferred to a site with the same square foot value in an area with the same Floor Space Ratio or Plot Ratio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Development <span class="highlight">rights</span> bought would be cheaper in one sense than land if held over a period as presumably municipal rates and taxes would not be levied on them until used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand it is doubtful if transferred development <span class="highlight">rights</span> would ever be worth the maximum equivalent in land value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At 50 per cent of the equivalent land value corresponding to this area of space the value of the development <span class="highlight">rights</span> available for transfer is in the order of $8.5m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the amount of the Star Insurance Co. settlement of $ 1 ,050,000 and the lower estimated amount of $1.4m from the sale of development <span class="highlight">rights</span> are both put towards the equity required there would be insufficient equity by the normal standards of the market place to raise a sufficiently large mortgage to carry out the development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the proportion of mortgage to equity is not fixed in heaven but dependent on the investor and could be varied to give the Council a larger mortgage perhaps in return for the sale of the development <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the investor at a discounted price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>7.34 The most likely and logical purchaser of any space available for transfer, the T &amp; G Mutual Life Society Ltd, raised the question of purchase of development <span class="highlight">rights</span> during discussion with us and expressed interest but as stated earlier they have no intention of redeveloping their site for 8 or 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the T &amp; G are keen to secure an option to purchase the available developments <span class="highlight">rights</span> they could be approached to provide all or pan of the finance required for the development in return for such an option. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The option could be to purchase any or all of the development <span class="highlight">rights</span> at a price to be fixed at the time of purchase on a valuation formula to be agreed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not quarrel with the principle of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a Prime Minister and leaders of a government to travel overseas to ensure that they are up to date with trends and expectations  of other nations, but what I do comment on is that on their return it is the right of the Australian people through their Parliament to know what the Prime Minister and the Ministers have learnt by their experiences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee recommends that in the event of the Commonwealth approving any expansion of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of contributors to friendly society dispensaries to receive rebates for national health scheme prescriptions, other organisations should also be approved to provide similar benefits at private pharmacies on payment of a similar contribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-For the information of honourable members of the present Parliament I present the text of a Convention which has entered into force and to which Australia is considering becoming a party by ratification on Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Day, 10 December- to wit International Labour Organisation Convention No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is the national nature- not the State <span class="highlight">rights</span> oneand the greater scope of control which is exercised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 6 (c) refers to the Australian coastal sea and clause 6(d) states: for purposes related to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> (including sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span>) and obligations of Australia in relation to the continental shelf of Australia; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously those objectives are designed to take whatever benefit can be obtained from the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Commonwealth, whatever they may be, in relation to the territorial sea and the continental shelf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 6 (e) states:  for facilitating the carrying out by Australia of obligations under, or the exercise by Australia of <span class="highlight">rights</span> under, agreements between Australia and other countries; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We recognise that in this area there will be shipping, fishing and other sorts of <span class="highlight">rights</span> but we want control so that there is no deterioration of the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Opposition feels that to make this legislation completely clear with respect to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of miners, mining companies or exploration companies that may have <span class="highlight">rights</span>, licences or permits within an area of the Australian coastal seas that may be considered for proclamation purposes, an amendment is necessary to this clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After sub-clause 6, insert the following sub-clause: ‘(6a) Any proclamation shall be subject to any <span class="highlight">rights</span>, licences and permits acquired under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967-1973.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is felt that to make the legislation perfectly clear with respect to <span class="highlight">rights</span>, licences and permits that may have been acquired under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967-73 in an area that could be an area to be preserved or proclaimed by the Governor-General for the purposes of establishing a marine national park, an amendment is necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we often squabble about land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, they in many ways could be said to be far more civilised than we are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of this situation, we wanted if possible to find the Aborigines whom other Aborigines would concede have the traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span> to that land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have cast the sub-clauses as widely as we could to ensure that we did not clash with traditional Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly we will have national parks where obviously we will have to observe the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginals to use them in a traditional fashion but, of course, not to destroy the purpose of the park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill will succeed only if due acknowledgment is made of this fact and if the procedures adopted give adequate, legal and automatic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of public participation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no claim, in my opinion, that in any way the Australian Government is usurping State <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this matter, as it is clear that the State governments are also in the initial stages of developing their own techniques. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill includes proposed amendments of the Public Service Act and the Officers’ <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Declaration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Clause 9 relates to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of officers when a department, or part of a department, is abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provision is also made for further appeals to continue to safeguard the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The opportunity has also been taken to include in the Bill certain amendments of the Officers’ <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Declaration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United Nations Charter is based on the principles of dignity and equality inherent in all human beings and the Charter provides that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to promote universal respect for, and observance of, human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, the 25th anniversary of which was celebrated on 10 December 1973, proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and <span class="highlight">rights</span>, that everyone is entitled to all the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms set out in the Declaration, without distinction of any kind, in particular as to race. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the Proclamation of Teheran issued by the International Conference on Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in 1968 observed that the implementation of the principle of non-discrimination, embodied in the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration and other instruments, constituted a most urgent task of mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It further stated that gross denials of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> arising from discrimination on grounds of race outraged the conscience of mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 1972 platform of the Labor Party included the proposal that the Australian Parliament should legislate against all forms of discrimination as part of a program to provide equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> and opportunities for all persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal platform of the Liberal Party, as approved by the Federal Council in October 1974, includes proposals for the implementation and enforcement of legislation to promote equality of <span class="highlight">rights</span> between all Australian citizens and to remove any form of discrimination against Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not believe that any group of Australian citizens should be subject to laws that are inconsistent with fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are intended to remove only elements of this legislation that are inconsistent with what the Australian Government regards as basic civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> to be enjoyed by all Australians, without regard to race or colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key parts of the Bill which were rejected represent a severe setback in the attempt by this Parliament to establish protection of people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point has been properly taken by some of the major national inquiries into health insurance funds in this country that consumers do not have representation on open funds, and accordingly there is a bounden duty incumbent upon a government to ensure the protection of the community’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the operation of those funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is blind opposition of the members of the Liberal and Country Parties in this House and in the Senate, their total commitment to the private health insurance funds and their indifference to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of contributors which has caused them to obstruct the passage of those amendments which would have been so crucial to the effective administration of private health insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1900 no attempt had ever been made to resort to them until 1972 when there was an informal approach by officials from Tasmania and Victoria seeking to know whether there was a possibility of the Government led by  Mr McMahon  joining with Tasmania in petitioning the Queen to refer to the Privy Council for its advisory opinion certain questions relating to <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the seabed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was not a question where governments alone would be concerned because matters concerning <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the seabed so far have come to the High Court for decisiondecisions have been given- not at the instance of the Federal Government or of any State government, but at the instance of private citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Fund could be an excellent mechanism through which foreign investors, interested in investing in Australia but not seeking voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>, could participate in Australian investments without diminishing the degree of Australian control in areas where that might be an important policy consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the wilful misuse of paragraph (b) could mean that the democratic elected <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people of the Northern Territory, in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, could see themselves without any responsibility to make laws for the order and good government of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the clause could be redrawn in a form which would ask but not instruct the Legislative Assembly to reconsider the appropriateness of a Territory law in view of the Commission’s functions and activities and recommend that the Territory consider either repeal or amendment, so as to help the Commission but in no way impinging on the democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have heard much about civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are equally concerned that there is no provision for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that full and proper recognition be given to the status and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a woman as wife and mother; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But life in any society requires a constant balancing of <span class="highlight">rights</span> and interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that this year is International Women’s Year, it is sad to see a Bill before this Parliament which not only takes away <span class="highlight">rights</span> to which every Australian woman has always been entitled but which also imposes upon them new obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from that, of course, we have to consider the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of males. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment claims that full and proper recognition be given to the status and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a woman as wife and mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed I hope that we will all respond because if we do not we are going to stand condemmed and all our talk about human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and quality of life will be just so much useless and meaningless waffle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additionally, clause 6 will enable the holder of an office established by ordinance to be vested with Permanent Head powers under the Public Service Act, whilst clauses 15 to 20 will extend the protections afforded by the Officers’ <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Declaration Act to officers employed under the Public Service Act who become employees of an authority established by ordinance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of officers to be transferred to the statutory corporation are covered by the Officers’ <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Declaration Act, and although this Act does not as it stands fully protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of officers in this situation, the Government plans very soon to amend the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we do not intend to absorb the abovementioned staff into the Corporation until such time as the Officers’ <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Declaration Act has been amended to deal with such a situation in a better way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is asserted in this Convention that aU human beings are born free and equal in dignity and <span class="highlight">rights</span> and that any doctrine of superiority based on racial differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and without any justification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The common law provides few effective remedies against discrimination in the exercise of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, whether it is based on race or colour or on any other grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The BUI Will thus make it unlawful for a person to do an act involving discrimination based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which impairs the enjoyment of fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In Canada, compulsory evidence gathering powers are given to the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> commissions and similar powers are vested in the conciliator established by New Zealand legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill represents an important step in the Government’s program with respect to human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The educative role is at least as significant and the Bill recognises that there must also be effective and systematic enforcement of <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the promotion of education and research, if the elimination of racial discrimination in this country is to be achieved in fact as well as in theory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bill represents one of the most significant attacks ever made upon the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of individuals, parties and bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party is fond of prattling about <span class="highlight">rights</span> guided steadily, it states, by the stern philosophy that there should be a minimum invasion of privacy, yet embodied in this Bill, which seeks to amend the Electoral Act, is a savage, singular and sweeping invasion of privacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such risks will be eliminated; the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australians to express themselves freely at the ballot box, with equal knowledge of all the candidates’ views, will be guaranteed by this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is claptrap and I think it is an infringement of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privacy of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, this legislation is a vicious intrusion into the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual, of the little peoplenot just the big people, not just the multinationals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be very careful that it does not bring down laws that will ultimately work against the principles upon which this society of ours is based- the freedom and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been described as a removal of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of secrecy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the United States of America, whose Constitution enshrines the domocratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual to an extent which is almost beyond belief in a modern society and which is the cause of some problems in that country, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual are totally protected and there is no question that the Supreme Court of the United States would upset any attempt to take away from any individual his <span class="highlight">rights</span> of secret ballot and his <span class="highlight">rights</span> to participate properly in an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take it that if that sort of thing were proposed here it would be said to constitute a denial of the individual’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> and a denial of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to secrecy of the ballot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But apparently this provision is upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States and does not contravene the Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> section of that country’s Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will continue to fight for their <span class="highlight">rights</span> even though regrettably their preferences do not always come my way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person like John Singleton and all his mates can march up to a political party and say: ‘If you want to win this election this is the way to do it: Forget about telling someone for 10 minutes that you have a good policy on a peace zone in the Indian Ocean or that you support equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> for women because that is not the way in which to win votes’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should think that the average Australian would regard it as important to maintain his or her <span class="highlight">rights</span> on the question of political affiliation and on the question of what contributions are made to help a candidate or a party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill represents an infringment of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concept of adultery, the concept of bestiality and all the other grounds are nothing but symptoms, I would suggest, of some malaise that has overtaken a human relationship- a relationship that forms expression in conjugal <span class="highlight">rights</span>- a marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly is not a Bill which has anything to do with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or equality of women in that situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Bill becomes law it will mean that existing <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some members of the House often talk about the preservation of property <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An examination of section 8c of the Acts Interpretation Act will reveal that if an Act of Parliament is repealed the existing <span class="highlight">rights</span> are maintained, but for some reason that will not be the case under this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A man or woman who, at the time this Bill becomes law, has suffered injustice for 10 years, for instance, will, immediately it becomes law, lose any <span class="highlight">rights</span> he or she has at present because he or she has not taken out a petition having been concerned to maintain the marital relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are concerned about preserving human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, yet I believe that we are going to see a direct injustice in this provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Rights</span> are minimised almost necessarily and logically if it is pretended that wrongs or faults do not exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am confident that they will cause the industry to function much more efficiently and with better regard for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of investors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to assure the honourable member that we are not opposing this legislation simply for the purpose of opposing, but rather we are opposing it as the protectors of the people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the preservers of the decision of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It wants to topple the sovereignty and independence of the Senate, the House of State <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One has to admire the Premiers of the free States for their united effort in organising a secretariat in Canberra to protect their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ALP policy is for the abolition of federalism, the Senate and States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> re the Privy Council, Queen’s honours lists and Agents-General, and for the refusal to allow people to decide whether ‘God Save the Queen’ should be the national anthem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party seeks the take-over of the people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we will oppose this legislation, reinforce the arbitrary decision of the Australian people and force the Prime Minister to walk the tight rope of people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is now making his second head-on attack on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Senate to amend, delay or defeat the Government’s legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Sullivan)  who by interjection said that to try to do away with the State’s House, which is the preserver of the democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States and through the States the citizens who live in them, was a most despicable act of the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We submit that it is both unnecessary and unwanted and we ask the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to accept the democratic vote of the Australian people, who told him in no uncertain manner that they do not want a bar of this type of legislation and they will not stand his meddling in the affairs of substance in a way which interferes with their basic <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How does the changing of the date for a Senate election, making it conjoint with the House of Representatives election, deny the Senate any <span class="highlight">rights</span> whatsoever? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Senate will not be affected in any way whatsoever by the carrying of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people- and I do not support States <span class="highlight">rights</span>; I think people are far more important than States- will never be denied by the carrying of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it could be said, and I think quite rightly, that their <span class="highlight">rights</span> are strengthened because on the one day the people of this country will come out and do what the Constitution envisages they will do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you said that they had to hold their elections simultaneously, you would be taking away a measure of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of senators’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To that proposition, I answer- and I say as strongly as I can- that there is something more important than the <span class="highlight">rights</span>  of  senators; there is something more important than the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members of this great House &lt;?f ^preventatives: I refer to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people  of  Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that New Zealand is one of the few countries that has retained appeals to the Privy Council, but even that country would probably reconsider its position if we went ahead and abolished all existing <span class="highlight">rights</span> of appeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That section is the form by which there can be an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, designed with the request and consent of the Australian Parliament to enact legislation, which can specifically change the provisions which are now the ultimate sanctuary of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual in this country- the sanctuary provided by the Australian Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, having said that we believe the time has come when there should be an ultimate acceptance of the High Court by all the governments and parliaments of this country, we do not believe it appropriate for this Government to act, as it has acted in so many other areas, in complete disregard of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Implicit in that compact that was made between the Australian Colonies, as they then were when they federated to form Australia, was the surrender for all time by the 6 colonies of Australia of any claim that they might have to sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the world community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second reason is that the effect may be to implement provisions by regulation that could well affect vested <span class="highlight">rights</span>, such as State interests and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a principle that needs to be understood, that is, that regulations that could arise having far-reaching consequences affecting foreign policy and human <span class="highlight">rights</span> as they might relate to Australia and to the international scene can only be disallowed; they cannot be amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a weak moment, Australia could find itself, in the euphoria of a conference, involved in some international agreement that could well limit the freedom and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of an individual within a community or society, for the sole purpose of trying to preserve the environment as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the situation is that, if the High Court holds that this Parliament did not have the power to pass that legislation, then this Parliament has no authority in terms of sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span>, to quote the Minister’s phrase, over the off-shore area in relation to mining activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Litigation is still going on in both of those countries in respect of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the central government as against the provincial or State governments over off-shore areas that have not yet been explored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So whatever might be the design or desire of the present Government to exercise what it sees to be the sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this Parliament over off-shore areas, there are very good practical reasons why it should approach the exercise of those sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span>, if it is shown by the High Court to have them, in a co-operative way rather than in a destructive way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No company can be sure as to its <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tragedy of the Government’s approach is that in order to extend coverage to all Australians it is taking away the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms of choice of many Australian people and professional groups involved in health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One has only to restate very quickly the principles in the Bill to remind honourable members and the public how unreasonable the Opposition is being- unreasonable in terms of the great responsibility which we assume in this House in Opposition or in Government; unreasonable in its attitude towards the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the expectations of the public, expectations which if they are not at this point developed will become quite apparently developed closer to 1 July when Medibank comes into operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not give a damn about public <span class="highlight">rights</span> and public needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so, however, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members of unions and employer organisations must be fully protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are in fact to be many other changes to the rules that can affect individual members and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual members of a union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again it is an indication of a lack of regard for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual members of a particular organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many members of a trade union would be denied any <span class="highlight">rights</span> at all simply by the apathy of others, simply by a campaign being waged to say ‘Do not return your ballot paper’, or by the ballot papers being intercepted and never reaching the returning officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to stress again the fact that a far more insidious influence is being brought to bear on honourable members opposite, and that is based on one of two things: It could be based on their dedicated belief, such as that held by the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Dr J. F. Cairns),  in an extreme form of socialism, in an extreme form of centralism, in an extreme form of taking away from the individual his <span class="highlight">rights</span> and centralising power in Canberra, appointing bureaucratic boards and appointing people who lack entirely any experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential therefore that the Premier of Queensland be encouraged in his statesman-like approach to preserve the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Queensland beef producers initially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the man who stands in front of the Labor Party and who for years has called for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people in the world to selfdetermination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is nonsense for the Minister for Science to talk about any parallel between the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of government and the roles of government in the Indian acquisition of Goa in the same sentence even as our <span class="highlight">rights</span> and roles with respect to the future of Portuguese Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there is an opportunity for the Australian Government in international forums and certainly in regional forums to ensure that this whole matter is canvassed, that there are discussions not just, as he asserted, in Lisbon, Jakarta, New York and Canberra, but that there are discussions in a public way which will ensure Australia’s long term continued interest in the maintenance of the closest and friendliest relations with Indonesia will be preserved and that the future of Timor is settled in such a way as to ensure the maintenance of peace in this region and to ensure that ultimately the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people of Timor are not denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as I stated in this House on 11 February 1975, I regard the Senate’s rejection of the provisions in the Bill relating to the supervision of health insurance organisations as representing a severe setback in the attempt by this Parliament to establish the protection of people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, there is a bounden duty incumbent upon the Australian Government to ensure the protection of the community’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the operation of those funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For these reasons the Government believes that the General Manager should be a member of the Commission with full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet today the Attorney-General- the parens pater of the country, the man who should stand and speak to defend the views, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the liberties of every subject in this country without fear and without favour- lends the weight of his eminent office and its authority to such a contemptible move as to expect this House of Parliament to deal with this measure in such a short time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>relies too heavily on discretionary powers, rules and regulations and denies effective <span class="highlight">rights</span> of appeal.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any honourable member desires to oppose this Bill on the grounds of States <span class="highlight">rights</span> then I refer that member to the leading article in the ‘Financial Review’ in July last year which suggested that such an argument would be ‘the last refuge of scoundrels’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part of the reason for this Bill is the need to reassure the public that their <span class="highlight">rights</span> are being protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I come now to the other point which has been raised in the media concerning the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those who volunteered during the period referred to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He therefore clearly and consciously abrogated any <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges he could expect as an M.P. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Press evidently sees it as the duty of the Press to inform people of their <span class="highlight">rights</span>, to inform people like  Mr Stonehouse  of the various loopholes that exist in the law that might enable them to make plans to fit in with the loopholes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This can serve only to prejudice the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens outside the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Minister’s actions are beyond reproach, that the Minister has shown himself to be one who has applied the immigration laws with understanding and tolerance, and that above all he has maintained the convention and upheld the law in respect of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members of Parliament of the British Commonwealth of Nations to visit Australia with impunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put to him the view that that is not a good principle, State <span class="highlight">rights</span> or otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has, at the same time, to ensure that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or corporate bodies and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals are properly safeguarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither can we have a simple Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> or Ten Commandments type situation leaving, say, commissioners or judges to fill out the legislation because we would not know what they would do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have our own <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a general comment I think the clause will still as presently drafted create some serious practical difficulties so far as it affects companies’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> and capacities to raise funds on the open market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Companies making a <span class="highlight">rights</span> issue, for example, have to register the prospectus with the Commission as required by this legislation, and the possibility of an extended delay due to the fact that sub-clause (3) requires the Commission to investigate and satisfy itself that the requirements have been comphed with will make it very difficult for companies to pitch the terms of the issue to meet the requirements of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask a question of the AttorneyGeneral as the custodian of our <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the protector of our liberty, the father protector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no ‘compact’ conferring perpetual <span class="highlight">rights</span> on those who have or on those who acquire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is saying one thing when it means another and, consistent with its behaviour in the past, it purports to demonstrate concern for the individual when in fact it has no interest in the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>of the Constitution could shatter the very base of the States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I say to you,  Mr Speaker,  that you should declare forthrightly and show by every action that you take that you do have the courage of the commitment and conviction to principle that this Parliament will function with full recognition of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Opposition and the Government and the obligations of the Opposition and of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Boothby  (Mr McLeay)  believes that the Australian Housing Corporation Bill will be a threat to State <span class="highlight">rights</span>, an intrusion into State affairs and a monster body which will sweep aside State housing bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would remind the Minister that Article  23(1)  of the United Nations Comvention on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, to which Australia is a signatory, reads: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parties to the present Covenant shall take appropriate steps to ensure equality of <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities of spouses as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill, which is to be considered by the Parliament as government legislation,  explicitly recognises the right io many  and found a family, and protects the family against unlawful or arbitrary interference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are, firstly, that full and proper recognition be given to the status and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a woman as wife and mother; secondly, that there should be full and proper protection of the wife and children in the event of the dissolution of a marriage; and, thirdly and lastly, but not least, that there is need for children to be reared and cared for by a present parent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find in this Bill a code which will be common to all States of Australia and which takes pains to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of wives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least one eloquent body on women’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the Women’s Electoral Lobby- an organisation whose members are never slow to find themselves discriminated against- has now stated emphatically that discrimination does not exist in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allegation frequently heard in this chamber, that after this Bill passes women will lose their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to maintenance and will be forced to support themselves, is arrant nonsense and a total misrepresentation of the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, of course, completely within the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all honourable members to take the full 20 minutes which they are allowed to make a speech, but a continuation of the pattern established earlier this morning along those lines would lead to very great difficulty in pursuing the second reading stage of the debate as far as we would like to on this special sitting day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It deals with the family- the duties of a husband and wife to each other, their children and also their property <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill has been denounced as unchristian, a marriage breaker, a nation destroyer, one which neglects the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations of women and men and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and welfare of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the need to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of children and to promote their welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only when we consider the needs of people rather than the legalistic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people, and base those <span class="highlight">rights</span> on needs and contribution, that we can say we are preserving marriage, not as an outmoded institution but as a family unit of welfare which will lead to a better and stronger nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott),  who is at present overseas, is strongly of the view that legislation should never take away established <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against that background, it ought not be forgotten that the law in this field is a social instrument by which <span class="highlight">rights</span> of parties during marriage and upon divorce are established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, when legislation is introduced in the name of social reform, it is proper to ask these questions: What new <span class="highlight">rights</span> are created? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What old <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities does it remove or lessen? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, however, one thing to acknowledge the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and convictions of those described to practise and to recommend, even to urge, others to accept; it is quite another to support amendments which by legislation impose thought systems, theological propositions and religious sanctions which may or may not be relevant in respect to those who seek the resolution of their problems within the protection of the secular law of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sub-clause (c) provides for the need to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of children and to promote their welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under proposed section 1 14, the court may make such an order or grant such an injunction as it thinks proper, including an injunction for the personal protection of a party to the marriage or a child of the marriage; for the protection of the marital relationship; in relation to the property of a party to the marriage, or in relation to the use or occupancy of the matrimonial home; and to make an order relieving a party to a marriage from any obligation to perform marital services or render conjugal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this Bill does not interfere with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of practising Christians- the great majority of our population- nor does it interfere with family life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here again I believe that this Bill does not interfere with their <span class="highlight">rights</span> or views, nor does it engender irresponsibility, a throwing away of values and a destruction of the basis of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legal rules, for instance, governing the property <span class="highlight">rights</span> of husband and wife are quite irrelevant in families where all property has always been pooled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Precisely because children are automatically members of a family and can have no choice in the matter, and be-  …..  they  lIe  subject  try  parental authority their  - ——– j  - - — ~j— j~ ——– ——-  “j : - ~ -  interests must be guaranteed by the state, as it must guarantee the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a member of any association which exercises effective power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some legal systems, a wife’s status is more like that of an object of property <span class="highlight">rights</span> than of a party to a contract. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> of married women against their husbands were considerably extended in this country in the 19th century as part of a general emancipation of women, in custom as well as in law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, a husband is still legally obliged in principle to support his wife, and she has special property <span class="highlight">rights</span> against him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It states that the Family Court, which I concede may need looking at from time to time, shall have regard to the need to protect the institution of marriage and family life generally, the need to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of children and to promote their welfare, and the means available to assist parties to the marriage to consider reconciliation and the improvement of their relationship to each other and to the children of the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat: In my judgment- and this is a matter of judgmentthe equating of 12 months separation with the irretrievable breakdown of marriage is indeed arbitrary and unreal to the point of being unjust, in particular in depriving persons of <span class="highlight">rights</span> now available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the need to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of children and to promote their welfare; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can say much more about the maintenance provisions which, despite what has been said by some people, are entirely fair to women and protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and status of women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the Parliament needs to be convinced that the Bill does not weaken marriage, that it does not destroy the <span class="highlight">rights</span> that attach to individuals -in particular perhaps to a woman who, throughout her life, wants to be nothing more than a wife and mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While obviously not all marriages are permanent or secure, that is the objective to which the law ought to address itself, insofar as it possibly can with fairness to everyone involved - that full and proper recognition be given to the status and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a woman as wife and mother; that there should be full and proper protection of the wife and children in the event of the dissolution of a marriage; that there is need for children to be reared and cared for by a present parent; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the record profit of $70m said to have been made in Queensland this year by Utah Mining Australia Limited, in which we have only 10 per cent Australian equity, I ask the Minister: What are the mining <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Utah Mining Australia Limited in the Queensland Bowen Basin? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Utah Mining Company to mine black coal in the Bowen Basin total 300 million tons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-The honourable member for Henty  (Mrs Child)  seemed to labour the point about the protection of people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> by the introduction of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to be the call of the Government all the time that it is the champion of the people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I see it, if this Government remains in power the people will have no <span class="highlight">rights</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The doctor may ask for the patient’s drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> on the fund and the patient has to agree to transfer them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real position as far as this encroachment on the doctors’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> is concerned is that there are 3 ways in which the scheme will operate: The patient may pay the doctor and receive a refund on receipt; the patient may forward the unpaid account to Medibank and receive a cheque made out to the doctor; or the doctor may directly bill Medibank after accepting assignment of the drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> from the patient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am sick and tired of the honourable member for Henty  (Mrs Child)  using her sanctimonious approach about the people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> and how her socialist Government has a mandate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Medibank can come into operation without this legislation, but the operation of private health insurance would be not only much more messy but also less responsible to the needs and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the House examine the determination relating to the parliamentary First Division officers in the light of its clear responsibility to assert once more the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the independence and something that we have been talking about a great deal- the dignity of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will even be a battle to make clear that it is fundamentally a people’s battle and not just a battle for women’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but a struggle to proclaim that every section of society, all men, women and children born and unborn will benefit from sweeping changes in attitudes to women’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet, on 2 occasions, the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth),  who is sitting in the chamber now, moved motions to interfere with private members’ business day, at the same time talking about what was wanted and what <span class="highlight">rights</span> members should have in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the role of the family has changed quite significantly over the ages and I think that it would be unwise and unreal not to acknowledge this, but if one acknowledges as I do that the family is still the basic unit of society then it also follows that marriage is an essential part of the family relationship because marriage is a public avowal of the relationship between 2 people and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations that they both assume. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that one of its chief weaknesses is that it does not give rise to the maintenance or the development of a public attitude towards the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill gives full regard to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of adults to determine their own relationships as responsible adults, according to ordinary law, provided their actions did not injure or work to the detriment of innocent people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic change in this regard is that the question of maintenance would be determined on a careful assessment of respective needs, responsibilities, resources and earning capacities, without there being a necessity for any argument over <span class="highlight">rights</span> and wrongs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Second, it is proposed that there should be created a comprehensive framework of legal remedies for the enforcement of these <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are going to be able to encourage people to take a different view of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals because all Australian citizens should have equal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However the Opposition will move to amend this legislation because it firmly believes that the Bill in its present form will infringe upon the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual and exacerbate racism in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is significant that the principal architect of this legislation, indeed the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill, is no longer a member of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both Bills seem to give expression to the same obsessions -to break down the long-established system of British common law, to lay down a means of prosecution that will ultimately destroy the professed objectives of the legislation and to use oppressive abuse of power against the fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They mean that persons of a particular race, colour or national or ethnic origin shall enjoy the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> as persons of another race, colour or national or ethnic origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a denial of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit this represents a blatant attack on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals and denies a person privacy to which he ought to be entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe, for the reasons I have stated, that it violates certain human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and fundamental freedoms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition will move amendments in the Committee stage, not designed to condone racism but intended to dismantle what could well become a legisltive monster that would be more suited perhaps to a totalitarian type of dictatorship where the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of the individual are of no consequence but where the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the state are supreme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as there is room in this debate for a view that the best way to tolerance is not necessarily through legislative coercion, it is equally true that there is no room for the view that the essential liberties of people in any society are not necessarily to be protected in the ultimate by the passage of legislation which lays down explicit rules as to what <span class="highlight">rights</span> people have, as to what <span class="highlight">rights</span> people can enjoy and as to what things people can and cannot do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the accepted principles which ensure the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to individual privacy are preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am also concerned about the attitude expressed in paragraphs (d) and (e) of the amendment, namely, that full and proper recognition be given to the status and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a woman as a wife and mother and that there should be full and proper protection of the wife and children in the event of the dissolution of a marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 43 deals with family provisions, the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage, the need to give the widest possible protection and asistance to the family, the need to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of children and the means available for assisting parties to the marriage to consider reconciliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can find nothing in the Bill to suggest that wives left by their husbands will be deprived of <span class="highlight">rights</span> that they now have regarding maintenance and custody of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that full and proper recognition be given to the status and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a woman as wife and mother; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe there should be some reform regarding divorce but I also  most  firmly believe that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of children and marriage, if we are to continue living under our present socio-economic structure, must be protected and after perusal and deliberation I have reached the conclusion that this Bill will only undermine our society, irrespective of one ‘s religious persuasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are persons who will disregard entirely the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of their children and if it is the husband who is at fault, I would venture the view that the wife is well rid of the wretch and the sooner she can get separated from him the better and any talk of limiting the separation period before a divorce may be obtained to 12 months or 12 days is really superficial comment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is curious that in the House of Representatives, where there is only one woman member, it falls to the lot of most male members of the House to protect women’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> against the wishes of many women’s organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a person can say of anyone, ‘I heard him call someone a so and so Kraut’ or whatever might be insulting to some other person, if it is reported to the Commissioner and proceedings are instituted, the person who is accused has no <span class="highlight">rights</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If members of the Government feel that Opposition speakers in this debate have railed against some of the more unsatisfactory aspects of the Bill, it is because it appears to the Opposition that there has been an indifference on the part of the Government in drafting the provisions of this legislation to take account of some of the fundamental things, when one is dealing with civil liberties and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual, which have been known to our law for many centuries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a person appointed as Commissioner or as an officer of the Commissioner was, immediately before his appointment, an officer of the Australian Public Service or a person to whom the Officers’ <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Declaration Act 1928-1973 applied- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>he retains his existing and accruing <span class="highlight">rights</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for the purpose of determining those <span class="highlight">rights</span>, his service as Commissioner or as an officer shall be taken into account as if it were service in the Australian Public Service; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Officers’ <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Declaration Act 1928-1973 applies as if this Act and this section had been specified in the Schedule to that Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provided, however, that such measures do not, as a consequence, lead to the maintenance of separate <span class="highlight">rights</span> for different racial groups and that they shall not be continued after the objectives for which they were taken have been achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here again there would be no difference between the Government and, I think, the Oppositioncertainly myself- in relation to the intention, but I am worried as to the interpretation that might be placed on this proviso in a court of law if it had to take it into account in relation to an appeal under clause 10 of the Bill by a person of a non-Aboriginal race who was claiming the special <span class="highlight">rights</span> that are given to the people of the Aboriginal race under legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this to those gentlemen who talk about a democratic society: Ask the oppressed peoples who sometimes have to survive in a democratic society; ask the Aborigines about a democratic society; ask those who are getting angry at being denied their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ask you to support us in every way to make sure we retain our <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Cease being an agent of Petersen and fight for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedom of your people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The chief feature of that Bill, as honourable members will recall, and its pertinence to the matter now being discussed is that by the introduction of penalties we will be able to achieve what understanding and reason have not been able to achieve previously, notwithstanding that the resolution, as evidenced in the Schedule attached to the Racial Discrimination Bill, insists that we are to promote and encourage universal respect for and observance of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and fundamental freedoms for all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There seems to be as much neglect in educating people to their responsibilities as there is enthusiasm for advancing their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to privileges, real or imaginary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to decide whether we want to maintain the culture of the Aboriginal, whether we want to grant land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to him, whether we want to relegate him to the distant places of this continent or whether we want to absorb or merge- describe it as we please- him into the main Australian community, realising that that represents about 99 per cent of our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it had been made in 1775, just a year before the Declaration of Independence and other things that flowed from that, including the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of man and so on, it might well have been in tune. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should think that it is the first real attempt by any Australian government to make sure that all its citizens get equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> wherever they are, despite the intervention of any State government, reactionary as some of the State governments may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not going to tolerate the intervention between ourselves and the citizens of this country of any State government or any other authority where the fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those citizens are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Governments do not have <span class="highlight">rights</span>; they have duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other issues are important, including the handling of the railways, transport, urban development and the rest of them, but when it gets down to the fundamental principle of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens that is where the thing begins and that is what this legislation is about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there any honourable member who thinks that governments ought to be able to intervene between a person and his property <span class="highlight">rights</span> just by saying: ‘We need to deal with you that way’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are facing and dealing with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people who before the great panoply of government are helpless, and who before the pressures of the competitive society to which my colleague the honourable member for Wide Bay referred are helpless in many respects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment the principal concern is the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of access to government benefits that flow from being resident in the Torres Strait islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point has never been put to these people that there are alternative forms of legislation which would give them land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, which would give them title to their own reserves and which would enable them to determine their own destiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government very shortly will introduce legislation to give land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Aborigines in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates to their determination with respect to <span class="highlight">rights</span> of entry and with respect to who shall reside on the reserves in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When looking at the arguments put forward by the honourable member for Gwydir the first point to be considered is that we are dealing with an Act of the Queensland Parliament which is in force, so anything that is done concerning the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines to enter on to reserves is done under the authority of that Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be clearly understood by honourable members that the clauses which were removed by the Senate and which are the subject of the amendment now before us are there to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all Aborigines and all Islanders to enter upon and live peaceably on those places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should vest the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> of these reserves in a meaningful way in the Aboriginal people who live there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I want to place on record the fact that I think selfdetermination does not include <span class="highlight">rights</span> over other people in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the fact is that there are opportunities for infringement of ordinary; fundamental human <span class="highlight">rights</span> implied in the present situation and in the points that have been put by some of the members opposite who have spoken in the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From this we should have with proper safeguards for the general public an arrangement whereby individuals will have access to their files and perhaps advocates operating on behalf of individuals may also have access to files with the authority of clients so that there may be maximum guarantee of individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> so far as my Department is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even when challenged in the House about his associations with  Mr Butler’s  League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> the honourable member avoided dissociating himself from the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1940s I paid annual subscriptions to the ‘New Times’ publication, a publication produced by the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These publications were mostly used by the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> at that time to expose communist subversion in the Western world, including Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never attended any League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> meetings or activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make it clear now that I neither support the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> and its extremist views nor the Communist Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the record I once again dissociate myself completely from the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> and its founder,  Mr Eric  Butler, whom I have never met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I have fought at least one campaign against the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, in 1972 in my own electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have probably done more in that particular area to fight the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> than any other member of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of his address, the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  dealt with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members and the need for private members to be given the opportunity to participate in an effective way in the work of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today, we find the Leader of the Opposition taking away the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members and then saying in the course of bis speech that private members ought to be given more time for speeches in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My responsibility as the Leader of this House is to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all private members, Government and Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said so, in accordance with the policy of this Government of maintaining the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members, I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that he might debate this subject at a more appropriate time, and I move: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That principle was embodied in a very famous speech by Edmund Burke to the electors of Bristol when he pointed out to them what has become and what has been referred to by many scholars and political scientists as a classic assertion of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of an individual member of Parliament to do what his conscience dictates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed to single out the spouse in this way surely must be offensive to those who are taking an interest in such matters as International Women’s Year and in the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of women and their position in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, this clause does no more than guarantee to a political party that it shall have the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> to its name as a partnership, a trust, a firm or a company once it registers its name under appropriate legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must accept that there can be no restriction on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people to group together, to form parties and, having formed parties, to offer candidates for election by the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He ought to be trying to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But some clauses of the proposed legislation, while they may be superficially attractive, will have the ultimate effect of denying voters their basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> and heavily disadvantage minor parties and independent candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is quite disgraceful to suggest removing <span class="highlight">rights</span> such as postal voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposals which the present Opposition made in March 1971 and which this Government made last November included provisions for improving voting facilities for patients and inmates of hospitals, convalescent homes and institutions, franchise <span class="highlight">rights</span> for representatives of a government or public authority who are posted overseas, and the prohibition of members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly being elected to the Australian Parliament while still members of that Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The change involves no derogation from voters’ democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span>; in fact, it will enhance them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is the philosophy behind this clause and this Bill, as I said you are fiddling with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Australian people and that is absolutely unjust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all we have a compulsory system of voting which surely means that the Government and, indeed, the Parliament should be providing for conditions that make it reasonably easy for people either to vote under compulsion or to exert their <span class="highlight">rights</span> as they happen to see the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will permit those intentions to be translated even further into action and it will be yet another example, and a major one at that, of the recognition by this Government of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of women in Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Secondary students are not being taught their <span class="highlight">rights</span> under hire purchase agreements; how to buy a house; how to complete a tax return or what to claim as deductions; what <span class="highlight">rights</span> they have if they are arrested by the police; the pros and cons of health insurance and life insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>People have asked, very surprisingly, about the taxation <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this body and complained about exemption from taxation as if it were some greatly significant body in competition with commercial publishers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a procedure which would open the way to all other sorts of interest groups demanding that their <span class="highlight">rights</span> for representation should also be written into the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me-1 am sure I will be excused for feeling thisthat members of the Opposition have their usual hang-ups about State <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have no wonder that the right honourable member for Higgins,  Mr Gorton,  is still writing articles about how his Party is going wrong in this sphere of action, as is being exemplified by what is being done by the Australian Labor Government as opposed, I repeat, to the nitpicking that is going on about State <span class="highlight">rights</span> on the other side of the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to take it upon myself to express a view as to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or liabilities of members of Parliament or candidates for Parliament who happen to be barristers, solicitors, chemists or doctors, all of whom in one way or another can receive payments for professional services to various federal agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Equally, the Opposition accepts that the Statistician, with his tremendous responsibilities and <span class="highlight">rights</span>, takes on a statutory position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also provides that he will have roughly the same set of responsibilities and <span class="highlight">rights</span> within Australia as the Commissioner of Taxation has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what the Opposition is concerned about, and I am sure that subsequent speakers in the debate will stress the very real concern of the Opposition about this matter of privacy, bearing in mind the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual when looking at some of the suggested programs in almost all aspects of life that are recommended in the Crisp report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it sets out the function of the Bureau and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations of the Statistician. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals in this country, a democracy, are important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will always be demands by Government, by individual groups, by organisations for information which, in one view, should be available and which, in another view, to ask for it would be an invasion of personal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regretfully, under both Liberal and Labor Governments, we have seen an expansion into the privacy of the individual- an erosion of the individual’s liberty and <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Generally, the public is becoming increasingly aware of its <span class="highlight">rights</span> and remedies under the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The legislation promised a dramatic change in consumer <span class="highlight">rights</span> and a dismantling of agreements and conduct in restraint of trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the honourable member for Bennelong  (Mr Howard)  who touched on the question of State <span class="highlight">rights</span> in a kind of State <span class="highlight">rights</span>-centralist context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other matter that I should like to add is that, notwithstanding that there is genuine confusion in some areas of consumer protection and a need to clear it up- I do not think it can be pushed aside by some references to State <span class="highlight">rights</span> versus centralism- the Opposition believes quite strongly that an area in which the Government indisputably has a direct interest and ought to have a direct involvement is the laying down and enforcement of product safety and information standards and the labelling and packaging of goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is called a States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> or a centralist argument, so be it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> to export the minerals have been given and so an inquiry is now to be held, I suppose, in the hope that the minimum amount of damage is done to the environment, to the sand dunes and the island in the course of those mining operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we came to office we were faced with a situation created by the Government of Queensland, a Country Party Government which has ruled Queensland for many years and which has granted leases and mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span> according to its own legislation and is now in the process virtually of being criticised by its own Country Party members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1972, having had <span class="highlight">rights</span> there before and carrying on quite an amount of exploration work, they took advantage of legislation introduced by the Queensland Country Party Government to obtain leases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Being faced with an application from these people, knowing their long standing <span class="highlight">rights</span> and knowing the relatively stringent conditions which the Queensland Government was imposing I was faced with the situation as to what I ought reasonably and fairly to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interstate commission they envisaged was modelled largely on the commission created in the United Kingdom by the Railway and Canal Traffic Act of 1888, which was designed to prevent unjust charges and ensure <span class="highlight">rights</span> of through traffic amongst private railway systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750421_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can be excused for advancing the argument that this Commission is another 2-pronged attack on the constitutional <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States and private enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750421_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As an Opposition we will not be recreant to the trust that has been placed in us; we will wear proudly the mantle of protection of people ‘s <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750421_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose for which it was established and for which it has had a continuing charter for many years was to bring an organised approach to the marketing, supply and handling of the Australian wheat crop whilst protecting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Australian consuming public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750421_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are happy to give to the fourth arm of government power to introduce through legislative and arbitrative processes decisions which affect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of every individual in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750421_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The freight rate can be loaded in those operations and then the Commission has no <span class="highlight">rights</span> of investigation, no power under the amendment proposed by the Opposition to issue any direction as to unfair and unreasonable competition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750421_reps_29_hor94/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, in answer to the argument that the States should perform these duties or that it is a deprivation of States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the Grants Commission to perform these duties, it needs to be remembered also that State Ministers have the right to approach the Grants Commission- their approaches are welcomed by the Commission- in respect of any submission or application that has been made by a local government unit in their State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We hope, despite the opposition that has been indicated by the Opposition, that the provisions of this Bill which state the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Parliament in the control of monopolies that are handed over to private groups will be exercised in the interests of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government Insurance Office will be an approved authority for the purpose of the Superannuation Act, and the Officers’ <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Declaration Act will apply to those members of the staff of the office who formerly held office under other statutes or within the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This situation creates difficulties in that an employee, a shop steward, a junior trade union official and even a senior trade union official have to look at 2 sets of statutes, State and national, in order to ascertain the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations of the union and its members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Anybody looking at the provisions of section 5 1 of the Constitution will see that it is contemplated that the Australian Government will establish an Australian Government bank and an Australian Government insurance office, because the Constitution safeguards the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of State government banks and State government insurance offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We on this side of the House believe that the socialistic approach of the present Government to all aspects of the way of life of the citizens of this country violates the fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> and desires of Australians right into the very front door of their home, as this legislation shows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That report argued quite clearly that if a proper balance is achieved between the administrative efficiency and the need to provide for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual, an effective review process, so far from leading to inefficiency, will in fact increase efficiency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not in any sense an indictment of the performance of the Public Service or any indictment of its essential integrity, rather it is a recognition of the overwhelming need to achieve a balance between administrative efficiency and the protection of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a member of a Party that talks about State <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the honourable member completely ignored the activities that have been carried out by individual Australian States in this area of reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our present way of life our community planning, the developing interrelationships between individuals and between the individual and public bodies, the standards we enjoy could not have been achieved without giving powers to certain public bodies or to have certain controls and <span class="highlight">rights</span> to protect the community but which of necessity affect individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People have come to accept that in certain circumstances their private <span class="highlight">rights</span> may have to be subordinated to the claims of the community at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, it is important to ensure that a citizen who believes his <span class="highlight">rights</span> have been unduly infringed has the opportunity to have his grievance considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been properly pointed out that there is a substantial body of government programs which provide <span class="highlight">rights</span> and benefits both to organisations and to individuals which do not arise with the backing of specific legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only regret, however, that there are still some who have not understood or openly supported a proper system of administrative review, of which this Bill forms part; for there can be no doubt that in a rapidly increasing Public Service the occasion for ignorance, delay, injustice, inefficiency and lack of humanity to trample upon the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of our people must with certainty increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the meantime we have heard much about an abortive Bill for human <span class="highlight">rights</span> but the establishment of basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the citizen in his dealing with bureaucracy have been neglected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The regulations had to be consistent with the powers conferred on the statutory body and at all times the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals had to be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that a review of the exercise of administrative discretions by public servants is in the public interest and in the interests of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Benefits have been gradually improved and in recent years provision has been made for the preservation of superannuation <span class="highlight">rights</span> on entry into or exit from the scheme and noncontributory units have been introduced to give some relief to members faced with very nigh contributions in their later years of service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is clear that they have been directed to campaign against this Government, which is a serious denial of civil <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of the total amount, that well known company and protector of the people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the Australian Mutual Provident Society, receives an annual rental from the Government of $5,189,000; the National Mutual Life  Association of  Australasia Ltd receives $2,503,000; and the Mutual Life and Citizens’ Assurance Co.

    <p>To sum up, these great protectors of the people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> are doing pretty well out of a socialist government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are in the course of redefining the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations attaching to the most personal and fundamental relationship that can exist between 2 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is a serious intrusion on people’s fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Even though these people may be few, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the few are as important as the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the many. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the proposition is put around this country that a quick divorce will no longer be available under the proposals of this Bill and that those who are otherwise the innocent parties will be condemned to serve out time, it is appropriate for this Parliament to say: ‘We will intervene in that situation and preserve the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of what may be an innocent party’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was pointed out in the second reading speech that when alterations are made to most Acts of Parliament existing <span class="highlight">rights</span> are maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately there are certain circumstances, though not in the majority of cases, where immediate divorce is desirable and almost necessary to safeguard the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or even the lives of people concerned, if you like to take it to that extreme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Surely it is reasonable that people who are entering the institution of marriage must have some respect for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the other party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But its intent is to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the party who is not agreeable to a divorce and who may quite reasonably believe that the passage of time could bring about a reconciliation of the parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought not to forget that what the Family Law Act will do, as the Matrimonial Causes Act which the Bill intends to replace already does, is establish the legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> of parties to a marriage upon the dissolution of that marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The law must also establish the grounds upon which those new legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> are to be created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think particularly of the innocent husband or wife who, at the whim of the other spouse, finds that the marriage is put at an end and, at the whim of that other spouse, the innocent party’s legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> can be broken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is said that that person’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> are protected by other provisions of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I feel has happened amongst the protagonists for the provision for 12 months separation is that in their pursuit of the admirable goals of simplicity and cheapness of removing wrangling and legal complexity from divorce they have denied to persons what ought to be regarded as some of their fundamental personal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot think of anything more illiberal than to deny to that innocent person the right to go to law to dissolve the marriage and to re-establish his or her legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> under the provisions of the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Kevin Cairns) spoke, I believe, very eloquently about the need of this Parliament to preserve the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the innocent party in any marriage dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am afraid that this gets back to a States <span class="highlight">rights</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>State <span class="highlight">rights</span> position; but the reality surely is, as was put by the honourable member for Deakin, the honourable member for Griffith and the honourable member for Angas  (Mr Giles)  on the Opposition side, that much needs to be done to improve the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who are supporters of States <span class="highlight">rights</span>, like the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen),  forget in their hysteria clause 41, which requires the government of the day to try to reach agreement with the States to have the States set up their family courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This amendment was moved because I felt that the maintenance procedures should be limited to protecting a party’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> and should not be brought just for the purpose of protecting a party’s point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It refers to ‘the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage’, ‘the need to give the widest possible protection and assistance to the family as the natural and fundamental group unit of society’, the responsibility for the care and education of dependent children, ‘the need to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of children and to promote their welfare’, and ‘the means available for assisting parties to a marriage to consider reconciliation or the improvement of their relationship to each other and to the children of the marriage ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The prime reason for incest prohibition seems to be the necessity for preventing society from becoming snarled in its own web: every person has a complex set of duties, <span class="highlight">rights</span>, obligations, and statuses with regard to other people, and these would become intolerably complicated or even contradictory if incest were freely permitted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I rather hope that the majority of members of this Parliament are prepared to vote in favour of this amendment to ensure, if in fact there is some doubt about it, as I believe there is, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the protection of women under this new Family Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Far too often we have seen parties enter into agreements in respect of matters such as custody and particularly in respect of matters concerning maintenance and the disposition of property and, when the agreements have been put under finer examination by someone who is able to determine more accurately and precisely what sort of settlement should be made, we have found that people have signed away their <span class="highlight">rights</span> without any real understanding of what they have done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point is that clause 114 is directed and devised in order to protect particular types of people from action which can be embarrassing to them or which can be considered as infringing their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These comprise company takeovers effected by means of acquisitions of shares other than voting shares; company takeovers effected by means of splitting a large shareholding into small nominee groups where this has the effect of increasing the voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> attached to the shareholding; business takeovers effected by means of leases or licences over the assets of a business; and business takeovers effected by agreements and arrangements relating to board representation <span class="highlight">rights</span> and <span class="highlight">rights</span> to participate in the management or profits of a business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whenever progressive policies are projected by the Government in this House to give effect to the mandate that was obtained from the people in 1972 and 1974, the scream of ‘socialism ‘is heard in practically every speech from Opposition members, who are devoid of any objective argument and dedicated to carrying out the philosophy of organisations such as the National Civic Council, the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, the White Australia Committee and other sectional interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not prepared to accept the amendment for the simple reason that what is not required, particularly in dealing with matters of this nature which require compassion, understanding and a certain amount of flexibility, is putting down in legal terms what will be the strict limitations of a person’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have yet to hear the proposed time schedule, but if the Minister follows his past pattern, his mania for cutting off adequacy of opportunity for debate is such that I guess we will have about half an hour to pass 5 major Bills affecting the electoral <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I look upon it perhaps as a second home in some ways, but I am sure that the great majority of the people in New South Wales would agree with me that it is not only their more populous numbers which are to be considered in these matters which affect the whole country but the minorities have some <span class="highlight">rights</span> under our Constitution since it was based on the principle that smaller States and indeed other States would have a say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the claims of opponents of the Aus.tralian Government about the infringement of State <span class="highlight">rights</span> by this Government, this legislation is a shining example of the co-operation and coordination between the 3 levels of government in our nation that can develop and that do exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, what should be of grave concern to this Parliament and to anybody interested in Tasmania’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> are the reasons that have apparently caused the Upper House to request the Government of Tasmania to obtain further assurances from the Australian Government in relation to the Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I conclude on this point: The waterside workers have won their position and should guard it jealously but they should not sacrifice the standards and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of others to opportunities simply for unjustified pursuits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I venture to say that if this were done the efficiency of the corporation, properly managed in the way that I am suggesting, would be such that even though it had only <span class="highlight">rights</span> to competition in intrastate shipping it would very soon assume virtually what amounts to full <span class="highlight">rights</span> to take intrastate as well, because I cannot imagine how many of the stevedoring companies in the main ports could continue to operate if all they were allowed to do was to deal with intrastate shipping. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But what the Opposition seeks in this amendment is an important principle: There should be some statutory recognition of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members so far as the drafting of instruments and amendments in the Parliament are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the interpretation which has been given to judicial power since the early 1920s, the fact is that the High Court has restricted its judgments to matters, that is, to matters involving the decision about <span class="highlight">rights</span>, duties, liabilities or the obligations of the parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Should we not now put the interests of all Australians ahead of State <span class="highlight">rights</span> and Party considerations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think we all should realise that this is part of an evolutionary process which will show up some of the defects, or what appear to be defects, in the ability of the ordinary individual in the community to obtain his proper <span class="highlight">rights</span> or at least to have his <span class="highlight">rights</span> and role examined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Quite some time ago I remember that I asked the Minister before he was AttorneyGeneral and when he was the Minister in this place representing the Attorney-General, one or two questions about this matter, and from the replies that he gave me at that time it was quite obvious to me that the Minister, who of course is now the Attorney-General, was genuinely interested in the appointment of an Australian ombudsman to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sincerely trust that the appointment of an Australian ombudsman and the 2  deputy  ombudsmen and the establishment of an Australian Appeals Tribunal will ensure not only that justice is done and is seen to be done but also that what has been described as the delicate path between the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual citizens and harmony in the machinery of government will be clearly and effectively protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that it is important that the Ombudsman should not be hamstrung in his appointed task of redressing grievances and protecting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the ordinary citizen against bureaucratic processes or decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think more and more that the task we will face in government is somehow or other to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual in a society where the ordinary people- the little people if I could use that phrase- tend to become submerged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the smaller people, people with very specific problems such as the migrants are submerged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course there are some people in this situation who can really act with less than proper concern for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people to whom their administration is directed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am simply concerned at the concept of bigness, at the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual, and that we need to be constantly on our guard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill has to do with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Territorians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other question posed at that referendum concerned the voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of the Northern Territory, who were probably more concerned with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines than were people in any other community in Australia, were denied the right to vote at that referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of restricting the Bill and the subsequent referendum questions to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people in the Territories to vote at referenda, the Government added a third question which had heavy implications which the people of the States just could not possibly accept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that it is not interested in giving and has really made no effort to give Territorians their full <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is why I am bringing to the attention of the House the fact that people of the Northern Territory are being denied their <span class="highlight">rights</span> in respect of voting at referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I urge the Government to consider this Bill and listen to the cries of the people from the Northern Territory to have the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> as people in the rest of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In case there be any doubt I suggest that one of our efforts in the law of the sea discussions should be to achieve a situation where coastal States have either a right or an obligation to preserve the marine environment around their shores, not unrealistically and not without regard to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of fishermen, traditional or otherwise, but having regard to the fact that it is part of the heritage of Australia and indeed of the world beyond. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill reflects the Government’s expectation not only that the Office will provide legal aid in significant cases affecting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people in need but that it will also contribute to community awareness on matters of <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations, community education and assist the process of law reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a later stage other areas of national significance such as Ayers Rock/Mount Olga National Park and Coburg and Tanami Desert Wildlife Sanctuaries may also be vested in the Director, or managed under an appropriate agreement with the Aboriginal people in accordance with Section 18 of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, as the case may be, dependent upon further consideration of, and action to implement, the recommendations of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-85-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The result is that there is now agreement that the events which led to the ministerial changes have been properly responded to, but I do not believe that the House can easily press on to other issues without fairly acknowledging the valuable and honourable role of the honourable member for Lalor to this institution over many years and his honourable and unyielding commitment to the issues of personal <span class="highlight">rights</span>, civil liberties and the freedoms of a democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-139-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main argument against retrospectivity is that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of third parties could be adversely affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a consequence third party <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should not as representatives of major political parties- let alone as representatives of the largest political party in this country- squeeze out the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals to stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What about his personal <span class="highlight">rights</span> as a citizen? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While his dedication to the protection of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the citizen and the attainment by eligible persons of their entitlements under the law must be indubitable, he can be no policy maker or social reformer in his own cast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In essence the Bill before the House seeks to cover not only transactions in shares but also transactions in assets, including mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, takeovers covered by the 1972 policy measures, that is, takeovers of businesses by means of asset acquisitions and takeovers of mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These comprise company takeovers effected by means of acquisitions of shares other than voting shares; company takeovers effected by means of splitting a large shareholding into small nominee groups where this has the effect of increasing the voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> attached to the shareholding; business takeovers effected by means of leases or licences over the assets of a business; and business takeovers effected by agreements and arrangements relating to broad representation <span class="highlight">rights</span> and <span class="highlight">rights</span> to participate in the management or profits of a business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can look at the questions of mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the takeover of assets of a company and other things like splitting shareholdings so that a large shareholding group split into a number of smaller groups has greater voting power than perhaps one group would have; business takeovers by means of leases or licences over the assets of a business; the arrangements of boards and the commercial bigamy of boards which can be used to usurp powers of a company from a distance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the proposed takeover is judged not to be against the national interest on this basis, the following additional criteria will also be taken into account: Whether, after the takeover, the business concerned could be expected to follow practices consistent with Australia’s interest in matters such as exports, imports, local processing of materials produced, research and development and industrial relations; and whether the takeover would be consistent with the Government’s objectives in relation to such matters as defence, the environment and conservation, urban and regional development and the preservation of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did not affect incorporated or unincorporated businesses by way of acquisitions of assets and mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, administrative practices were introduced to maintain some control over incorporated or unincorporated businesses by means of acquisitions of assets and mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These comprise company takeovers effected by means of acquisitions of shares other than voting shares; company takeovers effected by means of splitting a large shareholding into small nominee groups where this has the effect of increasing the voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> attached to the shareholding; business takeovers effected by means of leases or licences over the assets of a business; and business takeovers effected by agreements and arrangements relating to board representation <span class="highlight">rights</span> and <span class="highlight">rights</span> to participate in the management or profits of a business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example- I quoted this case when the legislation was last being extended in this House- Industrial Equity announced in May 1974 that it had restructured its issued shares by restricting the voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> of overseas shareholders and large bundles of shares were placed in the hands of the staff superannuation fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition an examinable proposal under the legislation includes the acquisition of voting or non-voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> in a corporation which has considered total assets greater than $3m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since foreign takeover controls were first introduced in 1972 they have operated on the following basis: Firstly, the interim legislationthe Companies (Foreign Take-Overs) Act 1972-1974- extends to foreign takeovers of companies effected by means of acquisitions of voting shares; and secondly, the policy measures taken in December 1974 when the Government announced its comprehensive foreign takeover legislation proposals, extended to takeovers of incorporated or unincorporated business by means of acquisitions of assets, and mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, the likely effect of the new proposals will be, firstly, takeovers of businesses by means of asset acquisitions and takeovers of mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed that the criteria for determining national interest be widened to take into account all competition, productive capacity, development of new markets, conservation, urban development and the preservation of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether the takeover would be consistent with the Government’s objectives for defence, the environment and conservation, urban and regional development or the preservation of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Turning now to the publication of an alleged statement by the Leader of the House- a statement which the Leader describes as false- I think the House would agree that such wilful publication is damaging to the integrity of the person concerned and constitutes a serious infringement of his <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To my mind in the final analysis politics is about people and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government went to the people, one of the objectives of its policy was to establish a bill of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> to be applied throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On page 45 of the Platform Constitution and Rules of the Australian Labor Party, we see that the Australian Constitution is to be amended to provide for the protection of fundamental civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian and State Parliaments to pass Acts providing for human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and civil liberties, and to take all possible legislative and administrative action and judicial proceedings to prevent infringement of such <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties and in particular to prevent discrimination on the grounds of colour, race, sex, creed or politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are faced today with a blatant attempt by -this Government to eat away at the fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to suggest that people who have been allowed to come to this land, who have lost so much, their possessions, their <span class="highlight">rights</span> in their own country and above all some of their self respect, should now be permitted to enter Australia as second class citizens and be denied the inalienable <span class="highlight">rights</span> which we all take for granted, is a situation which I for one view with abhorrence and dismay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to make it quite clear at this point that, whether a person is a Chilean, a Bait, a Ugandan, a Cypriot or a Vietnamese, once given permission to enter Australia they should have the full <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities under the law of this land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, it is essential that people who live in Australia be given the full <span class="highlight">rights</span> under the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I submit that the Government, by this action, has contravened Articles 14 and 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly there is no law of which I am aware which dictates that any person or any citizen living in this land should be prevented from enjoying to the full his democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With the great earnestness that our Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor)  may have to carry out such an exercise- I am pleased that he is sitting in the chamber tonight- there would be no possibility of his doing so because of the proprietary <span class="highlight">rights</span> which are Victoria’s over the La Trobe Valley coal, and I think that the Minister might agree with me on that point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I see it not only has the pharmacist in community practice not been paid his just <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the past 3 years but now, because the entitlement is being paid- or more correctly 2 years of it is being paid in the tax year- the Government will reap back a substantial amount of the payments in extra taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So far as can be ascertained from the elections, public opinion polls, political meetings, letters from constituents and letters to editors of newspapers, the majority of Australians want the Government to create the overall economic conditions which will enable them to use their education and talents to live their lives with as much choice as the network of <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations in the community will allow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The vast majority of Australians are unaware of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges under the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the aim of the Australian legal aid program to make people aware of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and to place them on an equal footing with the more affluent members of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, trade practices legislation is designed to create a free market place situation where the consumer does have some <span class="highlight">rights</span>, where the consumer is presented with some choice, where competition does work or at least is encouraged to work so as to provide some of the beneficial aspects of a competitive system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was left to my Government to ratify the 1953 Convention on the Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span> of Women, the 1951 International Labour Organisation Equal Remuneration Convention and the 1958 Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was the Australian representative,  Mr Brennan,  correct in reflecting the views of his Government when he said that Australia was of the view that the person seeking protection derived his <span class="highlight">rights</span> merely from his quality as a person in need of protection and from nothing else?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As it was further made clear that this proposed convention was seeking to apply the same principles as followed in connection with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of territorial asylum and the convention on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of refugees, I ask the Prime Minister: Because of the need to at least appear to be truthful to the rest of the world will he withdraw the quite un-Australian shackles that he has placed on a number of Vietnamese refugees which still prevent them from pursuing in this country their full political <span class="highlight">rights</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was a time in this country when every citizen, even the humble sausage maker and candle-stick maker, had 2 fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span>- to own his own home and to have a job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But these <span class="highlight">rights</span> and their associated hopes have been splintered through the schemes and policies of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People and governments- State and Federal- irrespective of their position, progressively are challenging the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of large corporations in this country to control and manipulate resources on which the people’s standard of living depends and to which our economy is both extremely sensitive and vulnerable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and wishes of the island people involved, a strong objection to the proposal was that Australia would lose control of the great north-east channel which connects the Indian and Pacific Oceans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In clause 8 of the Bill we should remove all the references to the acquisition of proprietary <span class="highlight">rights</span> in goods, of ownership, and let the Corporation be fully confident to act as agent for principals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Federal Conference of the Labor Party in its industrial relations policy placed human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and values first and provided for the development of full human dignity in the industrial sphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our policies strive to encourage, protect and respect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities of all those engaged in industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that he should look at what are the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of government to intervene in industrial disputes, where government is restricted and how rigidly it is restricted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some criticisms of this clause are that it comes dangeroulsy close to the situation where those who would object might seek to obtain, to have and to keep monopoly <span class="highlight">rights</span> into and out of a particular market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I then went on to discuss a number of myths about the Senate, the suggestion for example that it really is distinctively useful as a House of review; that it can realistically be looked to for protection of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States; that a multiparty rather than a 2-party Senate is desirable in principle despite the minority balance of power situations to which it lends itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the founding fathers drew up our Constitution they balanced the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the colonies, which were later to become the States, with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the population of Australia as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, because of the expressed <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the colonies at the time and because they felt there was a need to have a States House, which after federation rapidly became a Party House, the situation developed- and it exists at the present time- where the Senate in certain circumstances could refuse Supply and thus force the House of Representatives to an election without having to go to an election itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They give no consideration to the justice of their claims to certain <span class="highlight">rights</span> and certain conditions to which they are entitled by reason of the positions they occupy or to the lead they should give the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague the present Minister for Repatriation and Compensation  (Senator Wheeldon)  has taken up the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of and our duties and obligations to the servicemen with a vigour which certainly transcends that of his predecessors on the other side of the fence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of his recent promises, will the Minister inform the House when the Government proposes to introduce the Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are concerned to see that they get all the <span class="highlight">rights</span> that should accrue to them as members of the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, perhaps the Government has thought that land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the settlement of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in itself would largely solve the Aboriginal problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt the prospects of their gaining <span class="highlight">rights</span> over their own tribal land which is being facilitated by the Government could have some bearing on these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are all kinds of <span class="highlight">rights</span> that have to be acknowledged in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, by causing this delay, has not only unilaterally and surreptitiously cut the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all past servicemen who have not yet used their entitlement for home assistance, but it has also breached the contract to which it was party with enlisted servicemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a system which guarantees political freedom and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual by decentralised power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister also shows a concern, which is unique in this hurley burley of mining and so on, for the interests of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have talked of things such as fundamental equality, which has resulted in equal pay and in liquor <span class="highlight">rights</span>, things which have had some benefits and some costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were the ones who neglected the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of tenants for a quarter of a century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legislation such as that proposed in this Bill was recommended by  Mr Justice  Woodward in the first report of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is sincere in all the statements it makes about equalising the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual, helping the underprivileged and all those sorts of things, why does it not do something about the equalisation of fuel prices throughout Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basically this is a policy to return a fixed percentage of revenue, and income tax <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the States and to return to a colonial system of government which was old hat 75 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We move to 22 May 1975 when the Attorney-General announced that he had referred the matter of the most appropriate legislative means of safeguarding individuals’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties in relation to the Australia Police to the Australian Law Reform Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As Burke said, the moment you abate anything from the full <span class="highlight">rights</span> of men each to govern himself and suffer any artificial positive limitation upon those <span class="highlight">rights</span>, from that moment the whole organisation of government becomes a consideration of convenience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the field of the protection of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the Parliament will recall that very important law, the Racial Discrimination Act, which established a Commissioner for Community Relations and also a Community Relations Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I remind them of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill by which my predecessor valiantly tried to upgrade human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Australia, only to have the Bill defeated by the Opposition and ultimately killed by the prorogation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Memories are very short but I hope they are not so short that we cannot remember the Vietnam moratorium marches, the anti-apartheid demonstrations, the anti-conscription rallies and the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> demonstrations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These matters would complement the powers already conferred by the Constitution on the Australian Parliament with respect of marriage under section 5 1 (xxi) of the Constitution, and under section 5 1 (xxii) with respect to divorce and matrimonial causes and, in relation thereto, parental <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the custody and guardianship of infants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Parliament can legislate with respect to parental <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the custody and guardianship of infants only where the infants were born in wedlock and the parents are in dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They want to know what <span class="highlight">rights</span> and what conventions are being broken by State Liberal governments in appointing people to the Upper House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things about which they are really upset is this redistribution which attempts to take away some of their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All they are interested in is a system that will disadvantage country Australians and help the Labor Party no matter what violence is done to the real political <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people who live outside the capital cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly has no real respect for the democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Australian people, especially those who live outside the great cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet he is prepared to close his eyes to the unfairness and the injustice of these proposals in his determination to do everything that he can- and he has boasted about this often enough- to disadvantage and to hurt country people and to trample on their <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the desperate effort and, I must admit, need to try to bolster the position of the Labor Government at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been through this argument time and time again because of the Minister’s stubborn attachment to his objective of damaging to the maximum extent possible the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and opportunities of country people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We oppose these proposals because they are unfair and unjust and have no place in a country which claims to have any real interest in the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all of its citizens, including the nonmetropolitan citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Forget about justice and forget about the people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently the AttorneyGeneral  (Mr Enderby)  announced that assistance to the value of about $5,000 to $6,000 would be given to a woman at Ferntree Gully to fight against quarry operations which were allegedly despoiling the environment and encroaching onto the communal <span class="highlight">rights</span> of nearby residents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There seems to be an ideological battle going on aU the time between centralists and State lighters- those who think that all power should be at the centre and those who think that for some reason the States have some inalienable <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was justifying State <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I take the opportunity to express my appreciation to the States for their co-operation in arriving at what I believe is a good solution, and certainly a fair solution, for people who whether or not they had accumulated legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> would have been seriously disadvantaged if an arrangement of this sort had not been possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such an authority could ensure that the public was fully consulted, that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the community and of individuals were upheld, and that land values were regulated so that some individuals did not gain unearned windfalls from taxpayers’ money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is extremely important that that sort of assistance be given by the Australian Government and that environmental impact studies and public inquiries be carried out if all people in the community are to have their <span class="highlight">rights</span> observed and the community <span class="highlight">rights</span> observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a policy, as the Committee points out, need not be and it is not intended that it would be in derogation of States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that he will have the courage of his convictions and express the views that he sincerely feels about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Timorese people to determine their own future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me remind honourable members once again that nine of the Vietnamese refugees have been denied basic political <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Australia and this is something that has never happened before in the history of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There again in that particular area there have been numerous cases where, simply because of the inability of the migrant to understand his <span class="highlight">rights</span> and entitlements from government departmentsthis could apply particularly in relation to the Department of Social Security- he has been denied those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is as well for the Government to remember that it has a responsibility to ensure that <span class="highlight">rights</span> to every citizen, to every worker, are not denied simply because of the inability of the worker, being a migrant, to communicate in the normally used English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There can be no doubt, as all of us see the situation, that the citizens of this country are demanding that some action be taken about their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In all the areas that we might recognise as regions we should have these legal aid and consumer protection offices- not based, as I said, on the concept of waiting in the office for the people to come in but actively agitating out in the community and advising the people of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the manner in which they should go about their shopping. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We may differ in approach along the road to achieving our objectives but I hope that adequate laws to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of consumers are beyond argument in the political context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Arising from the Government’s decision to appoint a judge to head the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, this Bill ensures that such an appointment of a judge does not affect his tenure of office as a judge, or the salary, allowances and other <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges that he has by virtue of his judicial office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section 13 of the Law Reform Commission Act 1973, for example, enables a judge to be appointed as a commissioner and retain his judicial status and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> which attach to that status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable member for Bennelong has said, the proposed consumer protection authority will not work if it concentrates solely on the buyer and not on the seller and if it seeks to protect the buyer without regard for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the seller. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to remind honourable gentlemen of some of the things that the Government has been able to do in respect of women’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We ratified the 1953 United Nations Convention on the Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span> of Women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members seem to be under a misapprehension as to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Chair at question time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Chair on answers to questions are those <span class="highlight">rights</span> which are provided to the Chair by the Standing Orders of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir, if you look at May’s  Parliamentary Practice  and particularly at the practice of the House of Commons you will see that what you have said conflicts with standing order 1 because the  Speaker  of the House of Commons does exercise authority when Ministers abuse, as Ministers have done in this House, their <span class="highlight">rights</span> in answering questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a measure which, if carried into force by vote of the people, will have a long and far-reaching effect on the respective <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities not only of this Parliament but also of the Parliaments of the various States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, I find it anomalous that the Commonwealth should have a power in respect of family law matters covering divorce, property <span class="highlight">rights</span> arising out of divorce situations, marriage and so forth, whereas the States retain legal responsibility for such matters as legitimacy and adoption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that this is a measure which uniquely affects the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States and therefore the States have a right to communicate their views not only on the principle involved but also on the means by which the Government has chosen to implement that principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we do assert is that because it goes so fundamentally to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States they are entitled to express their views to this Parliament before the measure is passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I think the House ought to remember that the legal profession does have experience in the provision of legal aid services and must play a very substantial role in any system devised for the provision of legal aid, because however much people may take sideswipes at the legal profession the fact is that an independent legal profession is an important safeguard of individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> in a democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand it is very likely that this Parliament has power to legislate so as to provide legal aid to citizens who are exercising their Federal <span class="highlight">rights</span> before Federal courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let it be clear that this is not a matter, and is not being put forward as a matter, of State <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously a Federal Parliament which passes laws which create <span class="highlight">rights</span>, duties and obligations has a real consideration in relation to those citizens who are enforcing those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Houses of this Parliament are entitled to pass laws which effectively provide legal aid for people enforcing federal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> which people have in this country spring out of State law and not out of Federal law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously from the point of view of the public the most effective legal aid office will be one which enables the officers to give legal aid to people, whatever the source of their <span class="highlight">rights</span>, be it Federal or State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the independence of the legal profession is dealt a blow, that will deal a blow to this country and to our basic <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some people who are supposedly affluent who are deprived of their legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> because they cannot afford to go into litigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it will serve the function of educator of the people in relation to legal aid and legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> and part of its function will be the researching of areas where social change for the benefit of the Aus.tralian disadvantaged can be effected through reforms in law and other legal means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Opposition accept that no person should be denied the opportunity of ascertaining his or her substantive legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> simply because of lack of means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a society which can afford it, the exercise of <span class="highlight">rights</span> should be available to all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one reason why we believe in cooperative federalism and why we suggest that the existing system throughout the States should be supplemented so that the needy receive their just legal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that their <span class="highlight">rights</span> ought not to be denied because of lack of means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the existence of an independent legal profession is vital for the adequate protection of the individual against the state- that point was made very well by the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott)-  and the proper protection of individual freedoms, <span class="highlight">rights</span> and property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no head of power under the Constitution entitling the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws generally with respect to legal aid, but it may be supposed that it can legislate to provide legal aid as an incident to the enforcement of <span class="highlight">rights</span> under legislation of the Commonwealth Parliament- for example, under the Bankruptcy Act or under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Equality before the law can only be meaningful if each individual had the ability to exercise his <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whatever the views of the Australian Government about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or wrongs of the Papua New Guinea claim for an adjustment to the border, that Government- whatever its political complexion- would have been faced on the one hand by a clear demand for adjustment by the Government of Papua New Guinea and on the other by the unwillingness of the Queensland Government to accept any change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been clear from the outset that the Torres Strait Islanders shared with the Government of Queensland a general reluctance to see any change in the present location of the border, in the status and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Torres Strait Islanders as Australian citizens, but that in addition they attached great, perhaps even over-riding, importance to the protection of the total environment of the Torres Strait which they saw not merely as the basis of their livelihood but of their characteristic and independent way of life <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a statement following the same discussions,  Mr Somare  also said that his Government was conscious of the existing <span class="highlight">rights</span>, including land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, of the Islanders and intended that these should be safeguarded in any settlement that might be reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All present residents of Torres Strait Islands and their descendants to retain Australian citizenship and all <span class="highlight">rights</span> of that citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Section 123 of the Constitution guarantees the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of States to determine whether their borders will be changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Prime Minister sought to ride over not only the Constitution but also the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Islanders and of the Queenslanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one can argue that those with a need for legal advice, or with <span class="highlight">rights</span> to be asserted or defended, should not have access to able lawyers and to the courts but the means of providing, within the welfare state, a legal social service is a matter of some debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optimistic ambitions for the future do nothing actually to remedy the situation of the thousands of Australians who are being exploited and compromised daily through ignorance of their legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> and a sheer lack of means to defend them in court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to speak on the matter of political <span class="highlight">rights</span> around the world and in Indonesia in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a tragedy that around the world most countries which are members of the United Nations are bound by the Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, yet there are violations of those <span class="highlight">rights</span> to various degrees of incidence in more than a hundred of the member countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Union, Spain, South Korea, Uganda, Argentina and Brazil are among the countries with long records of violations of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be held in prison without trial and without recourse to justice is probably one of the greatest infringements of the basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> of freedom and liberty, particularly when the Indonesian officials admit that such prisoners were not involved with the coup in 1965. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of those gaoled last year was Buyung Nasution, a lawyer and the director of the legal aid bureau, who had sought to advise and defend the civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> of so many Indonesians who were victims of the purges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hoped that that is a sign of progress by the Indonesian Government, and I hope that Buyung Nasution will be able to practise quite freely after his release, without restriction, to assist people to exercise their human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if we ignore infringements of liberty, freedom and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of men and women throughout the world we cheapen the respect we hold for our own freedoms and we move closer to the total enslavement of all mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people do have <span class="highlight">rights</span> and they must be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is ridiculous to suggest that the present system allows everybody to exercise their <span class="highlight">rights</span> as far as preferences are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people want to exercise their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and to extend the situation which occurred in 1974, in the not too distant future we will see in New South Wales three hundred or four hundred candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people want to exercise their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to prove a point- I would not suggest that honourable members opposite should laugh- and there are 300 or 400 candidates for the Senate in New South Wales, it will take 6 months for the Electoral Office to count the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not want to cut off certain votes and, as is proposed in later Bills, place other restrictions on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people simply because it helps the Labor Party which argues that under such a system the result could be known by midnight of the day of counting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill provides the greatest step forward so far taken in protecting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to which we as consumers and as members of the Australian public are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, if the time for casting a vote, the availability and number of polling booths and the way in which postal votes can be lodged are restricted the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people are restricted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s proposal is that where a person in the employment of Australia, a State or some public authority is sent overseas in the service of Australia, the authority or the State, he and his spouse are entitled to retain their enrolment and voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this particular clause the Government is seeking to facilitate the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of certain citizens to vote in parliamentary elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While several States have moved towards the recognition of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, this legislation goes much further than has previously been contemplated in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill will give effect to the recommendations of the second report of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission- the Woodward report- and grant land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Aboriginals in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill will establish in our law those aspects of Aboriginal traditional law relating to land which  Mr Justice  Blackburn could not uphold in 1971 in the Gove land <span class="highlight">rights</span> case: It creates for Aboriginals proprietary interests in, and communal title to, land, and makes that title inalienable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was, he went on, ‘a virtual command by 5 700 000 Australians that the national Government should take a lead to promote (among other things) the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginals’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He further stated in his policy speech before the national election in December 1972 that a Labor government would legislate to give Aboriginals land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, ‘not just because their case is beyond argument, but because all of us as Australians are diminished while the Aboriginals are denied their rightful place in this nation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition takes the view that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals, which are so fundamentally touched by any method of telephone tapping, as it is commonly known, by any method of telecommunications interception, ought ideally to be within the responsibility of the Government’s first law officer; that is, the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As has already been pointed out by the honourable member for Bennelong  (Mr Howard),  we will accept the amendments which have been proposed, but we have doubts as to whether it is necessary for the Prime Minister to take unto himself such very vital responsibilities in relation to individual <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We put it under the control of a judge who was trained in the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms of the British people under British law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the present Opposition came into power it put the security organisation under the control of a military person- I think it was  Colonel Spry-  who was not trained to the same degree as a member of the judiciary in the freedoms and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the British people, which applied also to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The appointment of a Judge as Director, or service of a Judge as Director, does not affect the tenure of his office as a Judge or his rank, title, status, precedence, salary, annual or other allowances or other <span class="highlight">rights</span> or privileges as the holder of his office as a Judge, and for all purposes his service as Director shall be taken to be service as the holder of his office as a Judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I submit these are real dangers in such a course of action for the protection of individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>After paragraph ( f) of sub-clause ( 1 ), insert the following paragraph:- (fa) to advise the Attorney-General as to the educational programs that would be most effective in promoting an understanding by the public, or by sections of the public who have special needs in this respect, of their <span class="highlight">rights</span>, powers, privileges and duties under the laws of Australia and of the Territories; and ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is opening a Pandora’s box to provide in a Bill that legal aid shall be given in any matter involving public interest without requiring the person seeking the legal aid, or the group of persons, to comply with the eligibility criteria laid down in respect of the pursuit of individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> and individual actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is one thing that is fundamental in our democracy, in our system of British justice, in our understanding of the common law <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the citizen, it is that each citizen not only should have the opportunity to receive the services of the law but also should have the right to obtain the services of the lawyer of his choice, who is independent of everyone- government and individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thereby the law, through the lawyer who provides the services, may stand as a bulwark between the government and the citizen or, in litigation or conflict between citizens, may stand up for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of one citizen against another before the independent courts of the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish briefly to express a concern which really follows upon the concern I expressed in relation to subclause (4) of clause 29, and that is that a party or group of persons may, under the fairly wide criteria which I envisage under clause 29, be given legal assistance in respect of an action which does not involve the prosecution of individual <span class="highlight">rights</span>, which does not involve an attempt to recover damages or to assert a claim to property, but which might, for example, involve an environmental action against a particular company, either large or small. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But if we have to use these sexist analogies, the difference between the conduct of the Government and the conduct of the Opposition is the world of difference between the lawful exercise of conjugal <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the rapist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not only in these matters that the Prime Minister has trampled upon the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parliamentary system is being undermined, yet the present Leader of the Opposition, when he came into power earlier this year, made some fine speeches on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Traditions of Magna Carta, Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> and Parliament mean nothing to them, other than ancient his.torial interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today of course a pensioner enjoys the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> as far as medical treatment is concerned as do other sections of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even when they have been pursuing their political ends in the most ruthless way, they have always cloaked their tactics with the argument that they were exercising the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States ‘ House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In re-presenting these Bills the Government is intentionally reasserting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we add to that list the problems created by the behaviour of Parliament itself, the destruction of convention, the defiance of reason, the pursuit of power without concern for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or privileges of minorities, then Australians will have little faith in the future of Australian democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicate that this Bill now re-presented is part of what ought to be regarded as an historic battle for the assertion of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not going to be resolved by this House and the Labor Government backing down on what it believes are its fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are standing upon the assertion of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have at other times when I was in Opposition said, when money Bills were sent down to the Senate, that it was time that this House asserted its fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span>, its priority over the power of the purse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I still hope that there are some in this House who will assert the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this place and who will understand that the Opposition is bringing the constitutional arrangements into chaos. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would stand for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this House against the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think in this stand the resolution can come from only one direction, that is, by the Senate changing its attitude and by this House reasserting its fundamental, historical and commonsense <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Originally it was intended that that should not be a political House and that it should be purely a House of State representatives to guard the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason it was intended that that House should be purely a States <span class="highlight">rights</span> House with equal representation for the States- ten each, as it is today- irrespective of the population of each State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of particular importance to the Aboriginal community has been the attainment of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the Government has, as honourable members will recall, established the Aboriginal Land Fund in response to this felt need on the part of the Aboriginal community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore think it appropriate to state at the outset the total commitment of the Opposition Parties to the development and maintenance of laws which effectively protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of consumers in a society in which consumers are being increasingly offered a wider range of goods and services and are increasingly confronted with sophisticated sales techniques in both design and promotion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition will support and facilitate proper and reasonable legislation to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of consumers throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill provides the greatest step foward so far taken in protecting these <span class="highlight">rights</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could not help but feel that it seemed strange that the Minister should concentrate only one paragraph in that whole speech on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the consumer in a speech of some 1 9 paragraphs devoted to institutionalising the protection of those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He assures us that the Authority will provide the greatest step forward so far taken in protecting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to which we as consumers and members of the Australian public are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the purpose of this Bill is genuinely to expand and enforce consumer <span class="highlight">rights</span>, then one cannot help but feel that the allocation of $ 1 m could have been better spent by being channelled through the Trade Practices Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister again to consider allowing the Opposition and those interested in this legislation a reasonable period of time within which to consider the legislation and its impact upon the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the protection of consumers throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not sell out the constitutional <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This question of principle, of constitutional propriety, is not a matter between the House of Representatives and the Senate; it is a matter between the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the electors of Australia and a government which demonstrably has failed to fill the trust placed upon it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On each occasion that the Prime Minister makes the assertion that the Senate lacks the power to defer a money Bill he demonstrates completely his failure to understand the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of people in a democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does somebody on the other side of the House not get up and assert what the fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this House are? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to operate are protected in that in Part IX they are allowed the right of appeal to a tribunal should their application to the registrar be not approved, but what redress do they have against travel operators who are not agents? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It does not care about the sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States and shows its lack of care by not doing anything meaningful and significant to overcome those huge cost increases with regard to the total debt of the States and the total debt per head of population in the various States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The States have <span class="highlight">rights</span> under the Constitution; but those <span class="highlight">rights</span> can be torpedoed and sabotaged by a hostile centralised government which does not recognise the particular position of the States in a co-operative operative federalist system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We on this side of the House support a measure which will give land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is to say, 23 per cent of the Northern Territory is subject to claim under these Bills and particularly the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again the question that inevitably comes up is the question of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of existing holders of interest in Crown lands off reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of traditional owners to decide what should happen on their lands is a matter of great significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us who sympathise very much with the claims for Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> naturally feel that the Aboriginal people should have the right to say whether mining ventures should be conducted on their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do they understand that this could be a means whereby Aborigines in other parts of Australia could obtain title or <span class="highlight">rights</span> to land in the Northern Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do they understand that people of the Torres Strait Islands for instance could gain <span class="highlight">rights</span> to land in the Northern Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I cross-examined Aboriginals in the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> case I got the same impression coming back to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>True it is that the Aboriginal people ought to be entitled to be free from interference with their traditional fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the like, but if this provision remains people will be excluded from the areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On behalf of the Government I welcome his statement that the Opposition recognises and supports Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does so very largely because although all States except Queensland have accepted Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in some way, the Northern Territory has the overwhelming number of traditionally oriented people and for them land <span class="highlight">rights</span> are very much a different matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are quite different from the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines in a community like Cherbourg, near Brisbane, for example- and I do not denigrate in any way the right of the people of Cherbourg to own their own land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a matter of regret and I am told by the legal people that it is impossible to write a simple Bill to cater for a problem as complex as Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that it will be possible for us to pass them through both Houses of the Parliament as soon as possible because one thing that is certain is that the question of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> is a test of the credibility of this Government and every government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The elaborate argument that the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott)  spun out in the House this afternoon would have been a good deal more credible if honourable members had not been vividly aware of the time which has elapsed since the question of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> was first raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member elaborated his argument at extraordinary length, but honourable members all recalled while he was speaking the stonewall resistance put up over a period of years to the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> claims of the Gurindji by successive Country Party Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most honourable members would have been aware that behind the honourable member’s request for time to study this legislation- allegedly in the interests of securing better Bills- was a plea for time to reconcile the differences which have arisen over this question of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> between the Liberal Party and the National Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the contrary though National Country Party members have always taken a very lively interest in Aboriginal affairs and especially in the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the National Country Party speaks in this place precisely for those groups in our society who see themselves as threatened by land <span class="highlight">rights</span> becoming available to Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are witnessing this last ditch attempt on the part of the honourable member for Wentworth to have the whole affair referred to yet another committee because the Country Party lives in hope that the matter of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aborigines, like the matter of electoral reform and one vote one value, can be staved off in the hope of an electoral miracle which will somehow make these issues dead letters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was because of the determination of the land holders in the area whose interests are spoken for in this place by the Country Party to see that the issue of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> was killed stone dead at its inception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the honourable member for Kennedy  (Mr Katter)  and the honourable member for the Northern Territory interrupted me, I was addressing myself to this question of land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was anxious to make the point that it is important to distinguish in this question of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> between those Aboriginal communities which have retained a sense of identity, which have retained a sense of purpose and which have forward looking aspirations of their own as is the case preeminently with the Gurindji, and those Aboriginal communities, such as the people of Lake Tyers in my own State, who have none of these attributes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The debate about land <span class="highlight">rights</span> is overwhelming- debate about the restoration of the sense of identity, about the restoration of a sense of self-respect to the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is to be effective, there must be some sensitive monitoring of the circumstances in which transfer of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> is encompassed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had a most unfortunate experience in my own State where, I believe, the Victorian Government would not have behaved differently in the matter of Lake Tyers if it had been the Government’s intention to discredit the whole notion of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> from the outset. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These were the circumstances in which the first transfer of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> took place in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The time already taken in investigation of these proposals and particularly in investigation of the proposal of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aborigines has been  very great, and there can be no question that the inquiry into land <span class="highlight">rights</span> carried out by  Mr Justice  Woodward was one of the most thorough and searching inquiries which has been seen in this country in recent years, yet the Opposition is anxious to see this legislation referred for yet another inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not sufficient that the Parliament should simply approve legislation setting up a framework within which land <span class="highlight">rights</span> can be legally handed over to Aboriginal communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very clear that if these communities are to take full advantage of the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> vested in them under this legislation, acceptable proposals will have to be made for a system of advisers to work with the Aboriginal communities because where great difficulties have arisen in the past, where there have been failures or the foreshadowing of failures in Aboriginal communities, has been where advice was foisted on the community from outside rather than where the means were provided for the community to obtain advice on its own account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make it very clear to the House that if advisers are to work successfully with the Aboriginal communities which take up land <span class="highlight">rights</span> under this legislation it will need to be on the basis of a system of grants handed over without strings to the communities concerned so that they can then go ahead and employ the advisers of their choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage of the development of the Aboriginal communities most likely to take up their <span class="highlight">rights</span> under this legislation, it is unquestionable that the services of advisers are needed even to carry through the most routine and bureaucratic aspects of their relationship with the wider community and particularly in their relationship with governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also claimed that the Australian Labor Party was the first party to introduce land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1971 the Legislative Council, as it then was, conferred land <span class="highlight">rights</span> on Aborigines under the Northern Territory Lands Ordinance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aborigines were given <span class="highlight">rights</span> on reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were given these <span class="highlight">rights</span> and lived under better conditions than at Balanda and elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although everyone supports Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, great consideration should be given to the delicate situation of people who are training Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not a scheme to delay land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are members of the Party which, when in government, produced a statement on land <span class="highlight">rights</span> on Australia Day 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is how their pronouncement on land <span class="highlight">rights</span> was received by the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cry has been to get legislation for land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, to formalise land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and to give effect to our commitment to provide land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as that one must say that this legislation will be a blueprint for Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> throughout the whole of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hot possible for this Parliament to legislate in respect of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is important is that a blueprint for that development is established so that hopefully there can be some development towards land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aboriginal people throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  says that legislation for land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Northern Territory is the prerogative of the Legislative  Assembly in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are trying to establish in a permanent way the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Northern Territory Aborigines to the land which they have been deprived of for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are trying to establish their traditional ownership <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are trying to establish the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, we are trying to establish the interests in a permanent way, of a section of that community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course some people will be upset, but I think that is just one of the consequences of trying to re-establish the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has the experience to speak on these definitions with great clarity because he was one of the leading figures in the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> case in 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His contribution was probably more substantial than that of anyone else associated with the hearings of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said before, this is one of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> which Aborigines in north Australia especially hold very sacred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hear them saying: ‘Everything was fine until you started to talk land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me tell honourable members opposite on their behalf that they are not going to deter them from their objectives, from their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and from the Government’s objective of giving effect to the Woodward principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the only measure in the Bill that attempts to give land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but the fact is that it gives no <span class="highlight">rights</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not confer <span class="highlight">rights</span> on anybody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It guarantees in no way whatsoever land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Land <span class="highlight">rights</span> are supposed to be secured to the Aboriginal people under the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The procedure therefore is completely without any form that gives land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, one asks this very basic question: Why is this measure supposed to guarantee land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far I have not been able to find a provision that guarantees land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the Aboriginal clans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Land <span class="highlight">rights</span> are left solely in the hands of a body which is very broadly based and which will, if a dispute arises, I would think, shatter the Aboriginal communities in a place like Arnhem Land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course we know that over a period the question of title to land and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people to particular land under Aboriginal lore would result in a loss of memory on the part of people as to who were the old traditional owners of the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find in these 2 clauses no basic guarantee of land <span class="highlight">rights</span>; no basic guarantee of natural justice to those who may require some sort of a hearing; and no independent body set up in order to determine matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are the bases of <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we intend giving land <span class="highlight">rights</span> we should recognise those facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will arise in the future particularly when questions of mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the like are important and significant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Aboriginal people, for instance, are to be given <span class="highlight">rights</span> in relation to 2 kilometres of sea how will the area be divided if the Aboriginal lands meet one another at the shore line? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise them so that for the future- as we are laying guidelines for the future- we guarantee the <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the proper way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is only one thing to do in the question of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and that is get on with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I expect that the first battles were joined around the Yirrkala people and their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to their land back in 1963. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want to do anything about this matter it is to preserve for the real Aboriginals their real <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some may have some kinds of <span class="highlight">rights</span> over land; some another kind of right over the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some may have hunting <span class="highlight">rights</span>; some may have other <span class="highlight">rights</span> such as ceremonial <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am not in favour of this kind of simplistic idea that we can take Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> which are complex and just put them into our simple Procrustean bed of ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who knows anything about the way in which these Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> work as between themselves would not be committing this kind of simplistic mistake which is in a way an outrage against real Aboriginality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were in office a long time- 23 yearswithout doing anything effective on land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman talks about land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He says that there is nothing in the legislation effectively to bestow on people <span class="highlight">rights</span> over their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not one constructive proposal has been put forward by them as to how this legislation could be made better in respect of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of ownership of Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> that are available to non-Aboriginal people are also available to Aboriginal people who are in dispute about ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He must know that we have here land ownership of a highly puritanical variety which gives to the Aboriginal people uncluttered, unfettered <span class="highlight">rights</span> which are almost unparalleled and which are as good as the Torrens title system that operates in several of the eastern States of Australia and any other system that operates anywhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will have <span class="highlight">rights</span> as to who enters onto it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will have <span class="highlight">rights</span> as to its utilisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In every respect we can say to the Aboriginal people in an unambiguous and unequivocal way that they have unfettered <span class="highlight">rights</span> over their land in such a way that few of them would ever have believed to have been possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott)-  the conflicting names of honourable members and electorates is terribly confusing- spoke about the question of land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I expect that somebody with a flair for English could express in similar terms what land <span class="highlight">rights</span> are about, and that could be written into the preamble of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until you can guarantee to the particular group its right to particular land you have not given them land <span class="highlight">rights</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is in a sense a mere matter of form so far as land <span class="highlight">rights</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is nothing in the measure that gives <span class="highlight">rights</span> to particular groups, to particular traditional owners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have no <span class="highlight">rights</span> at all in this legislation as far as I can find. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only add that not to bore the Committee but simply to explain what I meant and why I feel that these provisions, which are really the whole basis of the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> question, need further consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge the need for informal proceedings but there are certain basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> like the right to be heard, the right to know that there is a hearing, the right to bring some evidence, for instance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are certain basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> that we all think are important, and they are just as important to the Aboriginal people in the context of giving them land <span class="highlight">rights</span> as they are to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have <span class="highlight">rights</span> over it’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now are talking about traditional land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are proposing to put the preservation of their traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the hands of Aboriginals whom nominally they will choose themselves but who actually, because they are more articulate and live in Darwin and there is this big overall thing, will be people that they really would not want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least I hope it will never be made more restrictive in respect of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it necessarily desirable that Aboriginal people who are not completely fullbloods should not participate in some way in these land councils and be given some land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again urge reconsideration of these provisions in terms of the very concept of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for particular groups or communities and in relation to particular land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think I need to say any more about the fact that land trusts are to be directed by the Land Council so that the land owner really exercises no <span class="highlight">rights</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wherever one looks in the Bill one finds a problem in terms of land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, land ownership in the ordinary sense that we would understand it, and I believe in the ordinary sense that Aboriginal people would understand it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a denial of <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the local Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have hunting <span class="highlight">rights</span>, foraging <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and even ceremonial <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the ceremonial <span class="highlight">rights</span> are divided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would think that the inclusion of clause 40 (2) really takes away from Aboriginals all that they themselves mean by land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue at stake is the basic constitutional <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole tactic of the Leader of the Opposition has been to bypass this House, to undermine its established <span class="highlight">rights</span> and authority- <span class="highlight">rights</span> and authority which have never been challenged since Federation and would not be challenged in any other country with a comparable system of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not the least extraordinary and reprehensible aspect of his conduct is that he would sell out the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And, of course, in so doing he would sell out the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Australian people by the selling the people ‘s House down the drain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when one considers the lengths he is apparently prepared to go to damage Australia, to cause harm to innocent people, to delay or even destroy the chance of economic recovery and in particular, the role he is playing in attempting to undermine the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and powers of this House- this House of Representatives, this people’s House- he is unfit to be Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of another place with respect to this House in what are called financial matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>House is prepared to defend the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the powers and the purposes of this House as against the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general policy is that the Australian Government, in accordance with its constitutional <span class="highlight">rights</span> in relation to property used for Australian Government purposes, does not pay rates on such property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-7-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Besides satisfying land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the Aboriginal groups involved, it was also intended that the properties would provide the communities with an economic base. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-7-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the events of 1 1 November- momentous for the Parliament, for  the strength and vitality of our democratic institutions, for Australia’s reputation in the worldthe honourable member for Corio emerged as a true and valiant defender of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no fault of the honourable member for Corio that his message went unheeded and unheard, that the Governor-General refused to see him until after the dissolution of Parliament was proclaimed, that the  Speaker  was insulted by the representative of the Queen, and that the office of  Speaker  and all the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges it embodies were treated with contempt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not rest in his endeavours to redress the wrong that was done to this institution and to defend the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of honourable members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Australian Parliament in relation to the Crown remain unclear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the supreme challenge came to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this Parliament he bore himself with dignity and carried out his tasks with the highest conception of his duty to the institution he serves and the cause of Australian democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-4-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  last action was to vindicate the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this House against what was an act of very great discourtesy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-4-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is consistent with the attitudes shown towards the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the House by the holder of that office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-4-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No reference was made from the other side to the importance of the speakership in vindicating the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-4-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I say that in Australia the tradition of vindicating the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this House in the formation of a government and its <span class="highlight">rights</span>  vis-a-vis  the Crown is very defective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-4-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that as a result the Australian Constitution will be observed and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and interests of the Australian people protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-4-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has had removed from it <span class="highlight">rights</span> which people’s houses, including the House of Commons, have had for 700 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-4-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has been a member for 23 years, but he has not had 23 years experience, he has had one year’s experience 23 times because he is a remarkably slow learner of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and duties of the people for whom he deliberates, particularly members of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One is the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of every member, including members of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore in the opinion of this House, legislation should be introduced protecting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and standing of the Aboriginal people in the tribal lands affected by the Agreement, and providing for the recognition of traditional Aboriginal owners in the Aurukun area as those Aboriginal people who have common spiritual affiliations to a site on the land and who are entitled by Aboriginal tradition to forage as of right over that land; and providing for the recognition of traditions, observances, customs and beliefs as applied in relation to the people of Aboriginal race at Aurukun, and to sites and areas of land at Aurukun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Naturally we favour a return to peaceful development and deplore breaches of” human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, terrorism and atrocities wherever they occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that I was grieved somewhat by the cavalier fashion in which the previous House of Representatives was prepared to vacate what I think are its historic <span class="highlight">rights</span> because of a chance difference in the political constitution of the upper House as against the lower. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I believe that this House has to defend its <span class="highlight">rights</span> as a House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our Government suffered continual harassment in another place, not about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States or anything else but simply because of the political numbers the then Opposition could not get its way in this place but was able occasionally to combine its numbers to get its way in another place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In similar fashion their objections to other pieces of associated legislation simply complicated the transition from the old health insurance scheme to the new Medibank, deprived members of the public of protection of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> as contributors to private health funds and stopped implementation of reforms in the supervision of health insurance organisations, as had been recommended by the Nimmo Committee inquiry into health insurance which was set up, honourable members will recall, by the then LiberalCountry Party Government in the late 1 960s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Bill will ensure that the appointment of a judge as Director-General of Security does not affect his tenure of office as a judge, or the salary, allowances and other <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges that he has by virtue of his judicial office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section 13 of the Law Reform Commission Act 1973 similarly enables a judge to be appointed as a Commissioner and to retain his judicial status and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> which attach to that status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Speaker,  entrusted as he is with the responsibility of safeguarding the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and traditions of the House, in my view could do well to consider instituting a process involving the Privileges Committee and of putting all these matters under examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The responsibility with which the  Speaker  has been entrusted to safeguard and uphold the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, dignity and traditions of this Parliament can be adequately fulfilled only if the  Speaker,  in my view, takes the course available to him and has these matters incorporated into comprehensive terms of reference for the attention of the Privileges Committee which would comprise members from both sides of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 10 000 Islanders would strongly oppose any agreement or solution which does not continue to recognise and preserve their status as Australians and Queenslanders, their islands as Australian territory, and their traditional fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the waters of Torres Strait. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the immense practical difficulties experienced by individual citizens in exercising their <span class="highlight">rights</span> under the Act without expensive legal costs, and in the light of his assertion this afternoon that he is willing to institute proceedings under the Act, will he ask for a report on newspaper companies which mislead the general public with bogus claims of exclusive stories, particularly disgraceful pieces on  Her  Royal Highness The Princess Margaret, or are the activities of the Murdoch empire, no matter how revolting and how distasteful, completely off limits to his Department? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 6 of the principal Act to ensure, inter alia, that the appointment of a judge as Director does not affect his <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges as the holder of his judicial office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is vital that the Organisation should be independent from secret political control because this is the key to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like an assurance from the Attorney-General  (Mr Ellicott)  that this independence so clearly laid down by this House will not be abridged by secret terms and conditions of appointment because the independence of the Director-General of ASIO isperhaps paradoxically- the key to our individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United States of America is proud of its name and I am proud of the name ‘Commonwealth of Australia’ for the same reason, because it signifies the unity that was brought about when various States were prepared to give up part of their separate privileges and <span class="highlight">rights</span> to bring about a unified country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not intend to pursue a discussion on the Constitution or a discussion as to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of governments or lower houses under the Constitution; I intend to deal with what I believe is the one overriding, pervasive requirement imposed on governments in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I emphasise that the new guidelines in no way impair the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and protection of those genuinely seeking work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We hope it has a speedy passage and that there will not be too much emotional nonsense talked about States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> and associated matters from the Government benches during this debate, which nonsense would delay the passage of this essential measure through the Parliament and would not add to the body of knowledge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Speaker  of this Parliament has a grave responsibility to protect not only the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members of this Parliament but also the parliamentary institution itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It represented a tearingup, as a result of Labor policy, of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals who had entered into very important engagements in the legal sphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a clear example of the Labor Party’s much vaunted respect for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the little man being seen to be completely nullified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The world economic order of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the International Monetary Fund is cracking and will steadily disintegrate, hence the recent Rambouillet conference of 8  Major nations  to demonetise gold, replacing it with special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is a multiple reserve currency whereby the obligation, so far solely upon the United States, would be shared by other major powers, and the other is the adoption of the special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> as a principal reserve asset. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the latter choice at Rambouillet it yet remains to be seen whether special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be able fully to finance the growth of a world in which most nations still tend to prefer the possession of gold as a major reserve asset. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A government with the slightest respect for free institutions and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members of the Parliament, a government with an ounce of sensitivity to the public’s anxiety on this matter, would at least feel obliged to explain and justify this gross departure from democratic practice, this gross abuse of the law enforcement agencies of the Crown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one’s long term view of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and position of Parliament is dependent on whether or not at the time one has a majority, Parliament itself has no real role to play. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It also raises the question of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of parliamentary democracy to prevail without the intrusion by individuals who are not elected by the people of this country and to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of parliamentarians to carry out their obligations to the people who elect them without interference from the Commonwealth police or any other organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The so-called right to property is central to the program of the Workers Party and its supporters characterise the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australian citizens to education, health care and equal opportunity as privileges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To the credit of the Ministers who sat on this side of the chamber in the former Government and who had responsibility in the area of Aboriginal affairs and in the area of urban and regional development, as it then was, I am pleased to record the pleasure that members of the Committee felt in receiving some advance notice so that they had an opportunity to discuss with Ministers Bills, as they then were, on such matters as Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the National Estate, which had particular interest to the Aboriginal people and which related to their own national heritage, which is of the utmost importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one is to talk about land <span class="highlight">rights</span> or Aborigines, go and speak to the people who know something about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is tremendous pressure from outside the Territory and from some of the advisers and would-be experts on Aboriginal affairs, to see that the Bills for Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> or whatever are not referred to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least one cannot be unaware of the powerful economic forces that are now in operation in some of the areas that are supposed to be the land areas of the Aboriginal population and the problems such as whether we will take uranium, whether we will take bauxite, whether we will take some other minerals without consideration for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They .deal with persons whose contributions to the superannuation scheme have been deferred on their becoming eligible members of the DFRDB scheme, the preservation of <span class="highlight">rights</span> provisions as they relate to persons transferring from one scheme to the other and, in accordance with past practice, the ex-officio appointment of the Commissioner for Superannuation, in lieu of the  President  of the Superannuation Board, as  chairman  of the DFRDB Authority and the DFRB Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we add to that list the problems created by the behaviour of Parliament itself- the destruction of convention, the defiance of reason, the pursuit of power without concern for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of minorities- Australians will have little faith in the future of Australian democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The particular point is the need to ensure that in this country there is a proper remedy whereby people who, in a particular class, have suffered in general from some impediment of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> are able to have an action brought on their behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that honourable members opposite, particularly the honourable member for St George, interested as he is in the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens, will take up this matter with the 2 Ministers concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: Will he assure the House that the safeguards provided for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginal people will be at least those proposed in the Aboriginal Land (Northern Territory) Bill 1975, namely, either the joint consent of the Minister and of a land council representing the Aboriginal people to the granting of the mining interest, or the declaration by the GovernorGeneral, by proclamation, that it is in the national interest that such a grant be made, with this Parliament having the right to disallow the proclamation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The criticisms made by the honourable member for Gellibrand indicate that he, and I assume other honourable members opposite, have not read the Minister’s statement, which was a balanced statement with an eye to reasonable administrative efficiencies and carefully considered safeguards for human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we will continue to use the appellate system to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual, we also will expect the Appeals Tribunal to be more realistic and effective in the task before it and not simply to pass people just because an appeal has been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, when read in conjunction with other outbursts by the Government on industrial matters, the statement is seen as an insidious attempt to prevent unions from fighting for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of their members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not think that such a system is an infringement of individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> of privacy, unless it is linked or is capable of being linked by computer to taxation records, Medibank records, bank accounts, driving records, etc, or unless unreasonable demands are made on its use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the complications of the new Family Law Act- the protection is much greater than under the old Matrimonial Causes Act but the new Act is much more complicated and accordingly needs qualified legal opinion and legal assistance for interpretation- such a woman who may be on a deserted wife’s pension, for example will be forced to go to a private solicitor and pay $120 to protect her legal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The particular sources of concern with the proposals, which I am advised did become law on 14 February of this year are, firstly, the description of Poland as a ‘socialist state’; secondly, a reference to the Polish United Workers Partythat is, of course, the Communist Party- as the leading political force in the country; thirdly, a reference to Poland’s alliance with the Soviet Union; and, fourthly, a clause that would have made citizens’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> contingent upon their fulfilling duties towards the state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, referring to the last point of the specific changes that I mentioned, namely, the clause that would make citizens’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> contingent upon their fulfilling duties towards the state, I should say that I understand that in Poland there continues to be vocal opposition to the law as there does elsewhere in the world by Polish citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government naturally would regret any move to inhibit the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms of Polish citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Declaration on the <span class="highlight">Rights</span> of the Child puts it that ‘The child, for the full and harmonious development of his personality, needs love and understanding . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to emphasise that I do not deny women the right to choose their lifestyle in the community provided that their choice does not impinge on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He showed how this libertarian society involves not merely a claim for absolute <span class="highlight">rights</span> to live according to one’s own desires but also a demand for facilities for that lifestyle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As most dependent spouses are widows rather than widowers, this is decidedly an improvement in the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because of this (and the existing <span class="highlight">rights</span> to retire on full pension at age 60) the Commonwealth may feel obliged to provide again for full benefits at age sixty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The other aspect is that the lump sum return under the Crean scheme could be used to purchase additional pension <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A contributor must use the whole of the lump sum to purchase additional pension <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He cannot say that he will take half as a lump sum payment and use half to purchase additional pension <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another important example of inflexibility is the denial of the right to pick up units which have been rejected and which, under the Crean scheme, people would have been able to pick up 3 months before or 3 months after a new scheme was introduced and claim them as full pension <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has to accept the responsibility which goes with the conditions, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the privileges which the Government confers upon it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, as I read the Bill- I am subject to correction in this respect- the preservation <span class="highlight">rights</span> apply only on movement to other public employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it needs to be made quite clear that the Scarf Memorial Foundation is not the principal Australian organisation which trades with Arab countries nor does the Scarf Memorial Foundation have sole trading <span class="highlight">rights</span> with Arab countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-50-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the qualifying or vesting period for preservation of <span class="highlight">rights</span> has been reduced from 20 years to 5 years, so that if a woman wishes after 5 years to leave the Public Service for reasons of child rearing, she can do so, return at a later date and have her <span class="highlight">rights</span> preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where a public servant wishes to transfer to the private sector his <span class="highlight">rights</span> are preserved if he qualifies for the period of 5 years to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, in the process, it would want to be quite certain that it protected the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all Australians, obviously including the Torres Strait Islander-the right to their traditional way of life, to the islands that they inhabit, to the seas that they fish and to the way that they live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is there any real need to tell us what the situation is in central Europe and eastern Europe concerning civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> and human <span class="highlight">rights</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is one of the great misfortunes of this planet at the moment that of its 1 50 countries or thereabouts there is only a handful of them in which human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> prosper, but they are being trampled on every day all round the world and not the least by people such as the honourable member for Mackellar and the kind of political party of which he is a member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am like the honourable member for Mackellar, as are my colleagues on this side of the House, in that I despise the trampling of civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> and human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sufficient of an idealist to believe that where freedoms and basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> are threatened anywhere in the world it is the duty of those who support those basic freedoms and human <span class="highlight">rights</span> to stand up in their defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no qualms in saying that where those <span class="highlight">rights</span> are threatened by totalitarian regimes, either of the right or of the left, in the northern hemisphere or in the southern hemisphere, I will do my bit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that 10 February 1976 will be remembered by all Australians who believe in freedom as a day of shame for international democracy, a day of the deprivation of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of the people of Poland, and a day of sadness for all who love freedom and all who believe that one day we will see a free Poland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have seen uprising of the workers- the very same people who are supposed to be represented by those people on the other side of the House, those who support the Labor Party, those who support the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the ordinary worker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 would have thought that in 1976 members of the Australian Labor Party would be prepared to come out and say that this is one further assault on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of the workers in another country which we will not tolerate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great hypocrisy of the decision of 10 February is that last year at the Helsinki Conference Poland was one of the 34 countries which .signed a solemn treaty ratifying the Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the declaration by Poland that it was ratifying the Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> at the conference in Helsinki they thought to themselves: ‘Here is a great chance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly at about that time the Polish United Workers -Congress, which in fact is the Communist Party,- at its congress, instead of agreeing to those things which were being requested, decided that it would take the alternative course of not only denying those freedoms but also of taking away 3 basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> which hitherto had been the entitlement of the people of Poland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What it wants to write into the Constitution amounts to a denial of the right of political association, of the formation of parties and of any real chance of an effective opposition in the Polish Parliament; secondly, the taking away of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of an independent and free Polish foreign policy by writing into the Constitution that,  ipso facto,  the foreign policy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, will be, for all intents and purposes, the foreign policy of Poland; and, thirdly, by giving to an arm of the Executive, the State Council, an interpretive right- whatever the honourable member for Wills might say it is not the right of the Governor-General of Australia but in fact is the right of the High Court of Australia- to interpret the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In those 3 steps three basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> were taken away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>‘Parliamentary privilege’, says Erskine May, ‘is the sum of the peculiar <span class="highlight">rights</span> enjoyed by each House collectively as a constituent part of the High Court of Parliament, and by Members of each House individually, without which they could not discharge their functions . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, I come to what I regard and the Government regards as a very basic principle, that is whether or not governments should trench upon the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals to lend their support to political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the honourable gentleman serious when he says that this legislation does not trammel <span class="highlight">rights</span> at all? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the honourable gentleman: It is a significant invasion of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people to support political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have adverted to the fact that it represents a substantial invasion of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not entertain a Bill of this character, which represents, on the one hand, a singular invasion of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals and, on the other hand, the establishment of gross paraphernalia to police it, where the provisions are plainly in contrast to the genuine instinct of a democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also will make a start on restoring State <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said that, there is no need for me to go into details about the superannuation <span class="highlight">rights</span> that have been adequately touched upon by the honourable member for Moore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This may be very attractive to advocates of State <span class="highlight">rights</span> but it will appear anomalous and retrograde in the eyes of everbody concerned with the proper responsibility for public expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that we should have had produced the file of correspondence throughout the period of the High Court hearing between myself and  Mr Mensaros  the Minister for Mines of Western Australia, in which I repeatedly pointed out to him that State’s lack of sovereign powers, the inadequacy of the conditions in respect of which the State granted exploration permits or production <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the inadequacy of the expenditures that were sought from the companies concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further results flow from the High Court decisions, and I refer in this respect to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the on-shore States to legislate in respect of what is called peace, order and good government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government somehow wants to get around the situation and to give the respective States the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to continue to operate off-shore and to give title. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would not for one minute suggest in respect of Bass Strait, where there is competent development, that the companies should not be granted their full renewal of <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The original legislation was amended on 9 December 1974 to enable organisations which wished to do so to transfer their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to other eligible organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">rights</span> were sought by some organisations and this gave a considerable stimulus to the program and created a demand for grants in respect of hostels that exceeded the number that could be funded in 1975-76 within the Budget allocation of $40m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time these organisations were given an assurance by the previous Government that their <span class="highlight">rights</span> under the Aged Persons Hostels Act 1972-1974 would be preserved even though the making of grants in respect of their projects had been deferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has decided that, to enable an annual program of construction to be undertaken and to ensure that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of organisations which have acquired entitlements under the legislation are preserved, there should be an extension of the time within which the erection of a hostel can be commenced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An amendment to the existing legislation will give organisations with existing <span class="highlight">rights</span> 12 months from the date on which a grant is actually approved to plan and commence construction of their hostels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, the Labor Party has not been wont in the past or in the present to have any concern whatsoever for those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>True, the Act created important new <span class="highlight">rights</span> for citizens and corporations, but their practical importance is somewhat limited by traditional judicial views on the availability of discretionary remedies and by cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Notwithstanding that everyone is agreed that the High Court should be relieved of part of its existing original and appellate jurisdiction, that proposal has perished on the rock of State <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There must be a balance between the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the consumer to obtain the best and cheapest goods and the maintenance of the technological base in Australia and the employment of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With your concurrence,  Mr Speaker,  I want the Minister, by the time question time comes next Tuesday, to tell the House what steps he has taken to ensure that all candidates in this election are given equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> to canvass the voters who will be deciding the result of the election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It also does not include certain administrative expenses such as the provision of superannuation <span class="highlight">rights</span>, long service leave etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is time Australia, and this Government in particular, got moving in all the possible ways open to it, and stood for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people of East Timor to determine their own future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot accept the proposition that Australia’s relationship with the Indonesian people will be destroyed if we make a moral stand on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the East Timorese people for independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What can be so important about Australia’s relations with the Jakarta generals that we can ignore the gross violation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> on our very doorstep? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This position was in line with the general principles of the Labor Party on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people for self-determination and condemned the role of Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How hypocritical Australia will look in world forums for years to come, when we speak, as we have done in the past, of basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedom for peoples of the world to determine their own future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we believed that this matter was one of primary importance for Australia as a member of the region and as a government which was prepared to accept, as we do, the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the duties and the responsibilities towards our close neighbours, Indonesia and East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again let me draw attention to the very real difference between the policy of this Government and the policy of” the previous Government- a government which put so much store on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the United Nations, a government which believed so strongly, in words if not in deeds, that it was to the United Nations that the world was to look for better, more peaceful and more logical and reasoned solutions to problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are pressing for a recognition of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Timorese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Which  is  what this is all about- will give organisations with existing <span class="highlight">rights</span> 12 months from the date on which a grant is actually approved to plan and commence construction of their hostels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is the legislation we are debating now- will give organisations with existing <span class="highlight">rights</span> 12 months from the date on which a grant is actually approved to plan and commence construction of their hostels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The point is that the Minister said last Tuesday night that all those programs had been approved by our Government- that is by the Labor Governmenton 27 September last year and that the amendment will now give these <span class="highlight">rights</span> for only 12 months after the date of approval. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What <span class="highlight">rights</span> are available to persons required to remove clothing for the purpose of a search by Customs officials, and how are such <span class="highlight">rights</span> notified to the suspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>223 I gave certain details of the powers of officers, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of persons detained for search in accordance with the provisions of Section 196 of the Customs Act, and the procedures followed in relation to these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may not be known in the Parliament,  Sir, but  I am a great defender of civil <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a great defender of civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> I therefore must have regard for the feelings of my fellow man or fellow person, or whatever the appropriate expression may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and wrongs of the decision itself, namely the forcing of an election by the Head of State- I do not go into the constitutional details but I concede the point that that could well have been an inevitable outcomethere is no visible excuse for the way it was done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Australian parliamentary system is to be a modern working one, if it is to maintain the respect and the confidence of the ordinary people of Australia, the sooner the House of Representatives asserts its proper <span class="highlight">rights</span> about financial powers and about the dismissal of Ministers, the better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would add that any person who seeks to suggest that the Commonwealth Government will not protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all Australians is doing a great disservice to this Government, to this Parliament and to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that reason and common sense will prevail because if they do not and  Mr Dracup  ‘s <span class="highlight">rights</span> have to be protected, we could have a very serious situation on our hands in regard to the mail service in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One aspect of the new federalism which has made many local government observers uneasy is that the emphasis on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States could serve to confirm some of the centralist policies within individual States which have operated very much against the interests of local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs: Having regard to earlier statements made by the Minister on a timetable for the introduction of legislation to give effect to the granting of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Aborigines in the Northern Territory, can the Minister inform the House of the current situation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that the Government has authorised the introduction of legislation to recognise land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aborigines in the Northern Territory, those land <span class="highlight">rights</span> being in respect of the reserves there and also traditional lands to which Aborigines wish to make claim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fundamental provision recommended by  Mr Justice  Woodward- namely, to declare the nature of the Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to their own land- was omitted from the Bill introduced by the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will be making sure that their <span class="highlight">rights</span> are given to them in a legislative framework, with complementary legislation in the Northern Territory, in such areas as land use and the right of entry to Aboriginal land and communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Out of this cooperative effort between this Government and the Northern Territory we will have a piece of legislation giving land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Aborigines which will be able to last for a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a concern with which I have a great deal of sympathy and which should be shared by all members of this Parliament and all members of the Australian public who have a respect for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly, it was also proposed that citizens’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> should be linked with the performance of their civic duties- in other words, there were no civil <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although some minor liberalisation of citizens ‘ <span class="highlight">rights</span> and duties was achieved, the basic points- that is, the socialist character of the state, the role of the Polish United Workers Party and the country’s reliance on the Soviet Union for political support and defence- remain in force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The future of individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Poland is now quite clearly suspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the Attorney-General whether it is the intention to apply to laws relating to non-Aboriginal landholders in the Northern Territory similar national interest provisions as have been announced are to be contained in the Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation whereby the ownership of land and its usage can be over ridden in the national interest? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, in the opinion of this House, legislation should be introduced protecting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and standing of the Aboriginal people in the tribal lands affected by the Agreement, and providing for the recognition of traditional Aboriginal owners in the Aurukun area as those Aboriginal people who have common spiritual affiliations io a site on the land and who are entitled by Aboriginal tradition to forage as of right over that land; and providing for the recognition of traditions, observances, customs and beliefs as applied in relation to the people of Aboriginal race at Aurukun, and to sites and areas of land at Aurukun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be fair to say that Queensland follows the classic Australian pattern in acknowledging no Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>- I accept what is now happening, and has been happening for some time, in the Northern Territory- and regarding Aborigines in fact as a conquered people who may be dispossessed with impunity from what they regard as theirs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Aurukun has a Presbyterian mission and the board of the Presbyterian missions asked the Premier of Queensland ‘to withdraw the Bill pending consideration of it by the Aurukun community’ and ‘to ensure that the negotiated <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people are safeguarded’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I noted this when I was a member of the select committees on the grievances of Yirrkala Aborigines and the voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I was a member of the Select Committee on aboriginal voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>, our committee came down the Queensland coast taking evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We all, including  Mr Bjelke-Petersen,  have humbly to learn how to deal with Aborigines and we might begin by listening to them, acknowledging land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and treating them unsentimentally and with dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is a depressing sameness about what is going to happen here because the intervention of State <span class="highlight">rights</span> and all the rest of it prevents us from acting so effectively in northern Queensland unless we choose to take the necessary action to use the power conferred upon us at the referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that last night the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs issued a statement about the acceptance of the general principles of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The referendum in 1967- that is not very long ago- gave a clear mandate to this Parliament that when such issues are at stake the Australian Government must act regardless of any views of federalism, State <span class="highlight">rights</span> or anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people transcend anything else in this arena. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today we are talking about the betrayal by the Queensland Government of the general consensus that has developed in this Parliament and throughout the community concerning the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people and their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not without coincidence that it has become a byword at the same time as the question of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> has been raised again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is what has guided the Government in respect of its agreement to introduce land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite sure that my announcement in the House yesterday of the Government’s decision to introduce legislation in this Parliament for the giving of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Northern Territory will be a watershed in Australian history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know we have a long way to go because community understanding of what is involved in land <span class="highlight">rights</span> still leaves much to be desired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why it is a matter of high priority for my Government that not only must things like land <span class="highlight">rights</span> be recognised; programs for bicultural understanding must also be implemented, reach a high level and pervade every section of the community from the children to the elderly, because only when the Australian people understand Aborigines, their traditions, their culture, their spiritual affinity with land, can they understand what is involved in the granting of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and why. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation is vital if we are going to get anywhere in trying to make sure that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of ordinary people are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that it is a proper provision which will safeguard the civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> of occupiers of premises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a provision which protects the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people to that extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have come far beyond the point where anyone can pretend that the denial of <span class="highlight">rights</span> to minorities, or of basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> to majorities, is not a matter of international concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By all means let us take sides if the principles are clear, if humanitarian <span class="highlight">rights</span> are at stake, if our own interests or security are involved; but not when the facts are flimsy and disputed and more is to be lost than gained from intervention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this sort of area it is not a question of States <span class="highlight">rights</span> or the new federalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Proceedings relating to property, for example, are not valid if they are related only to property and therefore we have to look at this matter from the point of view of the normal problems of a marriage or the normal problems that follow in a dispute between parties to a marriage about property <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This intention was given support by  Mr Justice  Woodward in the first report of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission in 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My concern is to restore to this House its <span class="highlight">rights</span>, indeed its constitutional duty under section S3 of the Constitution, to initiate changes in the taxation laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when we look at that in the context of overall expenditure cuts there is no doubting that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has done a sterling job- that is almost a pun because the honourable member represents the seat of Stirling in Western Australia- in ensuring that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and aspirations of the Aboriginal people are, as far as possible, met in the context of the current economic problems facing this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite this we hear condemnation of the Aboriginal legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least now, because of the Aboriginal legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> organisation, when an Aboriginal appears in court he is assured of getting just representation in the court and will not be charged with an offence of which they were not guilty, as used to happen time and again throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the statements that have been made already by me and by the Prime Minister concerning Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> indicate the commitment of this Government to significant reforms in Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the way I would hope that my ministry will demonstrate to the Aboriginal people, and beyond them to all Australians, as the way in which we must treat these people who are our equals as citizens; people who have the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> as you and I; people who deserve the same support as you and I, and because of their particular position in society people who must receive special treatment from Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, we realise that when a person builds on a rural property, after gaining the permission of the owner- the owner might be that person’s parents- to occupy that dwelling, that person has no actual legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> which will protect him in the long term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the House are emphasised by the resolution of session 1818 which directs that no clerk or officer of the House, or shorthand writer employed to take minutes of evidence before the House, or any committee thereof, shall give evidence elsewhere in respect of any proceedings or examination had at the bar, or before any committee of the House, without the special leave of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is given a limited discretion not to investigate complaints, on grounds related to, for instance, vexatiousness, lack of interest in a matter complained about, or other <span class="highlight">rights</span> of appeal to a tribunal or court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In February 1 973, the former Government appointed an Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commissioner,  Mr Justice  A. E. Woodward, to inquire into and report on ‘the appropriate means to recognise and establish the traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span> and interests of the Aborigines in and in relation to land, and to satisfy in other ways the reasonable aspirations of the Aborigines to <span class="highlight">rights</span> in or in relation to land’ in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Justice  Woodward presented his first report in July of that year and in it recommended that a northern and a central land council be established to consider the preliminary views he set down in that report, and to present to him, with expert legal advice, the views of the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory on their land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In essence, although the Commission did not fully endorse the submissions made by the land councils, the Aboriginal people accepted the scheme of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> proposed by the Commission and urged that legislative effect be given to it as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since my oppointment I have received numerous submissions on the proposed legislation and had many discussions with aborigines and others, including members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and representatives of other interested groups in the Territory, and I have carefully considered their submissions, the recommendations of the Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission and the terms of the legislation previously introduced to give effect to those recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not intended that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to be established by this legislation should be watered down but that out of public scrutiny and whatever amendments may be required the best practicable instrument for effectuating the Government’s purpose and Aboriginal aspirations will be arrived at. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is relevant to draw honourable members’ attention to a closely parallel proposal for the recognition of the land and sea <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Eskimo people of Canada which is now before the Government of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Though some of the Indian people of Canada, as of the United States of America, earlier had some recognition of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> in land through treaties, the Eskimo people, like the Aborigines of the Northern Territory, have had no legal recognition of their traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the domestic law of their country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the creation of these, Land Trusts will achieve the primary objective of any Land Trust scheme which is the vesting, under Australian law, of <span class="highlight">rights</span> corresponding with traditional Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span>, without risk that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> conferred are not sufficient to cover traditional Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot over-emphasise the importance of this last mentioned aspect of land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill deals with the recognition of traditional land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and it is proper that the traditional claims of all groups to land outside the reserves should be assessed by the Commissioner and dealt with according to the procedures laid down in the Bill rather than by the arbitrary decision of any government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Existing <span class="highlight">rights</span> in land will be fully protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This provision protects the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those holding leases on Aboriginal land, like the mining companies at Gove and Groote Eylandt and the mission at Hermannsburg, while ensuring that the title can pass into Aboriginal hands when the lease expires or when the holder negotiates its surrender and the issue of a new lease from the Land Trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main differences between this Bill and that presented last October by the previous Government are, briefly, that: We have clearly defined the nature of the Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> we are recognising by vesting title in trusts for the benefit of all those Aborigines with traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span> to use and occupy that land- 1 might add, a fundamental provision strangely missing in the Labor Government’s Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some people have watched with interesteven suspicion- the statements which have been made by the Government on its intentions to legislate for land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some have expressed surprise that a Liberal-Country Party government should have made the decision to grant land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Aborigines in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let there be no more surprise, because the Government’s proposals to recognise Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in legislation is one more expression of the Government’s commitment to liberal and progressive reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Securing land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Aborigines in the Northern Territory is a significant expression of this objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When this legislation is read with the Nothern Territory land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation that has been introduced into this Parliament, with the new proposal to hand back to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly the power to regulate sacred sites, and when the record of that Assembly is viewed by the Parliament, we will see why the Hope Committee of inquiry was so definite in recommending that this area be placed under Federal control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was the man who produced a nonsensical Bill about Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He gets up in this House and attacks the members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly- people who have been born in the Northern Territory, and who have worked in the Northern Territory and who would know far more than the whole of his former Department put together, about land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, Aboriginal sacred sites and Aboriginal law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There should be a definition which does not allow people who have never been to the Territory to go there and claim <span class="highlight">rights</span> from people who were born and bred there or who have lived there for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It could cause great strife among traditional Aborigines when the matter of sacred sites or traditional land <span class="highlight">rights</span> is dealt with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the meantime it is important that the union members involved should be aware of their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, in addition, members who are fined or disciplined under the union rules have <span class="highlight">rights</span> under section 140 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which provides, amongst other things, that rules of organisations shall not hinder members from observing the provisions of an award. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact that atrocities are taking place in other countries surely should not stop any of us, and, I hope, some honourable members in the future, taking up these questions of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in other countries, if our voices in the Australian Parliament mean anything at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of the International Commission of Jurists of May 1974 showed evidence of a massive and continuing violation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> which suggested a planned campaign of systematic liquidation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is part of private members ‘ <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government seeks to provide additional accommodation for members in that way, I submit that their <span class="highlight">rights</span> are in no way denied but enhanced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all those circumstances the Government does not see that private members’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> have in any way been denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaving that aside, in no way do I see it as denying private members their <span class="highlight">rights</span> that we now seek to move on to Government business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last night I talked more generally about this matter and referred to the fact that other legislation that is before the House, the Northern Territory land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation, will certainly weaken the power of the Commonwealth over sacred sites because it is intended to hand back to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly a prerogative over this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Constitution itself certainly gives us <span class="highlight">rights</span> to deal with marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As alluded to by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, it may not be within section 51 placita (xxi) and (xxii) of the Constitution which refer to marriage, divorce and matrimonial causes and, in relation thereto, parental <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the custody and guardianship of infants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore I can tell the honourable member for Hunter that people ‘s <span class="highlight">rights</span> are well and truly protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When honourable members opposite get up in this House and talk about civil liberties, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual and not being middle class they should think of the right of any man in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has consistently deplored denials of civil liberties and violations of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> wherever they have occurred, and it will continue to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is our earnest hope as a government that in the interests of peace, stability and, indeed, economic and social development in that country as well as in neighbouring countries this apparent campaign of brutality and repression will be checked and that the exercise of all basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be restored swiftly to all Ugandans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is the issue of the basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of trade unionists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said earlier that political strikes not only usurp the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities of individual trade union members, they also put democracy at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am gravely concerned at the way in which the extreme left wing of the trade union movement is increasingly denying rank and file trade union members their basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> as unionists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the employees stand up for their <span class="highlight">rights</span>, their insistence that this should not happen, they then have to suffer a scurrilous attack in this House by 2 people who would not even know what a trade union movement is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their recommendations will long be remembered as major reforms leading to the establishment of a practicable and workable system of supervision of government activities which can serve only to preserve and advance the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of the individual citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by repeating the substantial point which I made at the beginning, and that is that this proposal for a Commonwealth Ombudsman is a very forward step and one which can help to guarantee the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of the individual citizen in the continuing confrontation that the citizen has these days with government in all its ramifications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As one who has been and will continue to be directly involved in establishing the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of migrants, I find the present situation exasperating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will give a balance at the Federal level to those additional <span class="highlight">rights</span> which presently exist for citizens at the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I see the introduction of an ombudsman as a further link forged for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual and the citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It is important, as I have said, in this highly complex technological society that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals be seen to be protected from the bureaucracy which people often feel they are incapable of opposing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that under the existing Commonwealth superannuation provisions the estate of a deceased person has no <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the accrued long service leave payments as opposed to the situation of persons covered by private worker’s compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would ask the Minister concerned to look at the long service leave provisions covering Commonwealth employees to ensure that persons who have established <span class="highlight">rights</span> to benefits are entitled to have those <span class="highlight">rights</span> met whether or not the person survives to collect them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The functions of the Designated Authority under the Federal Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act in the granting of exploration or production <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the definition of areas, the payment and collection of royalties and other moneys and the conditions of drilling intensity are exclusively Commonwealth functions in the exercise of Commonwealth sovereignty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a time when some honourable members on the Government side of the chamber are making noises about participation by private members in parliamentary affairs, we have before us a motion that removes from private members one of the few <span class="highlight">rights</span> that they have to initiate business in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When a House starts to invoke in 1975, and carries into 1 976, powers that were discarded nearly 200 years ago in the Parliament on which we model ourselves I think it is time that this House asserted its <span class="highlight">rights</span> against the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But those are secondary areas, and if one talks to Aboriginal people one finds that the real thrust, particularly in the traditional areas, is in relation to land <span class="highlight">rights</span>- the relationship that Aboriginal people have to their land, identification with their land, and their wish to have access to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In all their pristine ignorance they have fondly believed that lieutenant-colonels would look after their <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but lieutenant-colonels generally have not looked after their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In answer to a question I placed on notice about unratified International Labour Organisation conventions, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations on the last sitting day told me that the Indigenous and Tribal Populations Convention, which is relevant to the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australian Aborigines, cannot yet be ratified by Australia because one State has not yet agreed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Governor-General, with no consideration for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the members of this chamber and with no consideration for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives, who, the honourable member for Mackellar has convinced us, is the champion of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this chamber, refused to see the  Speaker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I assure honourable members that there would not have been an Australian Parliament if the fathers of our Constitution had not agreed to a 2-House parliamentary system, with the second House ensuring that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the small States are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that the tribunal is headed by 3 highly competent people who determine the <span class="highlight">rights</span> not only of parliamentarians but also of academics and members of so many other sections of our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a modern society such as we like to pride ourselves to have, those things should be <span class="highlight">rights</span> that people are entitled to have simply because they are members of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question that I think that any government has to ask itself is just how far we go with these <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Maribyrnong  (Dr Cass)  made the very important point that in today’s society the Government and the community should be turning their attention to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the less privileged people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the community as a whole has accepted the fact that there is a great responsibility on all our shoulders to ensure that the less advantaged people in the community are given their <span class="highlight">rights</span> by both governments and the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The centre would be used, firstly, to inform people of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and to ensure that they are protected; secondly, to provide ways in which unemployed can be meaningfully involved in using their skills, irrespective of whether the inter-industry market requires them; thirdly, to act as a local pressure group on the labour market; and fourthly, to encourage the unemployed to be involved in implementing these aims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A despondency has settled over some of these Aboriginal communities as a result of the curtailment of funds and also because of the undermining of the most important matter concerning Aboriginal people, land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant),  who will be speaking next in the debate, led the van in demanding that Aborigines have grog <span class="highlight">rights</span> when he was the  Deputy Chairman  of the parliamentary committee concerned with Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grog <span class="highlight">rights</span> were mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was a member of the select committee which inquired into Aboriginal voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>, one expert after another from the Attorney-General’s Department in Darwin or anywhere else said: ‘You cannot devise a tribal title’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the report on voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aborigines was being debated in this chamber I did not believe that the first thing that should happen to Aborigines was that drinking <span class="highlight">rights</span> should be extended to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first <span class="highlight">rights</span> which they were given by the Commonwealth and the States were fornication <span class="highlight">rights</span>, so that it was no longer a crime for a white man to cohabit with an Aboriginal woman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then they were given drinking <span class="highlight">rights</span> and voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been reflected in the deliberate theft of people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the sell-out of their shares in Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the allocation of mining <span class="highlight">rights</span> is made by the State, as he knows, and not by the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If democracy is whittled away the door will be open for the manipulation of criminal proceedings by the bureaucracy whose regard for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual and the rule of law may, by the mere development of that bureaucratic system, end up being less than that which we have today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, that estimate of 95 000 includes a claimed estimate of 85 000 by the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How much more suffering has to be undergone by a people in order to make the Fraser Government listen and to stand up for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a people so near our shores to self-determination free from interference? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The grim tragedy of Timor constitutes a denial of basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> as well as a brutal act of annexation of the type carried out by Hitler when he seized Czechoslovakia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that even the honourable member who interjects would place the demands of humanity, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people to freedom and liberty above any questions of the legality of one radio set. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not prepared to recommend discriminatory treatment about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginal people to drink. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another point is that while I was the Minister for the Capital Territory I perforce had to come to an agreement with the local authorities about legislation concerning the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to sell liquor during 24-hours a day in Canberra, for which I found myself assailed on television some weeks ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue originally was not alcohol but the fundamental question of freedom, of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and of equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> for everybody in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a forum within which everybody’s sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet it is to change those sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> that I see some of the consequences flowing from this amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would take away the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual States to determine the way in which persons from those States are to go on to the Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister’s emphasis on State <span class="highlight">rights</span> in subsidising the arts- what he is pleased to call devolution’- is the purest example of Liberal ideology taking precedence over good sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another cause for concern with the arts under this Government is the abolition of the Australian authors fund and a totally inadequate Budget allocation this year of less than $700,000 for the public lending <span class="highlight">rights</span> scheme, the rates for which were set in 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone concerned with an equitable distribution of income from the publication of original Australian fiction, prose and poetry must wonder who will look after public lending <span class="highlight">rights</span> and what sort of budget will be made available for this very worthy form of arts assistance in the Budget allocation for 1977-78. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With no one to speak up for it and only the Prime Minister’s word that adequate funding of the scheme will continue, the public lending <span class="highlight">rights</span> grants to authors and publishers may soon wither and die. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not expect these administrative arrangements to be in any way prejudicial to or have any adverse effect on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of authors under the public lending right scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By giving transit <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the New Zealand rugby union team the Fraser Government deliberately condoned sporting contacts with South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any person in public life acts improperly in respect of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of nations or the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people, sooner or later he is brought to book. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would simply make the point that whatever the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and wrongs of Australia ‘s participation in the Vietnam war- and that can be argued at great length in this Parliament- I believe that no one in this Parliament should argue that Australia does not have a great moral responsibility to take additional numbers of these people from their refugee camps in Thailand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therein lies danger, not only for innocent people ‘s <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but for democracy itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps best of all, the expression of his attitude to freedom and his attitude to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and wrongs of society appears in a paper he delivered on the role of dissent in a free society, again in September 1971 when, as Attorney-General for the Commonwealth, he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The exercise of the power to dissent should never be allowed where it operates to deny the equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen many examples of the way in which he stood for his principles and the way in which, despite his public image, in a private sense he pursued the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things we did together was to write a paper on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of witnesses before parliamentary committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was an appropriate document for Ivor Greenwood to share in because in it much will be found about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand there may be a point- this is the matter I have been concerned with- that under the guise of religious freedom and the exercise of religious <span class="highlight">rights</span> young people are subjected to all sorts of things that brainwash and indoctrinate them in a way that is an intrusion into human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Would the Minister encourage union members to look to their legal <span class="highlight">rights</span>  vis a vis  extremist union leadership? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason, I support the thrust of this Government’s policy to implement its welfare programs according to a ‘needs’ rather than a ‘<span class="highlight">rights</span>’ basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bases of this Government’s policies are our rejection of the use of force as a proper means of solving international problems; our belief in the democratic process and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people to determine their own institutions; and our deep concern for the welfare of the underprivileged anywhere in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I did not think it was in the best interests of either airline at this time for us to agree that landing <span class="highlight">rights</span> ought to be extended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, honourable members on this side of the House- the members of the Australian Labor Party- resisted that valiantly and fought for the rest of the day to preserve the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of private members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill protects the long service leave <span class="highlight">rights</span> of persons who were in public employment in Papua New Guinea prior to independence, who worked for the independent state of Papua New Guinea after independence and who then entered, or in the future will enter, Commonwealth employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The intention is to confer jurisdiction on the Court in matters which, if they arose in isolation, might not be matters of federal jurisdiction but which, arising in association with a matter of federal jurisdiction, must be disposed of at the same time as that matter in order that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the parties may be finally determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the important features of the agreement was that it took account of the interests and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all the parties involved, contrary to what the Minister now would have us believe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This amending legislation to the Income Tax Laws Amendment (Royalty) Act in fact exempts from retrospectivity, as I understand it, taxpayers whose assessments have been issued before the date of the announcement of the clarifying legislation and who have thereby acquired <span class="highlight">rights</span> of objection and appeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now that  Mr David  Hay’s report concerning the proposed amendments to the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill, for which the Minister gave the second reading on 4 June last, has now been received, will the Minister table it so that members of the House and the Australian public can examine  Mr Hay’s  recommendations prior to the debate on the Bill being resumed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While we understand that the High Court has its <span class="highlight">rights</span> as well, we also applaud the fact that Nauruan independence is in no way affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That Court consists at the moment of a single chief justice and obviously it is important to the Nauruans to ensure that there are <span class="highlight">rights</span> of access to the appellate court sitting as a full court in matters that are not of special or peculiar interest to Nauruans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was a select committee to inquire into Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bill will safeguard the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of existing officers and employees who are transferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-45-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These provisions are designed to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> without inhibiting by legislation the ability of the Northern Territory Public Service Commissioner in his actions in relation to the newly formed Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-45-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed that promotion and appeal <span class="highlight">rights</span> of existing officers will be continued in substantively the same manner as was provided for staff transferred to the Postal and Telecommunications Commissions and a regulation making power for this purpose is included in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-45-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will ensure, through legislation such as this Bill and the new Northern Territory Public Service Ordinance, that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of officers who enter that Service are fully protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-45-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Wilmot  (Mr Bun)  made the point that the collegiate system in some way protects the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members in small States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The collegiate system does not preserve the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the smaller States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as some State Premiers have criticised the local government legislation as being centralist, they fail to understand that it is legislation to determine the <span class="highlight">rights</span> between spheres of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we ignore the Prime Minister’s ideological rantings about centralism, big government and State <span class="highlight">rights</span>, there are 2 central questions to be asked about these Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>No less ardent a defender of States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> than the Premier of Queensland said on 8 April: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of staff affected will be protected and there will be consultations with the Public Service Board and the staff associations concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Indonesian Government would permit such a service if certain reciprocal <span class="highlight">rights</span> were granted to it in relation to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret to say that these reciprocal <span class="highlight">rights</span> involve much more than just a simple service from Bali to the honourable member’s electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the owner of the vehicle? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could see a situation where the owner is paying for a vehicle that has been disposed of by the Department and he is precluded from having any <span class="highlight">rights</span> in respect of the vehicle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that the owner does not have any <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Generally the two new matters of importance are the conferring upon Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General of a new power in constitutional cases in any court of intervention in the suits of private parties, and provisions conferring new <span class="highlight">rights</span> on legal practitioners of one State to appear m courts of other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However because of problems with our overseas airline agreement and the request by the Indonesian airline for reciprocal <span class="highlight">rights</span>, it has been decided to allow only Qantas Airways Ltd to implement the service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen many contributions to that debate and to what Australians might have to discuss in the future and about which parts of the Constitution may have to be amended to safeguard the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With respect to the new <span class="highlight">rights</span> of legal practitioners, clause 8 of the Judiciary Amendment Bill proposes the insertion of a new section to confer a new right on legal practitioners who are now entitled to practise in Federal courts to practise in any court of any State in a case where that court is exercising Federal jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe there is an accent in our law towards the protection of proprietary <span class="highlight">rights</span> as against the protection of personal <span class="highlight">rights</span> that has historically been to the detriment of our legal process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But many people historically have reflected upon and criticised our law for too great attention being given to the protection of property <span class="highlight">rights</span> as against personal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again we are restricting the right of appeal in cases of personal <span class="highlight">rights</span> as against those of property <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why go this further extent and only restrict it to death or personal injury in cases where the individual’s personal <span class="highlight">rights</span> have been affected? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe again that we are perpetuating an accent in the law upon property <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as I have said a number of times, the Bill fails to take the opportunity to ennunciate to the nation at large that this Government and the law are based upon concern for both property and personal <span class="highlight">rights</span>, not property <span class="highlight">rights</span> to a greater extent than personal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, there is the tendency- albeit in accordance with legal principle- in some cases to treat matters relating to the criminal law as being in a slightly different category from those relating to proprietary <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, 1 1 November marks the day on which payment in fact will be made automatically and without reference to Parliament, so that there can be no political intereference with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of pensioners to receive adjustments in accordance with rises in the cost of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Primary Industry aware that negotiations have been going on for many years for the introduction of legislation to grant patent <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the breeders of plants, which are commonly known as plant breeders’ <span class="highlight">rights</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He may not be aware that, unfortunately, within the States there is some considerable opposition to the proposition for the introduction of legislaton to protect plant breeders’ <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of course, as now interpreted, quite essential that there be complementary legislation if the plant breeders’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> are to be effectively implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I am told that if we were able to establish plant breeders’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> we might well be able to introduce new varieties from overseas which might further develop the agricultural potential of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every citizen has <span class="highlight">rights</span> and every State has duties rather than <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As governors and governments they have no <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People who talk about State <span class="highlight">rights</span> are incipient fascists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the fact is that to talk about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of governments is to deny what we are here about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Jat- Jugoslav Airlines has had <span class="highlight">rights</span> to fly into Melbourne and has never taken up its option. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since entering this Parliament I have received complaints on many occasions from water users downstream about a claim that too many water <span class="highlight">rights</span> are given upstream and that this slows down the rate of flow of a river and often increases the pollution and salinity level of the water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that anyone could deny that laws and regulations that determine the <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the use of water can be the means of distributing rural prosperity often to the advantage of those property holders upstream and to the disadvantage of those downstream. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several times both inside and outside this Parliament the Prime Minister has stated that it is the firm objective of the Government to arrive at a settlement which will protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and interests of the Islanders and preserve their traditional way of life and livelihood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Minister for Primary Industry has announced that the Government will take into account Japan’s reduction in beef imports from Australia when it considers the renewal of Japan’s fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Australian waters, I ask him whether there are any arrangements between Australia and Canada, the United States of America, the European Economic Community and Great Britain which could also be reviewed in the same way, in view of the unilateral decisions on minimal notice which those customers have also imposed by way of quotas or even bans on their imports of Australian beef? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps out of the Law of the Sea conference, which will deal with the question of the extension to 200 miles of Australia’s fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span>, similar circumstances might arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In negotiating access <span class="highlight">rights</span> and fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span> we will have in mind what sort of an opportunity should be given initially to Australian fishermen and also to other sectors of the Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would not then have the reverse situation which had prevailed for so long under which they had no <span class="highlight">rights</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people should have their own entitlements, <span class="highlight">rights</span> and standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two of the 3 Bills are of the utmost significance- especially the Aborginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill, which only today was the subject of some 42 Government amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event, he should separate the debates so that the significance of the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Bill and the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill might be fully understood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall that, when the former Administration introduced its land <span class="highlight">rights</span> Bill and councils and associations Bill, it sought to have a joint debate, which was proceeding at the time of the dissolution of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arrangements have been made between the Leader of the House  (Mr Sinclair)  and his opposite number on the Opposition side that the debate on the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill should proceed to the Committee stage and that then the debate should be adjourned until the resumption of the sitting of the House the week after next. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also worthwhile noting that the representations received have come from all parts of Australia- a clear indication of the depth and spread of public interest in Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To further ensure that the Aborigines with traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span> in land guide the action of land councils, an amendment will provide that a land council should express the wishes as well as the opinions of Aborigines in its area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I indicated in introducing the Bill, it is the Government’s intention, as it was  Mr Justice  Woodward’s recommendation, that existing <span class="highlight">rights</span> in land should be fully protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where application for mineral leases on land which becomes Aboriginal land under the Act or by a successful claim on traditional grounds to unalienated Crown land had been lodged previously to 4 June, being the date of introduction of the Bill, but not granted as a result of a freeze imposed in December 1972 pending decisions on land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the grant of a further mining interest will not be subject to consent but the applicant companies will still be obliged to negotiate fair terms in accordance with the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his report he envisaged that consent would be negotiated normally at the stage when exploration <span class="highlight">rights</span> were applied for and that the right to develop any minerals or petroleum discovered should be subject only to the adequacy of the notice given of development intentions and the final negotiation of fair terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now intended to spell out in the Bill, however, guidelines stipulating the kind of laws which should be made by the Legislative Assembly, and to guarantee recognition in those laws of traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, an offence will be written into the Bill for unlawful entry onto a sacred site; Ordinances dealing with sacred sites will have to protect traditional interests in accordance with Aboriginal wishes; traditional Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> to enter Aboriginal land must be provided for; protection or conservation of wildlife in the Northern Territory, including wildlife on Aboriginal land, must operate through schemes of management formulated in consultation with Aboriginals and the right of Aboriginals to utilise wildlife resources; and Ordinances regulating entry to seas adjacent to Aboriginal land to a distance of 2 kilometres must provide for the right of Aboriginals to enter and use the resources of those waters in accordance with Aboriginal tradition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said before that I believe that the passage of legislation to grant land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Aboriginals in the Northern Territory will be a most significant and progressive step in the social and political history of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am confident that the Parliament will give the Bill the attention it deserves and will find that the amendments I have here outlined briefly will strengthen the essential provisions of the Bill while guaranteeing proper protection of existing statutory and other <span class="highlight">rights</span> as recommended by  Mr Justice  Woodward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The events of the last minute or two have shown the very exceptional circumstances that apply to the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill, as has been indicated by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner),  is unusually complex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will have to content myself with making some remarks about the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The establishment of the Woodward Royal Commission and the consequent introduction in 1975 of the Aboriginal Land (Northern Territory) Bill was a direct result of the 1972 commitment by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  that a Labor Government would legislate to give Aboriginals land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, ‘not just because their case is beyond argument, but because all of us as Australians are demeaned while the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That pledge came after 23 years of neglect of the Aboriginal people by the Liberal-Country Party coalition and in particular their outspoken claims for land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hoped that the Government will see fit to accept these amendments in the spirit in which they will be movedthat of representing to the people and, in particular, the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory a bipartisan policy on land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, let me take as my starting point the claim made in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in the case of Millirrpum v. Nabalco and the Commonwealth in 1968, which is known as the Gove land <span class="highlight">rights</span> case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interim report of the commission established to investigate how land <span class="highlight">rights</span> could be granted statutorily,  Mr Justice  Woodward, who was a counsel in the Gove land <span class="highlight">rights</span> case, pointed out that the Aboriginal concepts related to land owning have no parallel in European law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek leave to have incorporated in  Hansard  an extract from the first report of  Mr Justice  Woodward on Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, entitled  Aborigines and Their Land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommendations of the second and final report of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission which was presented by  Mr Justice  Woodward formed the basis of the Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill that was introduced into the Parliament 13 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition opposes this transfer of power and, in particular, opposes the deletion of that clause of the 1975 Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill which provided that this Parliament, through regulation, could override any Northern Territory legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet another important omission from this legislation is that provision of the 1975 Act which extended Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> 2 kilometres into the sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This omission has upset a large number of Aboriginal communities as it offers them no protection of their fishing and religious <span class="highlight">rights</span> off their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, might I add one additional matter which has relevance to the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation and also to the States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Bill, that is, the matter of a treaty of commitment between the Australian Government and the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They represent the considered opinions of persons who have been concerned with the Aboriginal cause, and in particular with Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, for a number of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill may have aroused widespread debate and interest amongst the Australian community in the past 5 months but it certainly did not arouse a very widespread sense of understanding or interest amongst members of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that in the 1950s and 1960s and in the early 1970s attitudes in Australia towards land and towards Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> for land had a way of being quickly ventilated in the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course there is an exquisite difficulty and that difficulty is in representing 2 cultures and in synchronising the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those 2 cultures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe clause 70 of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill seeks to do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A recognition of legitimate <span class="highlight">rights</span> to land, not by European tradition but by Aboriginal tradition, are enshrined in this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final paragraph of this Press statement states: -If Calder and Kilgariff have any courage then their campaign on behalf of rnining and pastoral interests will cause them to vote against the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 10 minutes that are available to me I shall consider the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I suggest that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in accordance with clause 20 of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill 1976, should divide the Northern Territory into at least 2 areas and establish Aboriginal land councils for each area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Northern Territory is moving towards Statehood and it would be ludicrous to deny the Territory legitimate <span class="highlight">rights</span> of legislation in areas which, it is understood, would be controlled by the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can determine the adequacy of the clauses contained in the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill relating to the identification of the traditional owners of land and the means of establishing the views of such owners to the satisfaction of the relevant land council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose it is something when a Queensland member talks semi-favourably about land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We just would not trust it politically with anything to do with human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, particularly Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition does not hate the miners but we know full well that the mining industry has to be brought under very close scrutiny and control, particularly where human <span class="highlight">rights</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two of the Bills before the House, the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Bill and the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill are of a fundamental importance to the Aboriginal people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognise the fact that the delay in the introduction of the legislation concerning councils is no reflection on anybody; neither do I lay too many charges of undue delay in respect of the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation as I recognise the great difficulty that is involved in drafting such legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is deeply involved in the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> question and, I have no doubt, in the whole operation of Aboriginal advancement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What that meant was that this Parliament has no right whatsoever to abdicate its responsibility in respect of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and hand any control, any possibility of interference, over to any State government or particularly to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I hear my friend the honourable member for Lilley almost spraining his elbows and bis arms to pat himself and the Government on the back in this matter I am reminded of the long history of colonial peoples in the world and the efforts of people, even such strange people and nondemocrats as George III, to try to ensure that people should get their proper <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 19 February 1836 the following direction was issued in respect of South Australia provided always that nothing in these our Letters Patent contained shall affect or be construed to affect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of any Aboriginal Natives of the said Province to the actual occupation or enjoyment of their own persons … of any lands . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why, for my own purpose, I would say in this instance that we should give no consideration to anybody else’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>, whether national or otherwise, to go and mine land at all, until the Aboriginal people can handle the impact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to do something to protect them against the possibility of being persuaded into getting rid of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the time being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In matters of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the advancement of the Aboriginal people, particularly the protection of this fundamental principle, this Parliament must accept the full responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 20-odd years since I first became involved in Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> we have had lots of discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been associated with Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> from the very beginning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He relied upon a quotation from the Woodward report to denigrate the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of traditional owners and to say that in some way the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and claims of people who had moved away from their traditional lands- very often people who may be only of part Aboriginal blood and living in fringe areas- were somehow more important and more significant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He deals with the land holding corporations, which should be called land trusts, and says that they should hold land for the benefit of all those having traditional interests in or <span class="highlight">rights</span> over it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before the suspension of the sitting I was addressing some remarks to one of the 3 Bills being debated cognately, the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say in response to the remarks by honourable members opposite that history will record that it was the Liberal and National Country Parties which pursued and brought to finality land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aborigines, that it was a government of our persuasion which commissioned the Woodward report, and that it is a government of our persuasion which brought in this legislation that was enacted into law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that these are the parties which brought in the initial report upon which this legislation is based, and these are the parties which will have carried into the law of the land Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and that ought to be remembered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole commitment which is embodied in the 3 Bills that we are debating- the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Bill, the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill and the States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Bill- is designed to advantage Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my Party’s policy statement a clear commitment was given to Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and those who endeavour to say that we lack that commitment need only look at the document. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is much the same with land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The spiritual connection between a clan and its land involves both <span class="highlight">rights</span> and duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> are to the unrestricted use of its natural products; the duties are . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They make clear the importance of traditional owners in the structure of these Bills, the importance of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Aborigines and the importance of giving them a purpose in life and an understanding of living and achieving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to comment on a number of points in relation to clauses in the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  has mentioned an amendment which will give those traditional owners <span class="highlight">rights</span> in relation to that land that they may not have enjoyed before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, if one looks at clause 67 one will see that it speaks of the traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span> to use or occupy Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sort of examination would only delay further the opportunity for us to be able to give land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to concentrate on the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Labor Government introduced last year a Bill along similar lines concerning land <span class="highlight">rights</span>- I feel it went a lot further- this BUI will have far-reaching effects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been claimed that in the early days of the settlement of the Eyre Peninsula, which is in my electorate, when the Aboriginal people were defending their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and standing up to the settlers, the settlers had a big drive on horseback and drove a large group of Aborigines towards the cliffs and forced them over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, with the dispossession that had taken place, the matter of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aborigines became of great importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That decision was based on white man’s law and in it the traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people were completely ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a decision made within the very limited framework in which he had to work- the European law, the white man’s law, under which the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aborigines were given short shrift. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Emphasis was given at that time to the need for a law to cover this aspect of Aboriginal life; that is, a law to establish land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think everybody recognised the need for this land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the establishment of the Woodward Commission and the presentation of its report in about 1973, the Labor Government in 1975 introduced its land <span class="highlight">rights</span> Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Woodward report recommended that the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation ‘should be protected in such a way that its provisions cannot be eroded by the effect of any Northern Territory legislation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The removal of all powers to pass Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Legislation which the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly has been granted . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The restoration of all powers vested in Land Councils and the Land Commissioner in the Labor Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had correspondence from the Central Lands Council and from the Aboriginal legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> organisation in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall deal with only one, namely, the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We might ask: What is this land <span class="highlight">rights</span> Bill? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is about traditional Aborigines and about maintaining their <span class="highlight">rights</span> over traditional land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would Uke to have seen the Aborigines in the reserves having full mining <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but I would not Uke to have seen them with the ability to barter those <span class="highlight">rights</span> away in such a fashion as to bring in intensive industries and destroy their communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill deals with traditional land and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of traditional Aboriginals are worth protecting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One point I mention for the record is that the Labor Government was in fact the Government which took the initiative to set up the commission to investigate matters related to the campaign for Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a letter to the  Bulletin  dated 20 November 1976 and headed ‘Land <span class="highlight">rights</span> hangup’  Mr Eames  had this to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pastor Paul Albrecht and his missionary colleagues,  Mr Stoll  and  Mr Ziersch,  base their opposition to Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> … on misconceptions and misreadings both of the legislation which has been proposed and the response to it by Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The powerful vested interest groups which also oppose land <span class="highlight">rights</span> have, however, adopted Albrecht ‘s opinion with great enthusiasm and considerable relief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Anderson  suggests that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  should not arbitrate and decide on any matter as important as Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and claims without thorough reference and consultation with Aboriginal leaders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Invoilable legislation setting aside our land and sacred <span class="highlight">rights</span> in certain areas (regardless of whether such land is currently occupied by our people). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I do, I would like to say how sad I am to see the present Government departing so far from the principles and sound practice of the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> Bill introduced by the Whitlam Government into this House in October 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will be aware that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly wished to control all land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does it not listen to the Aboriginal people who know their land <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be summarily dealt with by the NTLA, and who are outraged by what they see to be the Federal Government’s betrayal of their interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I wish to discuss briefly the issue of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> to hunt protected wildlife in Aboriginal lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would Uke to go on and talk about the anti-social greed of the grasping mining com- panies whose record in relation to Aboriginal and <span class="highlight">rights</span> is a shabby one indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the introduction of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aborigines in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that a real effort has been made by this Parliament to find the right solution on land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, so that the traditional owners may control their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All Aborigines welcomed land <span class="highlight">rights</span>; but they did not understand in the first place the land councils as envisaged in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hence the very real danger is that the setting up of a council or advisory group to decide land <span class="highlight">rights</span> will bring bloodshed and decimation of Aborigines here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Kutungula (manager) for that land will say, ‘This man (irrpalterama) is trying to usurp our <span class="highlight">rights</span>; you go and kill him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This law here (pointing to Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill) that’s white man’s law; what this is saying, that’s theirs! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Indicating the Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the method of voting they picked up ideas and turned them into this (Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is my thought and the other Aboriginal men stop we are not satisfied land trusts go to anyone I am land trust myself according to my law stop Please we want you to come to us on Thursday to talk about this matter stop We want to see you come and talk with us stop  Mr Eli  Rubuntja and we other men stop We are leaders of Aboriginal people stop We want to see our land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in our own land stop <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am speaking like this only to try to get through to the Government that when the proposed committee has been formed it will have to look very carefully, as has been mentioned by the Minister, at the operation of the lands <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation and give consideration to the complementary legislation being passed by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other representatives were therefore summoned so that the meeting became a Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can only be impressed by the strength of their convictions that the Bill does not satisfactorily achieve land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and’ that it will cause serious friction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 assure the honourable member for the Northern Territory that when the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill was brought in we did not know that the Senate was going to withhold consent for Supply and that the Governor-General was going to dismiss us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select Committee on Aboriginal Voting <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, which was set up by a Liberal government, that we were proceeding down the coast of Queensland and representatives of various organisations came before us to give evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The land <span class="highlight">rights</span> question on the whole brings to us the authentic voice of Aborigines because the people with a claim to land in reality tend to be authentically Aboriginal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tragedy of valid action on the question of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> is that the States of Western Australia and Queensland are not taking the fundamental action that they should be taking and action on this question is virtually confined to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also say that we consider Arnhem land belongs to Yolngu people and we must retain <span class="highlight">rights</span> to restrict entry and this should be written into this Bill, If it is not and the permit system comes under the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly Legislation then the Administrator of the Permit system must ask the Yolngu (traditional owners) before he says yes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill 1976, which was introduced on 4 June 1976, be considered for early passage through the Parliament <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Rights</span> of Aborigines to enter on pastoral leases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all cases I have found the land owners anxious to preserve their property <span class="highlight">rights</span> and in Western Australia, at least, the law effectively enabled them to do it when the land was in  bona fide  and regular use as a farm or grazing property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that was an extremely sensible statement by  Senator Chaney  pointing out that it is not unknown in Australia for land owners to have <span class="highlight">rights</span> as against mining companies and therefore there was nothing outrageous in the proposal that they should have some authority over the land which will be declared to be theirs when they are confronted by a mining interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for the Northern Territory must know that a Bill such as this, if it is supported widely in the Northern Territory, represents an immense movement of opinion in the Northern Territory compared with what existed in August 1 952 when I made a land <span class="highlight">rights</span> speech in this House- so far as I know it was the first one- and the whole speech was regarded as rather ridiculous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After consultations between both sides, as is the courtesy of the House, it was agreed that the Committee stage of the debate on the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill would be stood over until the first week of sitting after the recess next week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bill entrenches in Australian domestic law for the first time the customary <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines according to their traditional interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that what  His  Honour  Mr Justice  Woodward has provided in his report and what is reflected in this legislation will do all that is required to provide for the traditional ownership <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was pointed out that there could be a conjunction of Aboriginal interest and Australian domestic legal interest through the identity of the Aboriginal who is the custodian and who might also be the trustee for the Aborigines of their land <span class="highlight">rights</span> through membership of the land trust I feel that whatever might be said about the material provided to the House by the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  from those Aborigines around Hermannsburg, there will not be the friction they fear when this legislation is put into operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was proposed to  Mr Justice  Woodward that Aborigines should also have the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to minerals within their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may well be reasonable for such matters to be reported to the Minister and for somebody to keep an eye on the system to make sure that no civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> are transgressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am one of the people who, in some ways, has doubts about absolute <span class="highlight">rights</span> being vested in municipalities, particularly concerning personal, freedoms and things of that nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I grant the necessity for people to be protected against infringement on their civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> in situations such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Among other changes provided for in the Bill are: Firstly, the circumstances in which remedies are available to minority interests are widened and extended to debenture holders; secondly, a share in a company which is held in trust for that company will not carry voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>; thirdly, a company will be required to keep a register of options to acquire securities in a company; fourthly, a company will be required to keep a register which will enable a check to be made on multiple directorships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the Government’s recognition of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States, however, legislation regarding off-shore industry vessels and collision regulations has been excluded from this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over centuries we have designed the way in which parliamentary business should be handled, particularly matters which determine people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms, so I do not think that we ought to do this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want now to mention very briefly the inadequacy of any mention of political <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the conditions of service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know that there is considerable opposition, particularly in the bureaucracy, to liberalising the political <span class="highlight">rights</span> of servicemen, but now that they have been liberalised for public servants they should be liberalised to the same degree for servicemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Tonight I welcome the opportunity to raise with the Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen),  who with characteristic courtesy is in the House as a result of my advising him that I would raise these matters, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of serving members of the defence forces to participate in political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Very shortly, my request to the Minister is: Can he give some sort of an indication as to the position and his thinking about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of serving members of the armed Services to have membership and participate actively in political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government had, additionally, announced that there was still another $500m of International Monetary Fund unconditional drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> available to the Government- making a total of $ 1,000m- and if the Government had done that some time ago in the firmest terms it just may have been possible to stave off the problem which has arisen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-23-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Party has joined with many concerned groups in the community- trade unions, Aboriginal people, church groups, women’s groups, environmentalists and groups of citizens concerned with the preservation of democractic <span class="highlight">rights</span>- in condemning the haste of the Government in making its 11 November statement, its disregard of the final recommendation of the Fox report and its general stance on the issue of uranium mining development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government, by its actions and its statement made ironically on 1 1 November of this year, has tried to ignore both the Fox report and the people ‘s <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should recognise the legitimate demands and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Deductions available for capital expenditure on the development of a mine or oil field, on the provision of community facilities adjacent to a mine or field, or on the purchase of mining <span class="highlight">rights</span> or information, that currently are allowable over the estimated life of the mine or field will, for new expenditures, be allowable on reducing balances, by reference to a maximum life of 5 years instead of 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In paragraph 109 of the second report of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission, under the heading ‘Control of access to Aboriginal land’, he stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his statement on 17 November 1976 he said that traditional Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> to enter Aboriginal lands must be provided for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it that we must wait now after 13 years or more since the first shots were fired on land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for the Northern Territory will forgive us if, on this side of the Committee, we have a reasonable suspicion that the National Country Party is not all that dedicated to the principle of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has always acted as though the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginal people could be transcended, for instance, by miners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, for the time being, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals to go on to Aboriginal land are already restricted and the exercise of those <span class="highlight">rights</span> is capable of being restricted by the operation of that ordinance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My friend the honourable member forthe Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  pointed out the error of the continuing proposition of the honourable member for Hughes that it will be the Legislative Assembly which administers the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of entry to Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Ordinance will continue to operate until such time as it is superseded by a law of the Northern Territory which is passed in accordance with the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act and which is acceptable to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But inevitably it will happen if we allow the part-bloods and those full-bloods who have no traditional ties but who may be a little on the smart side to come in and usurp by their superior skills in committees, by their superior command of the European language, and by their superior knowledge of European law, or whatever it may be, the real <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the traditional Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that people may be able to go to these Aboriginal areas and talk themselves into <span class="highlight">rights</span> to which they are not entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we cannot get that definition accepted this time perhaps it could be looked at by the proposed committee which will oversee the implementation of this legislation in respect of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the traditional owners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of its importance for maintaining for traditional Aborigines the traditional land and traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span> which this Bill describes in its title, I ask that the amendment be seriously considered, if not here at least in another place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that in other clauses of this BUI there are many guarantees as to the negotiating <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines through the land councils and the deed-holding body, the Land Trust, in respect of the mining interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would not even allow the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines with respect to rnining interests to be protected because there would be none being renewed from which Aborigines would need to be protected or from which they could obtain payment in terms of negotiated settlements and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-One of the more interesting pieces of materialist philosophy is what might be called the transcendental <span class="highlight">rights</span> of mining, the sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> of rnining, which are superior- in the view of people such as the honourable member for Lilley  (Mr Kevin Cairns)-  to any other right of any other person in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is that under this legislation we are transferring to the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory the ownership, in a particular form, of the lands to which they have traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but we are not transferring the absolute <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My friend from Lilley points out that there must be no interference with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of renewal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is really not an Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It deals with the mining <span class="highlight">rights</span> on Aboriginal lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, one has almost all the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> which we are now trying to obtain for Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no suggestion at this stage that we should take from people their present <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people in this country have acquired <span class="highlight">rights</span> over land by simply occupying it in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are really genuine about transferring the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the proprietorship of this land to the Aboriginal people, we should not allow the renewal of leases to continue in the present sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support my colleague the honourable member for Hughes  (Mr Les Johnson)  in what he had to say about those other tilings which again put certain <span class="highlight">rights</span> above the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginal people in towns and on Crown lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, if we have to decide a new formula, introduce subsidiary legislation or something of that nature to bring about a different deal in relation to mining <span class="highlight">rights</span>, we should not allow the renewal of leases to continue in their present form because I believe it offends the spirit of the legislation and it will make absolutely certain that there are large parts of the Northern Territory on Aboriginal domain which will never belong to the Aboriginal in the strict sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time in Australia’s history, as a result of this legislation, Aboriginal people will have land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might have been all right to ride roughshod over the Aborigines in bygone times but the whole purpose of this legislation is to grant land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is moving amendments to delete a number of words which would have the effect of giving Aborigines <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this particular matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments are designed to ensure that mining interests with options and other <span class="highlight">rights</span>, interest in land and the like, must seek consent from Aboriginal people in their corporate state when land becomes Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not regard the Minister as having an antipathy to the best interests of Aboriginal People and their quests for land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He used very strong words concerning the Legislative Assembly and the powers that are given to it in this Bill He has insinuated that the Assembly will control these rnining interests and the land on which Aborigines will have mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is completely wrong to say to this Government that the Legislative Assembly members will hold the Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> with regard to minerals in the hollow of their hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the recent Gove Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> case, Yirrkala Aborigines made the point that members of the particular mada -  which is the same as mala-  own their land because their linked mala had association which were . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply point out that the amendments originally proposed by the Government, which are now incorporated in this Bill, are more restrictive of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of mining companies holding mining interests which contain a right of renewal than the original provision in this respect in the Bill which I introduced on 4 June. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that the only <span class="highlight">rights</span> of renewal which are protected are statutory <span class="highlight">rights</span> in existence prior to the land becoming Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without elaboration I refer the Committee to paragraphs 274 and 328, item 9, of his report, and remind the Committee that the legislation deals exclusively with traditional land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposition that the Minister is putting before us is that there should be automatic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of renewal even in respect of the new legalised Aboriginal ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was bad enough, but in the writing of the lease there was an extension so that when it is necessary for the company to have extra facilities available it will have the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to those facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that if we were to assert the paramountcy of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the land in this situation Nabalco would leave this afternoon or tomorrow or before its 42 years were up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose that was one of the first instances in which Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> were claimed in a court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the time has come when we should say that Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> to land are superior to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of miners to the use of that land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not say that they should never be made on reserves because it may be that, in cases where mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span> have already been given, for example at Magellan and at Nabarlek, the reservations to the Crown should, of course, remain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that it would be reasonable to give to the Aboriginals the normal mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span>, with the exceptions of those areas in which some kind of mineral tenure is conceded already. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Old titles in most of the Australian States did carry mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Old titles in the Northern Territory, when it was under South Australian administration and some freehold was given, carried mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  Honour wrestled with the question as to the nature of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> which Aboriginals should have to minerals that might be found within Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as we are concerned it is important that the general principle of <span class="highlight">rights</span> to land not be confined simply to those that happen to be reserves at this particular moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill as I have indicated before deals with traditional land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“(4) In exercising his <span class="highlight">rights</span> under sub-section (3), an Aboriginal is not entitled knowingly to disregard any reasonable requirements of the lessee of the pastoral lease in connexion with the bore waters on the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“(6) A person who, without just cause, proof of which lies upon the person, prevents or obstructs, or attempts to prevent or obstruct, an Aboriginal from exercising his <span class="highlight">rights</span> under this section is guilty of an offence against this section punishable, upon conviction, by a fine not exceeding $1,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in this context, and in the context of those words, that I pay tribute to the pioneering work on the subject of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> which has been undertaken over the years by the Northern Territory legislature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently members opposite do not know that many of the principles governing land <span class="highlight">rights</span> were considered initially in the Northern Territory Legislative Council in the 1960s by people familiar with the needs and traditions of the Aboriginals, developed over many years of direct association with those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it was from those debates that the first recognition of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the Aboriginal people emerged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that sufficient recognition has been given by the Opposition and critics of the responsible approach adopted by the Northern Territory legislature to the question of land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, especially in earlier years when the subject was less fashionable than it is now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts are that every possible step that could be taken to stultify and frustrate the development of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people of Australia has emanated  principally  from the National Country Party, and its principal spokesmen have been people like the Minister for the Northern Territory  (Mr Adermann)  and the members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory, as it is now called. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said before, this Bill is simply the continual entrenchment of vested <span class="highlight">rights</span>, particularly in mining areas but also in pastoral areas, by the people of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts are that unless this Parliament takes the initiative, takes up its own duties and establishes Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span>, these <span class="highlight">rights</span> will never be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is an unwarranted concession to whatever happens to be the sacred State <span class="highlight">rights</span> that prevail somewhere north of the boundary of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will ask the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle),  who will be in charge of the Bill, to look at this clause extremely carefully because it questions our <span class="highlight">rights</span> in relation to what we have responsibility for when compared with State <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural <span class="highlight">Rights</span>  (Question No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-43-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the reason for the inordinate delay that has occurred between the date on which Australia signed the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural <span class="highlight">Rights</span> and the date on which the Covenant was ratified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-43-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia signed the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural <span class="highlight">Rights</span> on 18 December 1972 and ratified it on 10 December 1975: the delay in ratifying the Covenant thus took place under the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-43-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am informed that the Covenant was not ratified earlier because it had been suggested that both the Interantional Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural <span class="highlight">Rights</span> and the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span> should be ratified at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-43-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am further informed that when it was decided not to pursue the original proposal to implement the terms of the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in legislation, it was thought desirable to ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural <span class="highlight">Rights</span> at that stage and examine, separately, what domestic problems were required to be overcome to make it possible for Australia to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-43-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a public interest concept providing for the control and regulation of tourist activity, so that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals and groups are safeguarded, one against the other, and resources are preserved, as considered desirable, for the common good and for future generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-43-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister agree that the raids constitute a blatant violation of civil <span class="highlight">rights</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second Convention accords sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the purpose of exploring and exploiting natural resources to each country over a continental shelf to a depth of 200 metres or to where the superjacent waters admit of the exploitation of natural resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Persons concerned will have certain <span class="highlight">rights</span> if in the future they have to join or do join the Public Service or statutory bodies after leaving Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For too long this Parliament has tinkered with pieces of legislation  ad infinitum,  stacking them end on end so that we are disadvantaged in the way we debate them and the citizen who is trying to find out his or her <span class="highlight">rights</span> and eligibility in respect of various things is also disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is argued that the other members of the community would look at public servants green with envy and demand that their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and eligibilities should be increased to that level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently in 1952 a Labor government was returned and it set to work to change the legislation so that people who were elected to the Victorian Parliament from the Victorian Public Service would be able to return to their jobs with all <span class="highlight">rights</span> reserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently, just before I was elected to this Parliament, the Act was changed- as a matter of fact it was a good piece of behaviour by a Liberal government- so that people elected to the Australian Parliament would be able to return to their jobs up to a period of 9 years after their election with all their <span class="highlight">rights</span> reserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I suggest to the Ministry that it immediately examines the situation in Victoria and places in the Australian Public Service Act, the provisions which permit members of the Public Service elected to a parliament to be able to return to the Public Service upon defeat or retirement with their <span class="highlight">rights</span> reserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the portability of <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the ability to transfer from that service to the general Australian Public Service at will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, there is no question but that they will enjoy full, normal <span class="highlight">rights</span> of promotion from Darwin into positions elsewhere in the Commonwealth Public Service throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, as a matter of fact in law their <span class="highlight">rights</span> are preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could not agree more about the need to reassure Commonwealth public servants presently working in areas which will be delegated to the Legislative Assembly, that their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and their futures will be fully preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Particularly as a Liberal I would urge him to do so because I believe that we, as a Liberal Government, should support the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals to have their opportunities expanded to undertake a career of their choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am amused to hear the honourable member for Kingston  (Mr Chapman)  say that as a Liberal he is interested in women’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>, particularly as just 2 nights ago the Liberal Party had a woman jumping out of a cake in Parliament House, demeaning not only the status of women in this country but also the status of the Ministers and members who were there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us find out from the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the Liberal Party which Ministers and members were at the party so that we can know which Ministers and members of the Liberal Party are interested in the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, dignity and status of Australian women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now find that, with the appointment of a Minister specially involved with women’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> and with the Prime Minister’s glib talk about bis interest in the dignity of women, senior Ministers are party to this kind of charade in Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  mentioned the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill as one very suitable for consideration by legislative committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Upon what authority do they walk roughshod over the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Australian people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should also remind the honourable gentleman that the entitlement of an insured person to the proceeds of an insurance policy is a matter of private contractual right and is a matter which can be pursued according to those private contractual <span class="highlight">rights</span> by the individual concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I make simply is that a lot of these practices can be effectively responded to and effectively coped with by the individuals in question pursuing their <span class="highlight">rights</span> through the civil courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would attribute largely to the Council’s tireless efforts to go to the Aborigines and to listen to their own statement of their viewpoint and wishes the present healthy fact that everywhere within Australia Aborigines now approach Government without inhibition or hesitation, speak up for themselves in no uncertain way, and are quick to demand the full measure of their constitutional <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I take this opportunity to express regret that in recent times there has been a departure from this objectivity, particuarly in regard to the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill in which the Commonwealth appears to be abrogating some of its responsibility by passing it over to the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>(1) For the purposes of this Act, there shall be a Council, to be known as the Broadcasting Council, which, subject to this Act, shall have and may exercise the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, powers, authorities and functions conferred upon it by this Act and shall be charged with and perform the duties and obligations imposed upon it by this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The exercise of the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, powers, authorities or functions, or the performance of the duties or obligations, of the Council shall not be affected by reason only of there being a vacancy in the office of a member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recalling the decisions of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, as well as the recommendations of the World Population Conference, the United Nations World Food Conference, the Second General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation, the World Conference of the International Women’s Year; the Declaration and program of Action adopted by the sixth special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations and the Charter of Economic <span class="highlight">Rights</span> and Duties of States that establish the basis of the New International Economic Order, <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Human dignity and the exercise of free choice consistent with over-all public welfare are basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> which must be assured in every society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All countries, particularly developing countries, must create conditions which make possible the full integration of women and youth in political, economic and social activities, particularly in the planning and implementation of human settlement proposals and in all the associated activities, on the basis of equal <span class="highlight">rights</span>, in order to achieve an efficient and full utilisation of available human resources, bearing in mind that women constitute half of the world population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take the point made at the end of his question about selective commentaries which are made not only in the media but also by those who take an interest in international relations about the restrictions on human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and a prejudice even to the right to life in certain countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that with regard to this question, which involves very difficult questions of international law, the Parliament should look at the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of States in international law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This legislation is concerned with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australia in relation to this matter and the intrusion of anti-trust laws in the United States of America into what basically is Australia’s concern, namely, the price at which we will fix our uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendment proposes an additional term of reference to include in the Committee ‘s functions oversight of exploration and exploitation of Aboriginal lands by mining interests, including those grants made under the proclamation sections of the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> Bill where Aboriginal consent to mining was mandatory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I think that the re-creation of the Standing Committee in the form of a special land <span class="highlight">rights</span> scrutiny committee is a good step towards strengthening the parliamentary committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask honourable members opposite to look at the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill, in particular to clauses 70 ( 1) and 70 (3), which relate to the entry of people onto Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was to the effect that nobody would quibble about an Australian Government asserting its role and <span class="highlight">rights</span> in regard to the housing needs of migrants, servicemen, ex-servicemen, persons living in the Territories, students, employees of the Australian Government or contractors to the Government and their employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A frequent criticism of these pans of the Public Service Act is that they do not adequately protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual employees through, for example, formal <span class="highlight">rights</span> of appeal and perhaps a more direct relationship between the powers and their clear purpose, namely, the efficient and economical functioning of the Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first thing they might have to deal with, of course, is lowlevel threats- such as guerillas, confrontation over seabeds, confrontations over <span class="highlight">rights</span> of passage in the air or on sea, or even conceivably the dispatch of an overseas force to prevent from taking place in our area events which we would regard as contrary to our interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Recommendations involving human <span class="highlight">rights</span> especially the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to privacy and individual freedoms are within my responsibility and the Government is vigorously pursuing a policy of protection of individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms so far as it has power to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-56-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) On what dates, in what form and with what result has the Australian Government consulted with the State Governments on the steps which must be taken to make it possible for Australia to ratify the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span> which entered into force on 23 March 1976 and to enable Australia to meet her international obligations under the covenant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-56-17">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government must not continue to hide and refuse to recognise the importance of this subject, simply saying that it is going to overcome the problems of the people of Australia by establishing a committee on tourism, or on Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, or on foreign affairs, or on expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly, the cost price of such property as land, buildings, construction work in progress, shares, other securities and other legal <span class="highlight">rights</span>, including industrial property such as patents and copyrights, will not be subject to adjustment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was the Government’s intention that all exploration <span class="highlight">rights</span> should be covered in the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been brought to the Government’s attention that the Bill would not have adequately met the Government’s legal commitments to protect  existing <span class="highlight">rights</span> in relation to that agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This legislation and the general subject of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, as we know, has stirred strong emotions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think I can say of the debates in this House and in the other place that the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia has shown a consistent dedication to the passage of legislation to fulfil commitments made by all political parties to the granting of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Aborigines in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I particularly mention  Senator Neville  Bonner who, as we know from our work with him as a colleague and also from what he has said publicly in the Senate, has been dedicated ever since he came into the Parliament to the fulfilment of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not have any tendency at all to abrogate the contract of the company at Grotte Eylandt but what we emphasise is that in this situation, like all other situations, we ought to accept that there is a new land <span class="highlight">rights</span> deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I certainly hope that, despite our differences, with the passage of time the initiatives which were instituted as a result of the election pledge of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  when he was leading the Labor Party into the 1 972 election, to give land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Aboriginals, will come to fruition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-These amendments simply confirm what we said here the other day, that this piece of legislation ought to be renamed the Miners <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Aboriginal Lands) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For years now the Aboriginal people of Australia have been demanding an absolute land <span class="highlight">rights</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been an accepted principle of law almost since the first colonial settlements by the British and by the Spanish that no government has ever taken land <span class="highlight">rights</span> seriously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the time has come when we should not surrender basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> to such things as mining for material advantage and to what is apparently the even more sacred right- State <span class="highlight">rights</span>- which is implicit in attitudes towards the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We might ask why legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> transcend moral <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They spoke about democracy, human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and all the rest, yet they represented some of the most repressive governments in history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are confirming the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the possessors of power in the form of wealth and the mining companies over the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This piece of legislation comes at the endperhaps it is only the beginning- of a long series of negotiations and campaigns for Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose the campaign about land <span class="highlight">rights</span> was generated in the late 1950s and early 1960s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Land <span class="highlight">rights</span> became an issue to Aboriginal people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The campaign for land <span class="highlight">rights</span> flowed from there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From such humble beginnings the great movement for Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> has grown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognise the serious challenge that land <span class="highlight">rights</span> makes to our whole legal system and our whole land property system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to warn the Government that if these amendments are accepted it is quite possible that the position of the Aborigines ideologically in relation to land could be more significant in respect of this country’s position in the world than are the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of mining companies or miners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we were travelling together in a car I told him about Wulaymbuma Wunungmurra, who had refused to be used to lead a group of demonstrators for Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in a procession in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out to the director of the Swiss company that if Wulaymbuma Wunungmurra had not had that perception and had led the group and been hit by the police with batons while demonstrating for his land <span class="highlight">rights</span> the company director and all his public relations would not have made as much impact in the world as would have the violence directed against an Aborigine while demonstrating on such a matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people to land will be swept under the carpet, just like South Africa’s apartheid and many of the other racial issues which were ignored in the past and now have become major world issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has shown sensitivity to mining companies and their interests will not count nearly as much in the world’s evaluation of Australia as will the extent to which Australia recognises the dignity and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of these Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If you reject a man on the grounds of his politics or his religion, he may change them to please you, but if you reject him on the ground of race in any way whatsoever by discrimination in regard to his land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, there is no way in the world he can change his race to please you. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He knows that the claims of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> have never been accepted by the Queensland Government and that this is quite serious for this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have given them voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>, drinking <span class="highlight">rights</span> and fornicating <span class="highlight">rights</span> that they never used to have inter-racially, all of which did not cost the Treasury a farthing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>But this question of their land <span class="highlight">rights</span> may cost something; it may take something from the mining companies or from us or from our future prospects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most Aborigines who are working for their <span class="highlight">rights</span> think it is unfortunate that these sentiments have developed in the Federal Parliament about the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fourthly, following the passage of the Historic Shipwrecks Bill it is necessary that reference be made to its provisions concerning compensation when <span class="highlight">rights</span> to a shipwreck are altered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1963  Dr Philip  Playford of Perth advised the discoverers of the shipwreck of the Dutch East Indiaman  Vergulde Draeck,  or  Gilt Dragon,  that their proper course was to assign all their <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this wreck to the Western Australian Museum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s policy towards the entry of refugees is governed by its obligations as a party to the United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees and its acknowledgement that as a member of the international community it must accept a share of responsibility in refugee and quasi-refugee situations which often involve personal danger and loss of human dignity, basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> and means of livelihood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-86-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If so, does this refer to the patent <span class="highlight">rights</span> jointly held by the Commonwealth and South Australian Governments for a butter/vegetable oil blend; if so, what are the intentions of the Government in this matter; if not, what other power or authority does the Commonwealth possess which is retarding the marketing of more spreadable butter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-86-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Has the Indonesian Government indicated through diplomatic channels that Australian companies with petroleum and mineral concessions in East Timor will be welcome to stay if they negotiate their <span class="highlight">rights</span> with the Indonesian Government <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-94-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Down that road lies totalitarianism and the progressive restriction of the freedom of the individual, the basic right of the individual to exercise the maximum freedom of choice, compatible with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of his fellow citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#subdebate-13-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, the voters elected a Government which is dedicated to increasing the freedom of the individual and the respect of his basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> as an individual, while at the same time exercising its responsibility as a Government to protect and to assist those in our community who cannot care adequately for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#subdebate-13-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As part of that policy the Government is now arming itself with a far more extensive array of powers to suppress the incomes and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the wage and salary earners and their trade unions than any Government has ever contemplated in the history of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#subdebate-13-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal to establish an industrial relations bureau and the legislation now before the House in relation to the Trade Practices Act, which in fact would cover about 95 per cent of trade union activity, are the most extensive powers that any government has ever sought to control unions and employees in this country or restrict their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to organise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#subdebate-13-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having done that, however, it is illogical to suggest that those people should then be given the full <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of permanency as would be given to any other members of the Public Service if they have not had a similar background. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My basic objection to it is not just at the political level and does not concern just the privileges or <span class="highlight">rights</span> of public servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The former Advisory Council of the Australian Capital Territory passed a series of resolutions between 1965 and 1967 seeking voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> in referendums and the former Northern Territory Legislative Council passed a similar resolution on 1 1 October 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will recall that a proposal to give Territory electors referendum voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> was included in the Constitution Alteration (Mode of Altering the Constitution) Bill that failed at a referendum in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That this House places on record its extreme regret at the action of the Czechosolvakian Government in arresting and imprisoning 6 civil liberties dissidents, including the civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> leader Frantisek Krieqel, the distinguished writer <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Pavel Kohout and the former Czech Foreign Minister Jiri Hajek, following the publication in Prague in January this year of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Charter known as Charter 77 signed by over 240 scholars, writers and politicians demanding the restoration of basic civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Czechoslovakia as guaranteed by the Helsinki pact of 1975 and further, this House calls upon the Czechoslovakian Government to restore basic civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> to all citizens of Czechoslovakia regardless of their political or religious affiliations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are still many people who look apprehensively at the Constitution, believing that the inherent <span class="highlight">rights</span> that our forebears, who in some way they believe were more wise than those of us who succeeded, wrote down so many years ago should inevitably survive without modification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is necessary when filling casual vacancies that we recognise that there will be a prescribed procedure which will enable the State governments to determine the manner by which they will select persons to fill casual vacancies, and which will ensure that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States are preserved, as it shall be certified by the Governor of the State and not by the GovernorGeneral, and that Governor of the State will then be able to submit the name and the person will be appointed in accordance with a constitutional requirement which I believe will validly set out a fit and proper procedure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The result is often to leave a significant degree of discretion to those exercising the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or wielding the powers legally conferred, defined or permitted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would think that most people in Australia would recognise that residents of the Territories are citizens of Australia and that they should not be excluded by some narrow legal definition from exercising their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to vote in national referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The referendum to grant people living in the Territories voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the purposes of referendums is a small step towards recognising them as full Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I can see no logical argument against it, I can see some emotive State <span class="highlight">rights</span> argument which I believe does not have any weight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appeal to all voting Australians to support this move to see that their fellow citizens in the Territories are given the right to vote in referenda so that they can exercise the same democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> as all other voting citizens and express their points of view of issues which concern them as much as they concern other citizens of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the acceptance of this proposition will remove one of the main obstacles to full citizens’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Territorial citizens it will not remove the doubt cast on the validity of Territorial representation which was implied in the remarks of the Chief Justice in the recent High Court judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We provided for these contingencies and we are now exercising those <span class="highlight">rights</span> as laid down under the Constitution to make the amendments by way of referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From an historical point of view one cannot be blamed for having a deep concern about the future <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people of the Australian Capital Territory, and the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another argument that has been put up against these proposals is that they constitute an erosion of States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> and of Senate powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I fail to see how the retirement of federal  judges  at 70 years of age constitutes in any way an erosion either of States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> or of Senate powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been argued by one of the senators in the upper house- I think it was  Senator Wood-  that all these proposals constitute an erosion of States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Uganda regime, whose suppression of the exercise of basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and civil liberties is well documented, cannot avoid responsibility for that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They result inevitably from situations in which people are denied the exercise of basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedom of expression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In Uganda, as in other places where violations occur, the Government urges the speediest possible restoration of these basic <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Government intend to express its concern about  President  Amin’s regime to the United Nations Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member’s first question concerned an application to the United Nations Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree, as I imagine everybody else in this House agrees, with article 23 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian people endorsed this Government and its policy proposals because they did not want those boycotts; they did not want that sort of malicious conduct from people like the honourable member for Burke, who spoke before me in this debate and who made it clear that the unions want to be able to hold other people to ransom, that they want to be able to deal in a harsh and unconscionable way with other people’s property and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of fundamental importance in this legislation that there is the protection of minority interests, that there is the protection of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals and that there is genuinely equality before the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The alternative is that the Government is composed of knaves because it is indulging in action which will bring about in this country an industrial confrontation which simply must occur if the unions are to preserve their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to act collectively and to take any form of industrial action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At times when business became too big it developed its own bureaucracy and the bureaucracy of big business, big unions or big government often militate against the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He gave himself away when he said that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the trade union movements must be preserved and any form of industrial action should be preserved as the province of the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is a pluralist society in which checks and balances have to be found between the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of various groups and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is a complete denial of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of housewives to purchase bread at reasonable prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He is frightened that this section might show the working people of Australia that they have <span class="highlight">rights</span> against people of privilege who pull them out on bans that work very much against their best interests as breadwinners; as people who want to go to work; as people who want to buy consumer goods, and as people who have children to raise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for St George  (Mr Neil)  referred in this House last year to the report of the International Commission of Jurists of May 1974 which showed evidence of a massive and continuing violation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Uganda which suggested a planned campaign of systematic liquidation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to think that the Prime Minister of this country, or of any country interested in the preservation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, would be seated at the same conference table as  President  Amin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is time for us to express our views in a frank, honest and direct way not only in relation to Uganda but also in relation to all countries which suppress human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and prostitute human dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister noted reports that the Channel 9 network has obtained exclusive <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the Jubilee cricket test series between Australia and the Marylebone Cricket Club in England this year and to the Wimbledon, French and American tennis titles? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has he seen the reported statement by the  Chairman  of Channel 9 that the reason his network obtained these <span class="highlight">rights</span> over the ABC could be given in one word, money, and that the deal cost a total of $2m? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the ABC also seeking these <span class="highlight">rights</span> but was unable to match the bid made by Channel 9 because of cuts in funds? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are areas in which the activities of some union leaders have restricted freedom and inhibited human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and human dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When unions take industrial action to put pressure on an employer in defence of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of trade unionists they will have to be conscious not only of the sections of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act but also of the sections of the Trade Practices Act, particularly proposed section 45D. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would have the effect of prohibiting all industrial action, such as strikes, working to regulations and picketing, regardless of how justified that action might be to defend trade unionists’ <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This most suspicious piece of legislation will certainly plunge the country into industrial confrontation, because if the unions accept it without some kind of battle they will forfeit aU <span class="highlight">rights</span> to act as trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Appropriate provisions to be incorporated in the legislation are being investigated by the Government, and other matters which are pending consideration but which are not in this Bill relate to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of franchisees, the liabilities of financiers for breach of consumer conditions and warranties and the application of this legislation to professional activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Wilson Government, to its eternal credit, altered the law again after the  Rookes v.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equality of political <span class="highlight">rights</span> may mean that strictly and mathematically there is a variation which will upset the purists, that the Parliament will be better and stronger because representation is given to those areas and, indeed, to those States which are entitled to a base representation which should not, under any formula, be subject to reduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same rime equality of political <span class="highlight">rights</span> is inherent in a true democratic state and the electoral system must not be used to benefit a particular Party and disadvantage the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The participating States on whose territory national minorities exist will respect the right of persons belonging to such minorities to equality before the law, will afford them the full opportunity for the actual enjoyment of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and fundamental freedoms and will, in this manner, protect their legitimate interests in this sphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-40-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will remember stating on 1 1 November 1976 that he had an express undertaking from the Majority Leader of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly that any draft ordinances complementary to this Parliament s Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act would be prepared in consultation with htm and must be acceptable to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the United Nations we as a nation applaud the freedoms that are there espousedhuman <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the protection of the individual’s life and property, the freedom of countries from aggression, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another matter to which reference has been made is the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will recall that the Labor Government introduced the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill in 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Bill clearly espoused the <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It meant that we as a Parliament would legislate to guarantee that people had <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Personally my own view is that those <span class="highlight">rights</span> ought to be spelled out in the Constitution itself, but it is important for them to be incor- porated in legislation and to be enforceable in legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that the Government is saying is that it will establish a human <span class="highlight">rights</span> commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill of 1 973 was defeated by the present Government with its numbers in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were relying on the external affairs powers in respect of our legislation so that this Parliament would be able to say right throughout Australia that <span class="highlight">rights</span> could be guaranteed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the trend announced by  President  Carter in his decision that in future United States aid will be predicated by the requirement that recipients maintain acceptable standards of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> could well prove to be an initiative of the greatest significance which Australia will have to watch with considerable interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wanted to talk tonight about the struggles of this Parliament to assert its own <span class="highlight">rights</span> and its own power against forces that flow down through history which have betrayed the reasons for its very existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is instructive to look at the struggles of the 17th century in which the Parliament asserted its <span class="highlight">rights</span> eventually against the monarchy, against Charles I by his ultimate execution, against James II by his ultimate abdication and against any future transgression by monarchs in the arrangements that it made with William and Mary in 1688. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The communists in Vietnam are engaging in a grievous and systematic violation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, including the detention of an estimated 300 000 people in so-called re-education camps, the suppression of cultural and political expression and the stifling of non-violent dissent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We wanted to believe desperately- so desperately- the pledge and the promises of respect that would be shown (by the Communists) towards human beings and human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We see in the maintenance of an association with the Monarch a preservation of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the operation of provisions of the  Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act  1976 relating to the identification of traditional owners of Aboriginal land and the means of establishing the views of such owners to the satisfaction of the relevant Land Council; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the committee or any sub-committee have power to consider and make use of the minutes of evidence and records of the Joint Select Committee on Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in the Northern Territory appointed during the First Session of the Thirtieth Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I want to say that during the period in which the Parliament has been prorogued there have been some disheartening developments in respect of the Aboriginal and Northern Territory land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a very time consuming activity to belong to the Joint Select Committee on Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in the Northern Territory, particularly because members of the House of Representatives who are involved also have responsibilities in regard to inquiries concerning Aboriginal health and alcoholism among Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With the growth over the years of the power of public and private bureaucracies, particular care needs to be taken to protect individual liberties and human <span class="highlight">rights</span> against unwarranted intrusions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have heard in this place and in public debate about the impinging of government bureaucracy on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Government is acting also to protect and expand political <span class="highlight">rights</span> and strengthen the responsibility and responsiveness of governments to their citizens . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is conscious of the encroaching bureaucracy and of the power that the bureaucracy has to impinge on personal <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment moves are being made, I believe most insidiously, by some of those large corporations to restrict the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual businessmen- in fact I believe eventually to force them out of business- so that the oil industry and the retailing industry of petroleum products will become totally monopolised by a very few large companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queen mentioned in her opening address that the Government has certain legislation in hand to correct the monopolising power of big unions and the way they are able to extend and impinge upon the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms of their members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the provisions that the Government is planning to introduce in this session of Parliament will do no more in their totality than allow the individual in society to have <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms that I believe every Australian citizen has the right to expect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>According to the  Australian,  ‘there are hints of Arab money, of an influence from Queensland, of links with Eric Butler’s League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> and a sinister connection with a strange organisation called the Sinless Perfection’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of supreme irony that the main industrial issue dealt with in the Speech followed a homily on individual liberties and human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the area of industrial relations, one of vital importance to the economic and social well-being of the Australian community, my Government will bring down legislation to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals and the community, and establish an industrial relations bureau. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has begun a violent and carefully timed attack on the Australian work force and on the trade unions which guard its <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I put it to you,  Mr Deputy Speaker-  I know you to be a reasonable man- what <span class="highlight">rights</span> have people who have no advantage because of disability, station in life or a variety of other reasons, to live their lives in the way they want to live them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately, most people look upon their own <span class="highlight">rights</span> as being divine and on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other people as being unnecessary or wasteful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, the Committee foundered upon special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span>- known as SDRs- which were concerned with transferring real resources from the wealthy to the poor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that if there is any difference from a civil liberties or civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> point of view that difference would be in favour of the Russian regime which for a number of reasons, one being the effluxion of time, has now reached the stage where at least it allows or is unable to prevent dissent from within and allows dissenters some publicity at least outside the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is impossible to make an accurate assessment of these figures, let alone authenticate them but they all point to a gross violation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, perhaps in relative terms infinitely more serious than the situation in any other country at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is not just a matter of what we did or what the Government did; it is a question of Australia’s interests in relation to our credibility and our standing in the community of nations on the question of the preservation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and on the question of self-determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is highly desirable that we maintain good relations with Indonesia, but I suggest that these relations should be based on a mutual respect for basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the right of selfdetermination for all nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is only through the activities of a small band of people who have been prepared to speak up for basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and particularly through the actions of  Mr Jim  Dunn- shame on those who seek to frustrate his actions- coupled with the advent of the Carter Administration that we now have been able to get the United States of America interested in the Timor question and in looking at the allegations of atrocities and of the use of American military aid in Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is a lack of trust of the Arab nations and a hatred of the PLO and the tactics it has used, which have gone beyond what is normal warfare and a people’s right to attempt to win back their <span class="highlight">rights</span>, if that is what the Arabs think they are doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some claimed that they were not getting the full <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and maybe they were not; but there was a free debate at which the Prime Minister was on the podium and was cross-examined and attacked by Arabs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Later in the day the Deutsche Welle radio station broadcast a report, which was later seized on by other western news media, saying that ‘Yuri Orlov, a prominent human <span class="highlight">rights</span> campaigner’ was arrested by the Soviet authorities ‘ for his dissenting views. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have heard it said that the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act and the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act have the effect of introducing separatism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now to deny the indigenous people <span class="highlight">rights</span> is, in my view, far from being honest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that Australia is prepared to express a view, and to express a strong view if necessary, at Belgrade this year at the conference to consider the application of the Helsinki Pact, that we as a country believe it is about time that those countries behind the Iron Curtain which deny basic civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> to their citizens should think again and should at least acknowledge that they have a responsibility to ensure that those who live within their boundaries have the same basic freedoms and <span class="highlight">rights</span> as we enjoy in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know that there are some honourable members opposite who think that the Indonesians have <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if they think Indonesia has <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Timor, it has no right to interfere with the activities of an Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the first congress in 1955, successive congresses have made an intensive examination of the problem of crime in modern society and have explored a number of imaginative and practical measures to meet this problem, covering such diverse areas as the integration of crime prevention planning with planning in urban development and education, new forms and dimensions of crime, the economic and social costs of crime, alternatives to imprisonment, the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> of prisoners and the organisation of research to assist in the formulation of policy to deal with crime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> of which Australia is a signatory states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have shirked their responsibilities to minority groups who have <span class="highlight">rights</span> also in a democratic community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Albert  has lectured to school students and trainee teachers, he has been a member of the Regional Council for Social Development in Alice Springs and was a member of the Aboriginal Legal <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Movement in Adelaide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have opposed the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people as individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But Tasmanian members are well within their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to ask for such assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no reason they should not do as they have done, that is, stand up for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Tasmanian apple and pear growers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> and wrongs of this are beside the point; all the evidence of history reflects it as a part of the human condition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the area of industrial relations, one of vital importance to the economic and social well-being of the Australian community, my Government will bring down legislation to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals and the community, and establish an Industrial Relations Bureau. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that the resources to house them, to give them jobs, to provide their children with education and to provide security to the older sections of the family who ought to have proper reunion <span class="highlight">rights</span> must be made available to those people, hopefully in family units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, of course, there is the issue of women’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find emphasis in this very generalised speech on individual <span class="highlight">rights</span>, on equality of opportunity and on equality and opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, in a perverse way, it deals with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It deals with their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to act as brigands in commercial piracy, preying on the weak, the small investor who is perhaps bemused by avarice and so easy prey for the smart boys. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Information as to the provisions in the rules of the four Western Australian Health benefits organisations concerning election <span class="highlight">rights</span> of contributors was available from Departmental sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the question of royalties, it would be very hard for a government to be arbitrary and say that Australia’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> must be preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the question of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aborigines in the Northern Territory, the Labor Government introduced its legislation but because of what happened in December 1975 the legislation did not come before the Parliament for a decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measures are being taken to secure the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those living in Commonwealth territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implementation of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation is proceeding and my Government will continue to revue the effectiveness of government programs for Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the people of Australia I recall the paragraph of the Speech concerning securing the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those living in Commonwealth territories’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On my 1975 visit to Alice Springs I listened to the fears of many tribal elders, and carefully looked through the Alice Springs land <span class="highlight">rights</span> applications sent for my opinion by  Mr Eames. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the people who advised the previous government and this Government on the Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill in its present form shows how the Territory-born residents, both whites and tribal blacks, are still being treated as fifth-rate colonials by many of the sporting political nobles of all parties in that Australian Versailles which is so insensitive to the hopes and fears of most ordinary Australians- Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure no one would deny the Aborigines <span class="highlight">rights</span> to fish off Maningrida, Croker Island, Goulburn Island or Elcho Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the sort of attitude which is being taken towards the people in the Northern Territory by those who put together the Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation and who have pushed it on to the people in the Northern Territory without really consulting them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its basic purpose is to codify and clarify the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and duties of citizens and the Commonwealth Police, when involved in the process of criminal investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is part of a comprehensive review of the laws of the Commonwealth which closely touch the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the life of this Parliament important steps have already been taken or foreshadowed which protect and advance human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and it is appropriate to refer to but a few. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>References have been given by me to the Law Reform Commission upon a number of matters which are vital to the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In  Her  Majesty’s Speech this month it was announced that the Government intended to establish a human <span class="highlight">rights</span> commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim of the legislation will be to give effective machinery on a national basis to protect and advance human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These steps reflect the Government’s concern with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual and the need to update the law and legal protective machinery so that these <span class="highlight">rights</span> can be asserted in the present age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill is especially relevant for the Government’s stated intention to establish a human <span class="highlight">rights</span> commission, a basic purpose of which will be to ensure that our federal law complies with the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The International Covenant is itself part of an international movement to protect human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, which originated after the Second World War and was foreshadowed in the Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> agreed upon early in the life of the United Nations Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore natural and entirely to be expected that the International Covenant refers to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a person in this circumstance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It represents the standard which civilised communities around the world agree should govern the civil and political <span class="highlight">rights</span> of their people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not, therefore, underestimate too readily the <span class="highlight">rights</span> which our own system already guarantees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill must therefore be seen in the context both of the important initiatives taken by the Government in Australia to advance and protect human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and against the background of the International Covenant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> should not be left in vague general terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its preparation, an endeavour has been made to strike a balance between the community’s needs for effective law enforcement and the need to preserve and respect basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time the basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms of the individual citizens in our democracy must be preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To ensure that, in the interrogation of persons suspected of committing an offence, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the suspect are not infringed and to reduce to the minimum disputes as to the accuracy of records of such interviews, provisions will be made requiring that such interviews be tape recorded or be conducted in the presence of an independent third party and reduced to writing or, if neither of these courses is practicable in the particular circumstances, a written record of the interview be verified by an independent third party as soon as possible after it is made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That which results from Aborigines not know their own <span class="highlight">rights</span> or having the power to apply them, so that in the courts of the North many more Aborigines are arrested and charged with drunkenness and appear before the courts without adequate legal representatives, say, than is the case with the white community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have no <span class="highlight">rights</span> whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I have related is just an example of what has been frequently pointed out- that overseas born residents are often ignorant of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> in and the resources of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be endorsing that principle because we, as government supporters, know that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual must be preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What greater <span class="highlight">rights</span> can there be than for that individual to go about his business to determine his life in his own manner with a minimum of interference from anyone else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is committed to the protection and advancement of Australians’ political <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I believe that this is not the occasion on which to speak about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and wrongs or the details of the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I point out- I think I owe it to my friend the honourable member for Wills, and I am sure the  Chairman  will forgive me if I disclose one of the confidences of the Committee- that I was the person who raised the right and the need for the honourable member for Wills to be given full <span class="highlight">rights</span> of reply both here and to the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission was established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will certainly be no erosion of these <span class="highlight">rights</span> as a result of amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to repeal the 1 964 legislation which created the Bureau of Roads and I particularly draw honourable members’ attention to the fact that in conformity with the Government’s policies the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of officers and employees of the Bureau will be safeguarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither Australia nor, as far as I am aware, any other country has lodged a protest with the United Nations about human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-40-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the whole range of Labor initiatives and Labor achievements- in health, in education, in social security, in child care, in industrial policy, in incomes policy, in human <span class="highlight">rights</span>- we can see that women and children are as much the beneficiaries as men, and that those in greatest need receive the greatest benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor’s policies in these fields are policies for women; they are part of our program to improve the welfare and widen the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and opportunities of the whole community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people believed that our main concern was for the minority of career-minded women with higher education; that we were interested in abstract questions of women’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> and women’s liberation rather than bread and butter issues; that the opportunities of professional women came before the needs of housewives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must move from a particular concern with specific women’s interests and <span class="highlight">rights</span> to a more general concern for women as members of the community, as consumers, as members of the workforce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was natural that in our first period of government we set about restoring women’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and removing discrimination in all its social, economic or legal forms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ratified the International Labour Organisation Equal Remuneration Convention 1951, and the United Nations Convention on the Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span> of Women, 1953. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We appointed the Royal Commission into Human Relationships- an inquiry of fundamental importance to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and needs of women and families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until women have equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> to employment they cannot be said to have equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> as citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Is the Prime Minister aware of the violation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> which is still taking place in the Philippines under the system of martial law? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he agree that violation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in extreme rightist controlled countries such as the Philippines is equally as reprehensible as the violation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in communist countries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Finally, will the Government use its best endeavours in the appropriate forum to prevent the violation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Philippines? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, he overlooked the fact that the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill, which was initiated by the Labor Government when it was in office, gives rise to a potential claim for that area by the Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One would hope that as an up and coming nation we would evertually develop a national spirit to the stage where we want an anthem of our own and not be just exercising some sort of discretionary voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> as to a tune for a national song. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to note that the people in the Territories will at least get a chance to exercise some <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this matter as they will not be able to do in respect of the 4 major referendums which will be dealt with on the same day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has been suggested that it is wrong to interfere with the freedom of individual Australians, that perhaps we should not prevent them from engaging in activities overseas, that it would be contrary to their individual <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but if we consider the question we realise that we are talking about the right to engage in hostile activities of the nature described. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely if we are talking about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those people whom we are anxious to protect in that regard, we must look at the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the rest of mankind who will be on the receiving end of that hostile activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the legislation in its present form protects those important <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual to serve in a cause in which he believes but at the same time protects the public interest and as far as possible ensures the maintenance of good international relations between Australia and other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Much has been said to the effect that there should be a letout for certain individuals because of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals but those individuals, in accepting Australian nationality, also accept responsibilities to the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provisions of the Bill extend to every territory, including, I suppose, the penguins in Antarctica where we have extra-territorial <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I turn now to some of the other decisions that have been made, particularly those concerning efforts to tax those people who are not in this country- efforts to claim extra-territorial <span class="highlight">rights</span> in taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people of the Territories have been able to exercise their democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> and elect people to this Parliament to represent them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would also like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that Australia, as a member of the United Nations and as a country that participates in world debate in respect of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of human beings in all countries and in all territories, has subscribed to the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> provisions, particularly in respect of Article 25 which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What right have people in Queensland to dictate as to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of others in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are spending millions of dollars putting a proposition to the people saying to them that we have an act of Parliament that will interpose the words ‘and the Territories’ after the word ‘State’ in section 128 of the Constitution so that under that section people in the territories will have the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> to vote as people in the States have for House of Representatives elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are spending millions of dollars on presenting a case suggesting that the people of the Territories are to get democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> but these <span class="highlight">rights</span> perhaps will be denied by judicial interpretation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I say, irrespective of what happens on 21 May, in other words if there was a resounding majority decision to give people in the Territories their basic <span class="highlight">rights</span>, a High Court decision made before or after that date will remove those <span class="highlight">rights</span> by interpretation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those people came to Australia because they understood that it was a democratic country, that it was a country that would go ahead and would look after the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How strange it must seem to those soldiers, sailors and airmen who fought for this country and who have been transferred to Canberra to find that when they were in Queensland or in other States they were able to vote on federal issues and on referendums but that when they came across an artificial line to live in Canberra they lost those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal will not interfere with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A Yes vote at the referendum would ensure that over 150 000 voters living in the Territories would have the same basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> as the rest of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The referendum proposes only that we should have the same basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> as all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I find it really hard to believe that, after responsible government has been in existence for so long in this country and after the democratic battles of the past, which went on for so long in this country and in other countries, we now have to start all over again and start fighting for the same basic democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> involving something like 300 000 Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is now a group of people whom I can only describe as political troglodytes or power hungry legal eagles who seek to turn the clock back and play petty politics with people’s basic <span class="highlight">rights</span>, people who for the sake of some cheap political advantage, for the sake of influencing a referendum result are prepared to deny basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> to or disenfranchise 300 000 Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been pushed around a lot in the last couple of years and I can assure the people who are interested in that exercise that the people of the Australian Capital Territory will not sit back and take kindly this attempt to deny them their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will be over at this Parliament House demanding their <span class="highlight">rights</span> as have the people of Australia throughout history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Most of the debate about the Constitution these days is about State <span class="highlight">rights</span> or about federalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If our Constitution does not protect the people in their basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> it is time we had a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> which did protect them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, the debate has not been about individuals <span class="highlight">rights</span>; it has been about State <span class="highlight">rights</span> and about Federal powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we have to start interpreting the Constitution more in terms of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual and if it is deficient it is time that we wrote something into it or adopted a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> which would cover these things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When those people arrive in the Territory they are not asked to give up the <span class="highlight">rights</span> they have enjoyed in other parts of the Commonwealth; and why should they? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That money is being used for the purpose of making a phoney legal challenge to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people of Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure those political troglodytes, as I call them, and legal eagles who seek to deprive the people of the Australian Capital Territory of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> that we will not take such a challenge lying down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people are not in the mood to have taken from them <span class="highlight">rights</span> which have been hard won after years and years of struggle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, I am sure that the people of Canberra will be prepared to speak up for themselves and will demand that those people who seek to take away their <span class="highlight">rights</span> justify their actions, if they can do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the view expressed by the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp)  when he said that people are getting fed up with the cheap political posturing that goes on between the States and the Commonwealth, the lack of principle which underlies their actions, the complete disregard for basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and the concentration on some cheap temporary political gain at the expense of other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We feel very keenly about the blow which has been aimed at the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Territorians, and in that I include the people of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When I was elected to this place in 1966 it was on a platform which included full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the people of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It comes as a surprise to me that these men and their Governments for whatever reason, are aiming a blow at the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the citizens of both Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the House that the Northern Territory has been represented in this place since 1922 and the representative of the Northern Territory has had full voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> since 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We beat on the doors and sent a petition to Canberra supporting our demand for basic <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Northern Territory seem to have been fighting, certainly ever since I have been a member of this House and since Jock Nelson, the former member, was in this House, a continual battle to obtain the <span class="highlight">rights</span> which we should have as Australian citizens and which I believe we did have in the years from 1907 to 191 1. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when the Territory passed to the Commonwealth, those <span class="highlight">rights</span> seemed to be whisked away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my colleague the honourable member for Canberra pointed out earlier, at this time we are really battling to have those <span class="highlight">rights</span> brought back again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people in the Northern Territory should have similar <span class="highlight">rights</span> to those of all other Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government has an unhappy record in regard to civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> and such matters when it comes to the areas which it chooses to call ‘public interest’ or ‘national security’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As soon as I saw this piece of legislation, I started to think of the current situation in relation to Timor, Indonesia’s claims to it, the rather ambivalent attitude that the Australian Government has to those Indonesian claims and the response that one could expect from this Government at any moment as a result of the activities of people in this country such as myself in encouraging and supporting the people of East Timor in their attempt to fight for their own <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find one of the more ‘distressing’ areas of parliamentary thought the fact that when the Bill goes from here it is likely to get rougher treatment in the Senate in respect of trespassing on human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and things like that, so bless me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members look at the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> provisions set down by the United Nations they will see that they clearly show that a person shall not engage in acts of violence that will endanger the lives of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If not permitting such activity were an infringement of civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> and civil liberties of Australians citizens I make no apology for expressing that point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He will have noticed that the Queensland Government has awarded the <span class="highlight">rights</span> over the Oakey Creek coal area in the Bowen Basin to a foreign company, apparently without considering the claims of other companies, including Australian owned and managed ones, and has stipulated that the foreign company must allow a 20 per cent Australian equity in the project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I should also say to the honourable gentleman that should any proceedings of this character be instituted, and should they be proceedings which are capable of being taken- having in mind a question as to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people to bring proceedings of this character in the High Court- then no doubt if applications are made to me in relation to legal assistance I will give those requests careful consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There have been recent allegations of massive atrocities and these have compounded the basic fears we have all had since that fateful morning in December 1 975- a morning when a despicable chapter was written in blood in the history of our region, a morning when tanks, guns and bombardment served as the curtain upon the basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a people to self-determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 22 of the Bill continues the Government’s policy of expanding, wherever possible, the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to administrative decisions which affect <span class="highlight">rights</span> or entitlements of persons under Commonwealth legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of clause 1 1 together with clause 13 of the Bill is to continue the Government’s policy of expanding, wherever possible, the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to administrative decisions which affect <span class="highlight">rights</span> or entitlements of persons under Commonwealth legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Look at domestic reforms: The public lending right, insurance deposits, Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, Aboriginal councils and associations, the maritime college, the family allowances and the simultaneous elections referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those principles are: Each member of our community has both <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations; individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> must be protected; equally, obligations must be met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Industrial relations affect all of us and we, as Government, accept that it is our responsibility to develop an industrial relations framework in which the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals are protected, for example the right to choose employment and to join, or not to join, industrial organisations; labour and management can communicate and settle differences in a manner which recognises the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities of both; and the community at large is protected from harsh and disruptive effects of industrial disputation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government regards the protection of individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> as fundamental and inalienable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is one further amendment relating to this important issue of individual <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These provisions are designed to ensure that the basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual members of organisations are enhanced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular it will provide a focal point for non-English speaking workers to obtain assistance when they are concerned about their <span class="highlight">rights</span> as employees and union members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that its amendments to a number of sections of the Act not only provide a more effective way of assisting individual union members in maintaining their <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but also will cut out excessive legalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In clause 15, it is proposed that, in dealing with such cases in the future, the court be enabled to fix a monetary penalty, to deregister an organisation or to suspend all or any of the capacities, <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of an organisation or its members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, I would again reiterate that the Government is pledged to protect individual <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the community, in industrial relations matters, and ensure the observance of the obligations labour and management have to each other and the community at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government proposes the strengthening of provisions relating to the protection of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals against unfair actions by employers and organisations; the establishment of an Industrial Relations Bureau as a focal point for securing the observance of the industrial laws; and the extension of the range of consequences available to the court in dealing with breaches of industrial law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to raise tonight a serious situation concerning the issue of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and what I can only assume to be the most unsatisfactory nature of diplomatic representation by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What are the general <span class="highlight">rights</span> of national groups in the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How does this compare with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or the Jewish community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Soviet Union and in other countries has concerned me and I have placed a question on notice for the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  seeking information on the number of political prisoners in every country on which information can be obtained and I eagerly await that reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the front page of this special issue under the heading ‘Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> and Socialism’ the statement is made that in the Soviet Union there is ‘the right to freedom of religion’, which of course stands most peculiarly alongside the correspondence I have just mentioned from the Soviet Embassy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, it seems to me that the Soviet Union is jeopardising detente and world peace and is curiously supersensitive on the issue of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> when it complains so bitterly about  President  Carter’s comments on Soviet dissidents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have come from an almost feudal state in South Australia as far as people’s attitudes or the attitude of the rulers of that State to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people are concerned to the stage today where obviously those who observe the electoral laws of the various States and of the Commonwealth would regard South Australia as being the guiding light on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How can a government appeal to unions for co-operation when it is pushing legislation through the Parliament to restrict their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms in a way that no other democracy in the world has contemplated? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The scales use the numbers 1-7, with 1 comparatively offering the highest level of political or civil <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and 7 the lowest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the greatest argument that could be advanced by those in Western Australia who believe in State <span class="highlight">rights</span> is the fact that Western Australia has to take loads and loads of highly protected goods- bounty paid goods- from this side of the continent and at the same time has to compete with its minerals and rural products on world markets in relation to which Western Australia gets no protection at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some people in the State Parliament in Western Australia who are always standing up for State <span class="highlight">rights</span> and who never hesitate to lecture their Federal representatives whenever they get the chance to do so about the importance of State <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but I have never heard one of them stand up in recent years and speak about the importance of the matters to which I have been alluding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This practice also occurs with regard to statements made by Ministers but Ministers have <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this House which are not available to ordinary members, that is, the right to table documents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not wishing to join the army he visited the Australian Consulate in Milan where he was informed of his <span class="highlight">rights</span> regarding his Australian passport and was told that the Consulate could do nothing further about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During question time on Tuesday, the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  made a statement on what he sees as the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of persons to oppose government decisions and government policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that that statement is most likely the narrowest interpretation of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals in a democratic society ever made by any person supposedly holding a responsible office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any honourable member who reads what the Prime Minister said in this House will see quite clearly that he disagrees with that proposition and that, on behalf of the present Government of Australia, he has said that those <span class="highlight">rights</span> do not exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Right through these documents we see the consequence of that devaluation decision where any payment has to be made abroad in foreign currency or something like special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the International Monetary Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has undermined Australia’s credibility as a nation prepared to act on questions of self-determination and human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-21-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General, when introducing the Bill, placed a lot of emphasis on, in fact devoted a fair section of his speech to, the difficulties in assessing the relative merits of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> as against the need to protect the public interest where crime is involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is where we get into this problem of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are one’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> regarding the law when those enforcing the law are endeavouring to ascertain whether a crime has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One then enters into the area of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, about which we are now talking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, when the Attorney-General talks about human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, that is certainly the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is entitled to talk about the Bill because it was a former Attorney-General, Kep Enderby, who encouraged the Law Reform Commission to look at this question, particularly with regard to civil <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, with regard to the question of investigation and what it means, we are talking about what I have said already, that is, the need to maintain a proper balance between protection for the individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties on the one hand and the community’s need for practical and effective law enforcement on the other hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recurring theme throughout the Commission’s report is that there are common law <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but the <span class="highlight">rights</span> are illusory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well to talk about <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but let us see them spelt out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">rights</span> are to be of any use to us they must be enforceable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this rather legalistic term means is that evidence obtained in contravention of the rules should be inadmissible, unless the prosecution can satisfy the court that it should be introduced in the public interest without unduly interfering with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the accused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Attorney-General, in his second reading speech, quoted at length from the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The question is the perennial one of individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> versus law enforcement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Law Reform Commission is to be congratulated for making provision for these advances to be used in enforcing the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the accused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has been through it all before; but the person who is not used to this sort of thing may not be aware of his <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is another instance of common law <span class="highlight">rights</span> being practically worthless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his second reading speech the Attorney-General mentioned those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is pretty obvious, because common law <span class="highlight">rights</span> are theoretical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General would know, that during the time that he was in the Senate  Mr Justice  Murphy was anxious to introduce a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that we could rely on the common law <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the common law has had any genus it has been of a textbook type and not of a practical type, lt Ls for that reason we do need law which spells out what people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the provision for a person to sign an acknowledgment that he had received a warning as to his <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommendation of the majority of the Commission was that in cases where the police suspected that a person had committed a serious crime they should not question that person, nor seek to have him accompany them to the station or elsewhere, without first advising him of his <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The method of ensuring that that was done would be to have the person sign the acknowledgment that he was advised of his <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first was that very few citizens are aware of their common law <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the police are not always able to inform them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means, in effect, that the individual’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> are illusionary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the majority was saying was that no person should be deprived of his <span class="highlight">rights</span> because of ignorance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The best sort of education in this area is to inform a person of his <span class="highlight">rights</span> at the time those <span class="highlight">rights</span> are in question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its purpose is purely to ensure that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people have been looked at properly, lt is of no good to say later: We made a mistake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has always been a conflict inherent in the balancing of different individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> or group <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We pride ourselves in the modern day and age in having laws that balance the various competing claims to <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill seeks to provide a way in which the Commonwealth Police in their sphere of activity will have guidelines to assist them in carrying out their duties and the public will have a much better opportunity to know their <span class="highlight">rights</span>, to be informed of those <span class="highlight">rights</span> and to have clearly defined procedures adopted in regard to interrogation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the great difficulties that we have had up till now in the law is that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of persons change dramatically at the time a police officer decides to charge a person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of such a person change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Has his attention been drawn to the report in  Travel Trade  of 7 and 2 1 March 1 977, in which the Executive VicePresident of Thai International,  Mr Neils  Lumboldt, accuses the Commonwealth Government of bias in regard to landing <span class="highlight">rights</span> by that carrier into Melbourne Airport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-30-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen),  in defence of the Government’s position on this matter, made what unfortunately was a palpably inadequate defence of Australia’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> or Australia’s capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770504_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to that section of the Bill which seeks to change the <span class="highlight">rights</span> now established before the High Court of Australia of disabled ex-servicemen to have their pensions tax free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770504_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The major thrust of the legislation encompasses the conditions and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of employees of the State railway systems transferring to the Australian National Railways Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770504_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Superannuation <span class="highlight">rights</span> and entitlements of transferring employees are set out in clause 12. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770504_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The wage employee had a seniority system which did give him some <span class="highlight">rights</span> of appeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770504_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People named Allen wished to pursue the honourable member because he was a partner and therefore personally liable for the debts of the partnership, but when they sought to pursue their legal <span class="highlight">rights</span>, which they would be entitled to do, they were met by an injunction instituted by Jamison preventing them from doing so because of the deed of arrangement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When Allen, a creditor, sought to enforce his <span class="highlight">rights</span> on the basis that Baume was different from the others, because he had said that he was not a member of the partnership and therefore Allen could attack that issue in the court, he was prevented from so doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One wonders why there is not a ban on wheat sales and other export to the Soviet Union- a nation notorious for its suppression of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, for locking up dissidents in psychiatric hospitals and harassment of ethnic groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly, although contributions to replenishments as opposed to the original subscriptions to the IDA, do not carry voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>, a small proportion of donors’ contributions is counted as a subscription. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complex calculations undertaken by the staff of IDA indicate that of the total amount which Australia is expected to make available under the fifth replenishment, an amount of only $A2 12,416 should take the form of an additional subscription with voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The major <span class="highlight">rights</span> Australia will enjoy under the Agreement are those stated in Article 6 concerning the organisation and management of the Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Administrative Appeals Tribunal was created in the time of the previous Labor Government and it gives an opportunity for citizens to establish their <span class="highlight">rights</span> as against administrative decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think that is a very important democratic way of saying that the Parliament itself is not going to be supreme in all of its actions and where there are administrative determinations and decisions, as there have to be in the normal course of events, <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be given to people in certain circumstances to say as citizens that they object to those determinations and decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When persons have <span class="highlight">rights</span> that must be adjudicated upon, a court traditionally looks at the position very carefully and in great detail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, in the more spectacular cases involving civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> or the individual’s freedom, the courts were to do anything other than scrutinise in the absolutely closest and most minute detail the entire position, there could be miscarriages of justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much of that procedure is not appropriate where we are dealing with modern legislation designed to assist to produce better social conditions for people or to put into operation policies of the Government where the individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the person concerned are very important but where it is not necessary to go into tremendous technical detail in determining , those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an action is brought against a government instrumentality in one of the courts or on appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and there is too great a degree of claiming of Crown privilege, in some cases that could impinge upon the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst the explanatory memorandum is fairly specific in pointing out that the purpose of this amending clause is to preserve the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those users of South Australian rail to any advantages that they were enjoying with freights at the time of the transfer, I draw the attention of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Has the Government yet had discussions with the States on the implementation of the obligations which come within their jurisdiction under the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, which entered into force on 23 March 1976  (Hansard,  8 December 1976, page 3560). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-57-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of  President  Carter’s statement that the ‘moral and intellectual poverty’ of cold war obsessions had led the United States into Vietnam, does the Government intend to examine its own past mistakes before developing new foreign policies based on  President  Carter’s call for a wider concern for human <span class="highlight">rights</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this Parliament and in many forums around the world, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has expressed in a most enlightened and constructive manner Australia’s approach to a whole range of issues, many of which involve the preservation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the prospects and hope for a better and more peaceful world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Commonwealth Government placed conditions on its offer of $ 10m compensation, namely that the State Government forgo its <span class="highlight">rights</span> to High Court action, and that the $ 10m is to apply to the labour content only of compensation projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-43-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second matter relates to the extension of the present provision covering false recommendations- this is section 53- to misrepresentation or false or misleading statements concerning the composition, history or previous use of goods, the price of goods or services and the existence, exclusion or effect of <span class="highlight">rights</span> or remedies of consumers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sixthly, if section 45D becomes law, not only will the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of employee organisations to represent their members be at an end, but also the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all citizens to seek betterment of their way of life will be under threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is great concern not only on my part but on the part of the trade union movement about this legislation because it does infringe upon the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of working people in this country and other countries- <span class="highlight">rights</span> that were fought for 100 and more years ago; <span class="highlight">rights</span> that people believe are entrenched. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Burke made a passionate plea about entrenched <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the infringement of entrenched <span class="highlight">rights</span> by this proposed section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it proposed to amend Pan X of the Bankruptcy Act so as to give secured creditors the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> at meetings as unsecured creditors where a deed of arrangement is proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-47-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the present law, a partly secured creditor has in relation to the unsecured portion of his debt the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> as any other unsecured creditor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-47-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fully secured creditor can, at present, exercise all his <span class="highlight">rights</span> under his security, or alternatively, surrender his security for the benefit of creditors generally and proceed as if he were an unsecured creditor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-47-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of clauses 8, 9 and 10 of the Bill is to continue the Government’s policy of expanding, wherever possible, the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to administrative decisions which affect a person’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> or entitlements under Commonwealth legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proposed new section 45D can prevent people from exercising their normal <span class="highlight">rights</span> as trade unionists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Minister should have made this amendment because all sorts of issues will arise in the industrial field as to what are the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other people in the same union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they elect to carry on in business entering into contracts of chattel hiring instead of attending to the area of money-lending and contracts of that nature, secured by chattel mortgages, then their legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be judged by the terms of the agreements they enter into and by the contract law applicable to contracts of that form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless the Government is prepared to reconsider its attitude on this provision the Minister appears to be more interested, I would think, in protecting the profits of Finance Corporation of Australia Ltd and Commercial and General Acceptance Ltd than in the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Australian public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These powers would include <span class="highlight">rights</span> of entry and inspection for consistency of product or animal against contract specifications, <span class="highlight">rights</span> to take samples for purposes of analysis, and recommending a method by which disputes relating to product standards arising between overseas buyers and Australian suppliers could be settled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part of the difficulty for a country such as Australia is to ensure that there is adequate preservation of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the zone if it is extended to 200 miles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there can be an international accord, it obviously would be more easy to preserve those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill has two main purposes: To establish a Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission to operate in conjunction with State and Territorial Legal Aid Commissions; and to provide for the preservation of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of staff of the Australian Legal Aid Office who transfer to State and territorial commissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus Part IV of the Bill seeks to preserve the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of ALAO staff who transfer to State and territorial commissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does this in 2 ways: Firstly, by requiring certain minimum terms and conditions to be included in any arrangement for the transfer of ALAO staff; and, secondly, by applying the second tier of the revised officers’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> declaration scheme to staff transferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The terms and conditions that, under Part IV, must be included in any such arrangement are the basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> to present salary, leave and superannuation entitlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are minimum conditions only and, in discussions with staff associations and the States, the Commonwealth will be seeking to have included in any arrangement the preservation of various other <span class="highlight">rights</span> such as those dealing with allowances, increments and probationary service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second tier of the revised Officers’ <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Declaration scheme is part of a proposal developed by the Joint Council of the Australian Public Service-a consultative body of staff and management- to replace the existing Officers’ <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Declaration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has said that its intention in introducing the legislation is, as it puts it, to look after the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals in unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is denying all those other workers their <span class="highlight">rights</span> if it allows this free loader in the plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other workers have <span class="highlight">rights</span> as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> is to decide with whom they will work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government wanted to protect the person who would take away the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the other workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Particular provisions are to be amended to give to individuals <span class="highlight">rights</span>  vis-a-vis  their trade union and the trade union movement generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So when we come to the companies Act and company ordinances we do not see honourable members opposite balking at the proposition that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of minority shareholders ought to be protected  vis-a-vis  the company or the board of directors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, what is all right in legislation dealing with other organisations is not all right when dealing with a monopoly organisation in the form of a trade union in which individuals have no <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet in relation to other people in the community, other organisations and bodies where minority and individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> are involved, honourable members wish and ask and by past performance legislated for harsh penalties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when we wish to treat all people equally honourable members opposite seek to deny those same <span class="highlight">rights</span> to individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made an emotional plea for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He spoke about the way in which these <span class="highlight">rights</span> are being negated or neglected by the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has told us about <span class="highlight">rights</span> which he believes are enshrined in these clauses of the Bill which are to be deleted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> about which he spoke are already enshrined in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same way that the majority shareholders he mentioned are protected by rules, so are the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual unionists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I am on my feet, I should like to say to the honourable member for Burke  (Mr Keith Johnson)  that he acknowledges that one of the fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> in our community today is the protection of the individual, and I am sure he will agree with me that one of the fundamentals of our democratic system is the right of free choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member talks about company meetings at which an individual might have <span class="highlight">rights</span> to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members on this side of the chamber have been advancing the argument that people can have <span class="highlight">rights</span> to vote but a person who has 1000 shares has no more <span class="highlight">rights</span> in that vote than a person who has one share. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we argue here today what the individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> are, that is subservient to the fact that the conciliation and arbitration system is built on the fact that there will be a trade union organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People are not free to destroy the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and conditions for which men have fought hard over a period of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a ) power to suspend, to the extent specified in the order, any of the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, privileges or capacities of the organization or of all or any of its members, as such members, under this Act or any other Act or under awards or determinations under this Act or under any other Act; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>power to give directions as to the exercise of any <span class="highlight">rights</span>, privileges or capacities that have been so suspended; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is also committed to legislating for the protection of individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the industrial area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to advise employers and employees as to their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations under the said Act, regulations, awards and orders and as to the manner in which the said Act, regulations, awards and orders should be observed; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The primary functions of the Arbitration Inspectorate are to secure, by voluntary means, the observance of relevant legal requirements and to assist employers and employees to understand and give effect to their <span class="highlight">rights</span>, duties and obligations in this respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this point I should also reiterate that the Government is committed to legislating for the protection of individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the industrial relations area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These alternative penalties would have been to suspend the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, privileges or capacities of the union, or all of a section of its members, the power to suspend a union officer or officers, power to give direction as to the exercise of any <span class="highlight">rights</span>, privileges or capacities that had been suspended and power to restrict the use of union funds or property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, the effect of the legislation was that all the members of a union or a certain group of members or some individual members could be deprived of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to hold any position in the union or to nominate for any position in the union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has withdrawn all the so-called <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals clauses, all the new penal provisions and some of the more horrendous parts of the Bureau’s operations have been withdrawn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been comments and criticisms on particular items of the legislation, on the consequences and the provisions relating to individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> in particular, and the Minister himself has acknowledged that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were very few <span class="highlight">rights</span> for employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, whilst that implies that trade unions and trade unionists have <span class="highlight">rights</span> protected by the law, it also implies that they have responsibilities and obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So a need exists to protect individual <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals to disagree with the actions which their union executive has determined the union should take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This points up the fact that, because of the size of unions and their involvement in an increasing range of non-industrial areas, individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> can be in jeopardy and they need further protection than is provided under existing legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that the Government must legislate in the area of individual <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already outlined one area in which I believe individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> demonstrably have been curtailed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All Australians who were concerned to ensure that there was a development in our industrial legislation to provide for the assertion of the public interest and the protection of individual <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and who wanted to see that achieved without massive industrial dislocation, will be pleased with the agreement that has been reached and which the Government is bringing into this House today in the form of amendments to the legislation before us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A reading of the newspapers of the Island seems to indicate that the most important thing for the Islanders is the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we hear noises from Government supporters, particularly the noisy ones, suggesting that it is a States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> measure  vis-a-vis  some mythical centralist policy that exists elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me repeat: This Bill goes against any such States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> philosophy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This concept should put to rest for ever the deception of the Fraser Government that it is a States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some who occasionally make criticisms about the work both here and in the Senate, but I assure honourable members in this chamber and I assure those people that the House is here now and will be here always as the guardian of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a matter which has been before the Parliament on a number of occasions and a number of honourable members have taken the opportunity of rather insensitively speaking about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of public servants when they go overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will stop at nothing to deny people their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and will bend the law and give instructions to public servants who are frightened to disobey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my allegations subsequently have been proved correct and no malice was intended on my part, does my experience testify to the fact that the Racial Discrimination Act can in some instances work against the freedom and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of everyone? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Later today I will be introducing into the Parliament a Bill to establish a human <span class="highlight">rights</span> commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to establish a Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major purpose of the Commission is to ensure that Commonwealth and Territory laws, acts and practices conform with the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will vest in the Commission functions under other Acts, such as the Racial Discrimination Act, relating to human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At an international level, human <span class="highlight">rights</span> issues have been and continue to be of great significance to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently we were elected as a member of the United Nations Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 18 December 1972 Australia signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span> and the Government’s aim is that Australia should ratify the Covenant as soon as this is practicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the domestic level, human <span class="highlight">rights</span> questions are obviously of concern to the whole of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both the Commonwealth and the States have their own areas of interest and it is important that there should be collaboration and co-ordination if human <span class="highlight">rights</span> activities are to be carried out in the most effective manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> which Australians enjoy should be defined in such a way by the respective governments that the people in each State and Territory have substantially the same <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not suggest that identical laws need to be formulated but a basic aim which we should have in this area is to ensure that the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> enjoyed by all Australians are substantially the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One fundamental issue which has arisen in this area is whether the protection of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> should be by way of a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the operation of section 109 of the Constitution, a Federal Bill of this kind would have the effect of introducing an entrenched Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> for the States although not, I should add, for the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would mean that all Commonwealth and State law, whether statute or common law, would have to be read subject to the Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The exercise of jurisdiction by State courts would be affected in so far as their procedures did not comply with the Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is extremely doubtful whether the confusion and friction which this would produce is justified in the public interest particularly if there are other methods available of protecting human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore I believe it is fundamental in a democracy that our basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> should be defined by Parliament and not by judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill of this character introduced by the previous Government would have left to judges a great field of judicial legislation as they defined in the judgments in particular cases the specific meaning to be given to the broad statements of principle contained in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is needed in a community such as ours is a basic commitment to human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The forces that intrude on basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> can of course be the very forces that serve the individual in other respects- the Public Service, large corporations, trade unions and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is committed to preserving human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not however agree that it is necessary to have a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in order to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does however believe that there should be administrative machinery, such as that involved in the establishment of a Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission, through which our commitment to human <span class="highlight">rights</span> can be demonstrated and constantly pursued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Government’s view, there should be a case by case approach to human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This approach would deal with areas where human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Australia are not basically recognised or which need clarification or codification or would deal with instances where it is demonstrated by the complaints of individuals that existing laws or practices fail to observe basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question might be asked whether the obligations that would be imposed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span> would require the introduction into Australian law of a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> or Bills of Right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear, I think, from the provisions of Article 2 of the Covenant that, while States Parties must provide effective and enforceable remedies for violations of <span class="highlight">rights</span> recognised by the International Covenant, appropriate measures, other than legislative measures, may be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the debates in the United Nations make it clear that judicial remedies are not necessarily the only remedies to be available for the protection of <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also important to bear in mind that there are a number of mechanisms, safeguards and procedures, both general and specific, direct and indirect, that have important implications and influences on the provision of remedies for human <span class="highlight">rights</span> of an administrative or executive character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The safeguards involved in Australia ‘s system of representative and responsible government, the independence of the judiciary and the procedures adopted by our courts, the freedom of the Press and the possibility of parliamentary or ministerial investigation or other inquiry are important factors in the maintenance of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are examples of the pressures that exist within our society to ensure that infringements of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> are provided with a remedy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, increasing attention is being given to the inclusion in legislation of qualifications and safeguards, where possibilities of intrusions into human <span class="highlight">rights</span> may arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission proposed by this Bill will play an important part in these supplementary processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Late last year I announced proposals for the establishment of a Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission as a joint Commonwealth-State venture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistently with the notion that the Commission should be established as a joint Commonwealth-State venture, I proposed that the Commission should be subject to the direction of a body, called the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Council, in relation to that pan of its work that related to the examination of State and Commonwealth laws and practices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 3 of the Bill defines ‘human <span class="highlight">rights</span>’ to mean <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms recognised in the International Covenant or in any other relevant international instrument specified by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main functions of the Commission will be as follows: The Commission will report on laws, acts and practices that may be inconsistent with the International Covenant and on laws that should be enacted or other action that should be taken by the Commonwealth in relation to human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When requested to do so by the Minister, the Commission is to report on action that needs to be taken by Australia in order to comply with the provisions of the International Covenant or any other international agreement relating to human <span class="highlight">rights</span> specified by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission is also to have functions relating to the promotion of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the coordination of programs of education and research undertaken by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides that the Commission is to inquire into and report on an act or practice that may be inconsistent with or contrary to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms recognised in the International Covenant when a complaint in writing is made by an individual to the Commission, when the Commission is requested to do so by the Minister or when it appears to the Commission to be desirable to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, where an investigation takes place on complaint by an individual it may be thought desirable to vest in the Commission conciliation functions in respect of alleged infringements of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> recognised in the International Covenant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The procedures that will be established by this BUI to be followed by the Commission will have a number of advantages, and at the same time avoid some of the difficulties, of a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the procedures will avoid the emphasis on expensive and excessive litigation that often accompanies a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The procedures will establish a yardstick against which intrusion into basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> can be measured, but will at the same time preserve the parliamentary role of determining matters of policy and settling the content of the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill will thus evidence the commitment of the Commonwealth Government and Parliament to the introduction of practical measures for the maintenance and promotion of basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the matters which I hope will be discussed is whether a declaration of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> based on the Covenant and the principles already embedded in our common law could be drawn up for adoption by all governments and parliaments in the Commonwealth and whether, based on such a declaration, a system to enforce human <span class="highlight">rights</span> can be established in every State and Territory of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, the espousal of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> can have a very hollow ring about it especially in the mouths of people like politicians, social scientists and would-be demagogues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very easy and a great satisfaction to the individual and community conscience to make lofty speeches and engage in spirited demonstrations about human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is difficult is the pursuit of those <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the benefit of the individuals for whom they are intended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The squatters, feeling they had made their stand for human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, for principle, then moved on leaving these people to fend for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time the hollowness of much that it proclaimed in the cause of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> is once more exposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What these people need is not the empty proclamation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> by radical squatters but the care of a society and individuals in it committed to the practical application of those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem of our time is not our incapacity to proclaim or understand basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is surely obvious to the most reluctant conservative that the winds of change are blowing in the trees in every field of human endeavour, challenging us all to a fresh appreciation and a stronger devotion to basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in a third area, the second manufacturer has no <span class="highlight">rights</span> whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to advise the Attorney-General as to the educational programs that would be effective in promoting an understanding by the public, or by sections of the public that have special needs in this respect, of their <span class="highlight">rights</span>, powers, privileges and duties under laws in force in Australia; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to finance educational programs and advertising campaigns that would be effective in promoting an understanding by the public, or by sections of the public that have special needs in this respect, of their <span class="highlight">rights</span>, powers, privileges and duties under laws in force in Australia; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paragraph (g) refers to research and paragraph (h) to the financing of educational programs to inform members of the public of the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, powers and privileges of which they may avail themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives the opportunity to enter into arrangements with the States as well on the condition that their commissions are representative of the same individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations that would apply under State law and State needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are dealing with people ‘s <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said at the outset of my second reading speech, the very need of these people for justice in many cases is denied because of their inability to finance their legal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a person is to be means tested out initially, that will limit any <span class="highlight">rights</span> that can be granted under any schemes in relation to which this grand Commission of the Attorney-General’s makes recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the pursuance of our own legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> we can be denied legal assistance on the basis that we are deemed to have means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great proportion of the Bill talks about protecting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of officers- the Officers <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Declaration- when they become State officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is general agreement that visible and effective independence from government at all levels is essential if legal aid services are to guarantee full and effective representation to all citizens whose <span class="highlight">rights</span> are infringed or whose interests are threatened and if salaried lawyers are to be protected against any suggestion of improper pressure or interference in their activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People felt no inhibitions about walking into the ALAO to find out whether they had any <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but they cannot get the same service if they have to walk up to some private practitioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no suggestion that in the creation of a legal aid structure we are trying to establish a monolithic creature that will deny the profession of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> as they exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that people be compelled to get legal advice before they sign away their <span class="highlight">rights</span> on documents such as a contract for the sale of land, a hire purchase agreement or a consumer credit book purchase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one goes through those clauses one finds that the existing employees of the Australian Legal Aid Office who will be transferred to State commissions will have their <span class="highlight">rights</span> protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless some agreement is reached by the Commonwealth which protects their <span class="highlight">rights</span>, those people who are transferred to State commissions will have a right to apply not for 600 positions but for only 450 positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, and fundamentally, it will preserve the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those presently employed in the Australian Legal Aid Office operation throughout Australia who transfer to State or Territory commissions and who may at some future time wish to transfer back into the Commonwealth Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the remaining time available, I wish to mention the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those people at present employed in the Australian Legal Aid Office and what will happen to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The AttorneyGeneral, who was then just the honourable member for Wentworth, went on to say that of course a Federal Parliament which passes laws creating <span class="highlight">rights</span>, duties and obligations, has a real consideration in relation to those citizens who are enforcing those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the moment, of course, there are no <span class="highlight">rights</span> possessed by anybody but the hope is that this Parliament eventually will create <span class="highlight">rights</span> for social security beneficiaries and if that does happen the enforcement of those <span class="highlight">rights</span> will become a special area of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proper course for the friends of Israel and for the Government of Australiathe Foreign Minister  (Mr Peacock)  has acknowledged that this Government follows the policy established by my Government- is to urge and encourage all the parties towards negotiations based on a mutual recognition of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of both Israel and the Palestinian people to their independence, their sovereignty and their self-determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before we make concessions to the Arabs, before we withdraw from the defensible borders that were created during the 1967 war, before we start talking about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Palestinians you show us that the Arabs and particularly the PLO are prepared to accept our right to exist and are prepared to enter into normal, peaceful relations with Israel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that there is no way in which there can be continuation of a situation of military domination that would result in the people now living in the West Bank areas being deprived of the political <span class="highlight">rights</span> to which they would be entitled, any more than anyone would want to see the people of Israel deprived of their political <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since it was first established in December 1976, the Joint Select Committee on Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in the Northern Territory held 1 1 days of public hearings- 8 in the Northern Territory and 3 in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under clause (a) of its terms of reference, the Committee was requested to examine and report on the provisions of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act relating to the identification of traditional owners of Aboriginal land and the means of establishing the views of Aboriginal traditional owners to the satisfaction of the relevant Land Councils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The majority of the members of the Committee believes that the Parliament should maintain a continuing oversight of the administration of the Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act to ensure that the letter and spirit of the Act have been observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The issue in the debate between myself and my colleague the honourable member for Hughes  (Mr Les Johnson),  a former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, and the rest of my colleagues, although not all of them, was the question of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my view that we should have conferred the ownership of the sea area, 2 kilometres from land, upon the Aboriginal people with <span class="highlight">rights</span> of access to that area coming by application to the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee has chosen to advocate that, in fact, the sea shall be more or less open with <span class="highlight">rights</span> to both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people but with absolute right of access to Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps we should actually purchase from the Queensland Government such areas as the Torres Strait Islands, Palm Island and so on, and deed that land in trust to the Aboriginal community in the same way as we are talking of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the honourable gentlemen that Woodward’s recommendations on the 2 kilometre limit was not based so much on the sanctity of the sea, but rather on the need to protect traditional fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the need to establish a buffer zone of sea in order to preserve the privacy of Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view this section of the report does not reduce Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> in respect of Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What it does is protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all people in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee was obliged to consider the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It should be remembered that the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act was drawn in order to preserve existing <span class="highlight">rights</span> and usages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> have been and will be protected through the appropriate land council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that all recommendations contained in paragraph 129 of the report quite adequately protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of traditional owners in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that this recommendation, that is to establish a committee to further inquire into the Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act, in any way presupposes the inability of the Minister to administer the Act effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also comment on the lone protest made by the genial giant of the Parliament, the honourable member for Wills who, I think, has done the cause of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> a disservice by castigating the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in such strong terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that by registering this protest the honourable member has ignored the fact that the Joint Select Committee on Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in the Northern Territory in its report, after a proper investigation, has constructively criticised the complementary legislation of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By making this protest, he has run the risk of creating greater friction between the Assembly and the Aboriginal people at a time when the Assembly has made genuine attempts to improve its complementary land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation in favour of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general, during my visits to Aboriginal communities I found that traditional owners, whilst happy to have land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, did not really see the significance of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal expectation has been raised, to the extent that he wants to know what the legislation means to him over and above the formality of receiving land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All in all, I think that the report will do much to ensure the effective implementation of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The House will appreciate that the Labor Opposition has a very sincere, genuine and enduring interest in this question of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, since it was during the period of the Labor Government’s administration that the first land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation was introduced into this Parliament and the debate continued for a substantial period, notwithstanding opposition and frustrating delays that were prompted by the then Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true, as has been mentioned, that the Joint Select Committee on Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in the Northern Territory operated diligently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not talking about general legislative <span class="highlight">rights</span>, I hasten to assure the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of Aboriginal affairs and land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, there is undoubtedly an antipathy towards the recommendations of the Woodward report on the part of dominant members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the legitimate interests of Aborigines will be protected if their traditional fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span> are preserved and their right to the privacy of their land is clearly  recognised by the establishment of a buffer zone of sea which cannot legally be entered by commercial fishermen or holiday makers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had evidence from anthropologists who stated that Aboriginals assert <span class="highlight">rights</span> of ownership over the sea in the same way as they claim ownership over their land- through myth, ceremony and sacred objects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will simply mean that, whilst the Aboriginal people will have <span class="highlight">rights</span>, they will not have ownership of those 2 kilometres offshore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal communities will have to apply for their <span class="highlight">rights</span> against the great weight of vested interests and the establishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let it be clearly understood that the honourable member for Perth, for one, is not prepared to uphold the principle that the Aboriginal people should have land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in respect of those two kilometres off-shore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I believe that the recommendation which has been made to the effect that there should be a continuing committee will have the effect of pre-supposing the inability of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  to administer the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it would be highly competent of him to do that in regard to land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, as he has been doing recently in respect of alcohol and health problems affecting Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I should like to commend the Joint Select Committee on Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in the Northern Territory on this report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At page 2 of that statement he took the Government to task and stated:   the Government saw fit to abdicate its total responsibility to the Aboriginal people and condone the proposed introduction of complementary legislation dealing with Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in the Northern Territory by the Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That statement is borne out by the introduction of many parts of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the honourable member for Hughes read this section about a buffer zone and fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I heard one honourable member in this chamber defending the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of certain railway employees to take certain action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this proposed legislation they could be dismissed instantly, with loss of all <span class="highlight">rights</span>, for taking that action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the judge of the Arbitration Commission was saying is that security of employment is basic to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of employees and that to abrogate those <span class="highlight">rights</span> by obtaining stand-down clauses there must be very substantial grounds indeed and the Arbitration Commission must be persuaded by argument that that is the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is abrogating the fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Commonwealth employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot expect to introduce legislation like that, which abrogates fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span>, without there being a reaction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It abrogates the fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Commonwealth employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been done deliberately and with a callous, cavalier and studied disregard for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Parliament and of the people of Australia who elected this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wherever anybody is employed by the Government, if it cannot bring about a confrontation by suspending and dismissing the malcontents from the Public Service with all <span class="highlight">rights</span> and entitlements deprived then it can extend this Bill to the dismissal of somebody else until ultimately it would succeed in getting that confrontation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that if it had been used at the time against the air traffic controllers there would have been a national strike for the very simple reason that the Government says in the Bill: ‘We will dictate to you where you wil work and if you will not work we will sack you and you will have not <span class="highlight">rights</span> at all’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not going to settle industrial disputes by the use of force or threats, particularly when a person’s livelihood is at stake, because immediately the sympathy of fellow workers is encouraged and they act in unison to protect that man’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> or that woman’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Employees as well as employers have <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The various postal disputes which have brought this matter to a head highlight the selfish <span class="highlight">rights</span> only’ approach of these postal workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actions of spokesmen for the Labor Party today indicate that they also are concerned only for the selfish <span class="highlight">rights</span> of these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be interesting to compare the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities, as seen by the United States postmen and postal workers, with the attitude of some of the postal workers in Australia at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The action of the Redfern postal workers today confirms this confrontation approach- the demand by them for selfish <span class="highlight">rights</span> over and above the responsibility they have to the community and to the community of interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation massively infringes the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of tens of thousands of loyal public servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During his speech the honourable member for Murray  (Mr Lloyd)  mentioned that all sections of society have both <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsinilities The air traffic controllers’ strike, and perhaps the mail strike at the Redfern exchange, are illustrations of the way in which a minority section within the trade union movement is prepared to demand its <span class="highlight">rights</span> within society, while failing to respond to its responsibilities to the rest of the people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation is designed to ensure that the ordinary <span class="highlight">rights</span> of employers and the law are applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to concentrate on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or wrongs of that case or the activities of the department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  made a speech of one and a half minutes on a matter affecting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of 400,000 Australian government employees, <span class="highlight">rights</span> which have been unquestioned for half a century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the cost of acquiring petroleum mining or exploration <span class="highlight">rights</span> or information will not qualify under the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770824_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Les Johnson)  said on 16 October 1975 in the second reading speech on the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill that: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Northern Land Council was established under the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act 1976 with the functions of ascertaining and expressing the wishes and opinion of Aboriginals living in its area, of protecting their interests and consulting with and negotiating on behalf of traditional owners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the Ranger Inquiry’s recommendations have been made on the basis that the Government’s recognition of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, through the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act, is, in the Inquiry’s words, ‘a uniquely favourable factor’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In taking its decision on uranium mining, the national park, and Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the Government has been guided by the two reports of the Ranger Environmental Inquiry commissioned under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consideration will be given to the need to amend the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act 1976 so that effect can be given to the proposal by the Northern Land Council, that Aboriginal Land should become part of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government accepts the recommendation that consideration be given to providing, by regulations, that mining companies and their contractors answer promptly any request for relevant information respecting their operations made by the Director of National Parks and Wildlife and for him to have appropriate <span class="highlight">rights</span> of inspection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My understanding of Press reports is that the ABC will no longer be broadcasting television coverage of the Olympic Games and that if it is to give any television coverage of the Games, the Commission will have to buy it off one of the private companies which has purchased the broadcasting and television <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-47-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In less than 2 years one can point to the following: The Federal court system has been restructured; there has been a fundamental revision of Federal administrative law; legal aid has been restructured in such a way as to increase cooperation with the States and to make sure that effective aid is available to those most in need; the first Ombudsman has been appointed and has commenced work; the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has been given a wider jurisdiction and has commenced operation; legislation has been introduced to reform the law on criminal investigation and to establish a human <span class="highlight">rights</span> commission; numerous references have been made to the Australian Law Reform Commission; and work is nearing completion on important new legislation on freedom of information and the use of government archives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These protections have been set out in the paper read to the House by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, and they include land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, provision of national parks and also the employment of Aboriginals in those parks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With application of the best current techniques to ensure safety for the workers, environment protection, regard for Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and an obligation to rehabilitate areas damaged by mining, one can accept the (Fox) report’s conclusion that there is no adequate reason why Australian uranium should not be mined and supplied at the world price to those countries that have elected to develop nuclear power and can be trusted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I would have thought,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  that as the guardian of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members of this House you would have accepted debate on the performance of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would suggest to the honourable member for Hotham that he not utter a reflection on the Chair regarding the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the honourable member have been defended and he knows that his <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be defended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, they were to be assisted by being informed of the many <span class="highlight">rights</span> which their new country afforded them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is the real communicator between the migrant community in that area and their <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not want someone in their midst who is able to explain the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a worker to a worker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interest of the honourable member for Melbourne in matters relating to deportation and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of migrants in Australia is not new. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, last year when the Ombudsman Bill first came on for debate in the Budget sittings the honourable member referred extensively to the power of deportation and to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of migrants under the proposed legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, he drew attention to the report of the Bland Committee on Administrative Discretions about the attitude of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of migrants in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not propose in the few minutes available to me to canvass the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or wrongs of the decision made on the environmental issue but the fact is that, as a consequence of that decision, very many Australians are suffering hardship and distress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said that  Mr Salemi  has no fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but I suppose from this Minister’s view of life nobody has any fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Funds for welfare migrant facilities and welfare <span class="highlight">rights</span> services have been reduced by 12 per cent in real terms from a miserable $800,000 last year to an even more miserable $750,000 this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that way we would also protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the original States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has also initiated a far-reaching and progressive range of legislation including the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission and Criminal Investigation Bills, has brought to fruition the Ombudsman and Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Acts, and substantive amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-45-19">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, instead, what the Fraser Government has decided to do is to rush into a decision just three months after the publication of the second Fox report and thereby to sacrifice the democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Australian people on this vitally important issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister and his Government are so keen to please the multinational uranium producers that they are not willing to allow the Australian people the chance to exercise their democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> to decide on the future of uranium mining, because of the risk of the Australian people deciding on a moratorium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me tell those men now in case they already do not know that their powers flow only from the provisions of the Local Government Act, which would never countenance their despicable behaviour in their miserable attempts to erode the democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I feel bound to point out that the whole purpose of the Government’s policy towards Rhodesia to date has been to support Western diplomatic efforts to bring about a peaceful settlement in that country, incorporating both majority rule and the protection of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the entire population of Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>There is growing stress, tension and industrial disputation in the Public Service as a result of increased work loads, loss of certain employment <span class="highlight">rights</span> and staff imbalances, and there is a reduction in the quality of services provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission Bill is a sham. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia adopted a covenant in the United Nations and said that it would ensure political and civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> to people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that State there is no equality of political and civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> such as we say should apply throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Electoral gerrymandering guarantees that people in Queensland do not have valid voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> as they should have under the civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> covenant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government introduced a Bill on the basis that there should be a human <span class="highlight">rights</span> commission, but it will be just a breeding ground for complaints and it will have no ability to correct any of the defects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the proposed commission finds something wrong in a State it will not be able to do anything but write a letter to the Premier and say that human <span class="highlight">rights</span> are not being applied there as they should be, whether they be political <span class="highlight">rights</span> or civil <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Government has adopted a cosmetic approach in setting up a commission which has no legal teeth to correct defects or to fight against the complete destruction of human and civil <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is talking about how it will support people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but it does not have the ability to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only a full, open and independent inquiry into the whole of the operations of the Deen family and Hall and the system of warrantee <span class="highlight">rights</span> over pensions can clear the air of this hideous manifestation which revealed itself in my electorate today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But whatever the nature of the majority, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual members remain protected by the charter’s emphasis on individual national sovereignty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet the honourable member has the hide and audacity to stand in the House and talk about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and wrongs of raising funds from some corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us remember that it is said that while there are federal powers to talk about custody, maintenance and property <span class="highlight">rights</span>, they are not as wide as one would think. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is a fiction to think that under the Constitution we have the power to deal with marriage- as we have- with divorce, matrimonial causes and parental <span class="highlight">rights</span> and that those powers have to be interpreted, as the High Court has legally said, but those matters are limited to the aspects of the family which I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Property questions can be discussed only if they are ancillary to the matrimonial cause and the question of parental <span class="highlight">rights</span> cannot be extended to include children who are not children of the marriage of both parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague the honourable member for Hawker  (Mr Jacobi)  will tell the House about a recent case in South Australia where the State court made a decision for the sale of the matrimonial home exercising the property <span class="highlight">rights</span> under State law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that that court ought to be the court to discuss these <span class="highlight">rights</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of property <span class="highlight">rights</span>, that is an estate in fee simple, should not be determined by a State law, as they normally would be, overriding or in any way contradicting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a wife or husband to a matrimonial home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The divorce has taken place and the former wife is facing eviction on the basis that she has no matrimonial <span class="highlight">rights</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must guarantee that these solutions are available virtually at the time the Family Court is involved in order to avoid the situation in which, although we can solve the problem of separation, the very burdensome problems of custody, maintenance or property <span class="highlight">rights</span> are not solved for a period of up to two years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important that when people can cross from State to State or State to Territory without a visa they should not have the problem of different interpretations of law when a judicial interpretation of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> is required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet at the time when Australia could have done something, when we could have given the moral support which I believe, on the basis of recent intelligence,  President  Suharto would have wished at that time, the Prime Mnister sold the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of another people to decide their future, and left in its wake the death and destruction which has fallen upon that small nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the sessional orders have been so framed that matters that affect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of any individual may continue to be debated by a Minister speaking after 1 1 o’clock, in accordance with the sessional orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We in this society are engaged in a battle for the supremacy of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people and for the supremacy of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Parliament over the abuses of power by a few officials in the union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is in fact a fight for the supremacy of Parliament and for the supremacy of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liberal and National Country parties in this Parliament are now bordering on a philosophy that would outlaw altogether the right to strike and take us back to the feudal or slave days when the basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of man were taken away from him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has said that if the Cocos (Keeling) Islands are under the control of the Australian Government it will, amongst other things, give the islanders land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Already we have foisted land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation upon various people dwelling within Australia but are now finding that the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> which were demanded ostensibly by the people concerned were not in fact demanded by them but by the organisations which were supposedly representing them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those of us who live in the areas affected find that as time goes on it is becoming obvious that the people for whom the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation was passed are not being advantaged to the degree that many people in the south and elsewhere would have wished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, I would like to see this Government not rush headlong into it in the way in which the Labor Government, and also the LiberalNational Country Party Government when it came to power, did with the Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation without getting to the grass roots and taking notice of the opinions of those people whom that legislation is supposed to benefit, the Aborigines in the spinifex and in the bough shade miles away in the sticks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for the Northern Territory referred also to the question of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the possible extension of the process of the acquisition of land in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands beyond the land required for the immediate purpose of building a quarantine station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s emasculated version of Labor’s Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill 1975 is far short of what  Mr Justice  A. E.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal Land Fund Commission was established by the Labor Government in 1974 and, pending Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation in the States, it has been a means of securing land for Aboriginal groups beyond the boundaries of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission’s work has also been hindered by the attitude of the Queensland Government and the Federal Government’s failure to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginals in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The interests and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Queensland’s Aborigines have been sacrificed for that purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Cabinet decided that written proposals for alternative uses for the land- proposals which conflict with the Aboriginal claims- should be presented to the Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commissioner,  Mr Justice  Toohey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>From discussions with people involved in the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> issue and from discussions with people in the Northern Territory, when I visited there recently to look at matters concerning Aboriginal affairs, I know that he is highly regarded for his consultative approach and his sensitive appreciation of the needs and aspirations of Aboriginal communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A halt must be called somewhere along the line because what is happening to him could easily be the first step in the erosion of the democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all Australians, which are the <span class="highlight">rights</span> that thousands of Australians went away, fought for and were either killed or maimed in supporting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without in any way attempting to downgrade Australia’s concern with human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, can he guarantee that relations with Indonesia will not be allowed to be dictated adversely by any campaign conducted in Australia in relation to East Timor? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they are not, it appears to me to be a denial of <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nor can there be any suggestion that in its operation the scheme will amount to a denial of any <span class="highlight">rights</span> which Aboriginals have as citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In considering how it would ameliorate the impact of mining on Aboriginal society the inquiry pointed out that through the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act introduced by this Government, Aboriginals were provided with a uniquely favourable factor which could be used to ameliorate and modify the impact of mining on Aboriginal society, providing Aboriginals not only with a land base but also a social base through which they could work for themselves and the Government could also work for them in co-operation with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I might say that with the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation, with the national employment strategy and with the National Aboriginal Conference and the Council for Aboriginal Development, we have made three major steps in advance of our programs for Aboriginal self-management and self-sufficiency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I well recall over all these years- since 1952 when he came to this place- his recognition of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people to express their judgment and his hope that their beliefs would see fulfilment and that they would have, as he has in common with us all, the conviction that this country will maintain its heritage and proceed into the future with a safe and secure standard of living for all of the people whom he represents, and whom I and all my colleagues on both sides of the House represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However I believe there is immense lack of dignity in the situation of half a million migrants who live in this country without the vote because nobody has bothered to go and talk to them, to explain what their <span class="highlight">rights</span> are and to help them take out citizenship if they decide they want to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why can we not have an advertising program on ethnic radio and in the ethnic Press to inform people of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and, indeed, in the electoral field, to inform people from Commonwealth countries of their obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every person is entitled to expect equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> and that the Government of the day will treat him as an Australian, not as someone belonging to a sub-standard section of the community, as is presently the case under this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Shortly after the Whitlam Government received the political count from the Australian people exercising their democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> at a free election, the Fraser-Anthony Government, in an honest endeavour to repair what in many cases was irreparable damage to Australian primary producers, as a matter of urgency extended the subsidy at the rate of $78.74 per tonne nitrogen in order to allow a close examination of the whole area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to respond to a few comments made by the honourable member for Darling Downs  (Mr McVeigh),  particularly when he challenged the Opposition to state whether it thought primary producers should have equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> with other citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This policy reflects a fundamental review of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities of the parties engaged in industrial relations and the demands of the contemporary community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the fundamental tenets of the Government’s industrial relations policy is that each member of the community has both <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">rights</span> must be protected and the obligations must be met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the principal means of giving legal expression to industrial <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While it is not, and cannot be, a complete statement of those <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations it certainly is the vehicle which establishes the framework of those <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations by defining the roles and responsibilities of the parties to industrial relations and providing for an expression of the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thirdly, the Bill proposes to enhance the means by which the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members of organisations and the interests of the community can be better protected through the functioning of the Commission, the Industrial Relations Bureau and the Federal Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It represents a necessary reshaping of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to meet changed industrial circumstances and to reassert the rule of the law in expressing or defining industrial <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a total denial of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Australian people, let alone the Parliament, for legislation of such significance to be passed through the Parliament without any real consideration by the Parliament and without any opportunity to examine the contents of that legislation being given to those who are responsible for discussion and putting an alternative point of view to the Parliament on behalf of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The truth is that many people in the Opposition know how vitally necessary this Bill is to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole essence of the legislation before us is that it is designed to protect the individual, to protect his <span class="highlight">rights</span> against arbitrary dismissal, to protect his <span class="highlight">rights</span> against arbitrary action by union officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a pity that there are some situations, particularly in States controlled by Labor governments, in which those <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals will still be in jeopardy because of the difficulties presently existing in State and Federal awards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole purpose of this Bill is not to destroy the Communist Party- would that it were possible to do such a thing- but it is designed specifically as the beginning of a number of major industrial steps to give <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedom to the individuals within those unions so that they will have the full protection of the law when and if they decide to stand up and seek office in the interests of other members of those unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the fundamental tenets of the Government’s industrial relations policy is that each member of the community has both <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations: Those <span class="highlight">rights</span> must be protected and the obligations must be met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that on reading the amendments and the legislation generally a far more compelling argument could be made that the amendments are to strengthen the role of the individual unionist and to protect his <span class="highlight">rights</span> against certain union leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are designed firstly to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual unionists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Medibank strike of last year is a perfect example of thuggery in many areas against individuals who stood up for their <span class="highlight">rights</span>- <span class="highlight">rights</span> that every Australian should have- to decide whether they should participate in a particular action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many examples of the union leadership trying to protect itself and trying to restrict the real <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms of the individual union member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the sorts of loopholes which are restricting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the ordinary unionist to participate gainfully in his union’s affairs and to get the leadership which he feels he wants and is really representative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Once again I believe that this is protecting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual unionists to see what is happening to their money and, in some cases, even from where it comes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Increasingly, it is the title deed to full citizenship, more important than a birth certificate or a passport- an identity card, in fact, the only document which proves a man exists and has <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that with these amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act we can restore some <span class="highlight">rights</span> and protection to the individual union man in this country who, I believe, overwhelmingly supports this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Like the honourable member for Murray I believe that the amendments giving conscientious objectors fuller <span class="highlight">rights</span> is sound and represents justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While it is not, and cannot be, a complete statement of those <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations it certainly is the vehicle which establishes the framework of those <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations by defining the roles and responsibilities of the parties to industrial relations and providing for an expression of the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me say quite clearly that this Government’s view is that the responsibility for maintaining surveillance of the activities of permanent building societies currently and traditionally rests with the State governments which have available specific legislation concerning the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of borrowers and lenders and the stability of building societies and the administrative machinery necessary to discharge that responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771026_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We nave seen in recent days, and particularly last week, examples of where people were not entitled to exercise their <span class="highlight">rights</span> in accordance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, that is, the right to demonstrate on any issue that they thought was proper as long as they did it in a peaceful fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw attention to the fact that the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span> has in it a number of articles which set out the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That Bill followed discussions which took place between the Commonwealth and the State Attorneys General with a view to ensuring that there would be a system of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> that would, in effect, cover all law within this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the Labor States of New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania, do not want to go with the Commonwealth into a human <span class="highlight">rights</span> commission which would be broadly based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are currently in train arrangements for discussions to take place one hopes in the reasonably near future that will lead to a more broadly based approach to human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there is one aspect at which we should be looking, and that is whether there could be evolved a declaration of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> that could be adopted by this Parliament and also by every other parliament in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will know that in Canada there is a declaration of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a good thing in this country if we were able to use the covenant on civil and political <span class="highlight">rights</span> to formulate legislation which formed the basis of a declaration of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other purpose for which such a document could be used is as a guide to human <span class="highlight">rights</span> committees or commissions which would hear applications from members of the public who claimed that in some way their human <span class="highlight">rights</span> were being infringed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the decision was one that was capable of being enforced by some order which could be registered, say, in the Federal court or some State court, a human <span class="highlight">rights</span> system could be evolved in this country which would be broadly based and effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have in mind that there could be a human <span class="highlight">rights</span> committee, for instance, established under State legislation in New South Wales- just to take an examplewhich could have jurisdiction conferred on it by a Federal Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That committee could administer a State Act and a Federal Act relating to human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By that method there could, as I say, be a broadly based situation where human <span class="highlight">rights</span> could be enforced across the board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The matter that was raised by the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott)  concerning human <span class="highlight">rights</span> interests me because the fact is that the former Attorney-General committed the Government to the establishment of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission by 1 July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former Attorney-General who preceded me in this debate had the original intention of involving the States in the preparation of this Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission and matters associated with it But it is a fact that the Premier of Queensland scotched this idea at the April Premiers Conference when he told the Prime Minister and, I think, the former AttorneyGeneral, that he would ‘not have a bar of the Commission’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission is to be based on the International Covenant on Civil and Policy <span class="highlight">Rights</span> of 1 966 which was signed by the Labor Government 16 days after taking office in December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I see it, there is a need for human <span class="highlight">rights</span> to be uniform throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that this Government puts States <span class="highlight">rights</span> before human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that under the law everybody should have the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> as those people who wish to demonstrate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the reference made to that aspect of the legislation which deals with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals in Queensland and which prevents peaceful assembly is not correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One relates to the deception of the Government in respect of Bills and issues such as human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the first signs of the deception to which I referred was the insertion of a section in the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission Act which provided that the law would come into force on a date to be proclaimed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That position is much better than the position in regard to the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the fundamental position in regard to an area of appeal in relation to human <span class="highlight">rights</span> the Government grandstands, gets the legislation through, makes a great song and dance about it, passes one Bill through both Houses, then proceeds not to proclaim it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has happened to the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission Bill? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recommend very strongly to all legal practitioners and to all litigants who are at present exercising their <span class="highlight">rights</span> under the Family Law Act that parties be not prepared to accept a decree of dissolution of their marriage until a court is also able to hear the ancillary questions of maintenance, custody and the distribution of property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we appreciate that there could be a delay of up to two years between the granting of a decree for dissolution of a marriage and the dealing with ancillary matters, we see how much the odds are in favour of a number of cases arising where divorcees will lose <span class="highlight">rights</span> they would otherwise have had to the matrimonial home and property to enable them to maintain themselves and the children of the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the Attorney-General who introduced the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> Commission Bill which is presently before the House for consideration and the freedom of information legislation which will shortly be before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why are the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a citizen in Kalgoorlie being denied and interrupted by urgent legislation from an incompetent Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one, except the National Country Party, is prepared to say that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people, the interests of people, should come before theories based on numbers and an irrational attachment to an allegedly sacred principle- a principle which, in practice, is not applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, the Federal Government is failing in its obligation to encourage Aborigines to enrol and exercise their democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any intrusion into the people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> means that the democratic principles are not sustained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every time a decision is made on a personal basis or deemed to be the prerogative of the occupant it is in our view an interference with the normal democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> that should prevail in any democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Austraha should have the same <span class="highlight">rights</span>, powers and privileges as now apply in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would not have any other force indicating that there are some divine <span class="highlight">rights</span> or a higher authority that can in any way interfere with the workings of a parliament or the life of a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see no need to retain this office as it is now occupied, because the occupant can interfere with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a Parliament or the tenure of a government and can decide whether Ministers can continue to hold office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any intrusion or action is a denial of democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an attempt had been made in Great Britain to exercise powers such as have been exercised here in recent years the British Parliament would have passed such further laws as would have even prevented the Monarch from remaining on the throne, or would have interfered with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of succession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By virtue of payment of these charges, operators of aircraft are entitled to use those areas of land within the boundaries of Commonwealth aerodromes which are available for the landing, take off and surface movement of aircraft other than those apron areas which are provided and maintained by individual operators for their own aircraft by virtue of arrangements made with the Department granting such an operator exclusive <span class="highlight">rights</span> in respect of those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-91-12">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have consistently said on this matter that Australia will meet its international obligations as determined by the Security Council, but in meeting those obligations I will not trample over the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual Australians to participate in political matters and express a particular view about Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If honourable members opposite want it bluntly, as far as I am concerned in meeting that obligation I will not jeopardise the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those people one iota. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Far from deterring opposition to apartheid, the denial of basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and Press freedom, which such measures represent, they are likely to have the opposite effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this be so and if this be a precedent, things can be done by leave of the House and members’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> can be taken away by a small minority who may be in the House at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is our protection and you are the guardian of our <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I shall indeed be the guardian of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even in the 1950s, an era of which I personally recall, they did not enjoy the normal <span class="highlight">rights</span> that the other workers enjoyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The prime motivation for the introduction of the deductibility of the sale of mining ore <span class="highlight">rights</span>, of course, has something to do with an election, particularly in the electorate of Kalgoorlie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one in those thousand was fortunate enough to find a viable ore body, then previously under paragraph 23 (p) the sale of the mining <span class="highlight">rights</span> to that ore body were exempt from taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The prospector has been able to achieve a once in a lifetime windfall reward by selling mining <span class="highlight">rights</span> to those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member would be aware, I think, of the medical examinations that are necessary, the appraisal by officers of the Repatriation Commission and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of appeal that people have to the Boards and other Tribunals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771102_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the substantial systems of examination of legislation have been developed over that time to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of minorities in this chamber, the majorities and minorities outside and the members of the Par.liament to discuss the questions before it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771102_reps_30_hor107/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What <span class="highlight">rights</span> do members of a community have in appealing against the closure of an unofficial Post Office and what form should this appeal take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771102_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recommendations have also been made in relation to access to finance, the Brisbane airport, regional routes for domestic airlines and intrastate pick-up and set-down <span class="highlight">rights</span> for longdistance coaches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The first two paragraphs of the Labor Party’s policy on uranium state that we recognise that the provision of Australian uranium to the world nuclear fuel cycle creates problems relevant to Australian sovereignty, the environment, the economic welfare of our people, and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and well-being of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The SBS will be empowered to fund its operations by the broadcasting of sponsored programs, by the charging of provisions and facilities and by the sale of programs and <span class="highlight">rights</span> or interests in programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, from the point of view of being a worthwhile addition to the existing legislation, it is quite a devastating negation of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the ordinary citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I have fairly strong feelings about ministerial <span class="highlight">rights</span>, authority and so onin certain matters I think we are in a special area when we are dealing with the control, ownership and direction of broadcasting services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, it does affect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens, and that is the most important aspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We then come to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of virtually every other citizen and the validity of the other redistributions throughout the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think this is an atrocious situation when we are dealing with the basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people and the basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people who want to represent them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could perhaps not object if it were going to be regularised as from now, but the fact that it has been made retrospective means that there will be a denial of <span class="highlight">rights</span>, particularly in Western Australia, to a constituent who established those <span class="highlight">rights</span>, I would think, by taking action in the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, you will recall that the Labor Government was anxious to upgrade the Commission, to deal not only with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States as to what money should be allocated to them but also with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Information on the <span class="highlight">Rights</span> of Staff (R.182, 185 and 187)- In its statement of 13 December 1976 the Board indicated that it supported the tenor of these recommendations and would continue to seek ways of improving the knowledge of staff in these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Existing documentation, for example the Board’s General Orders includes information on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I understand that the present Government is obsessed with State <span class="highlight">rights</span> and therefore is loth to interfere with the power of State governments in the field of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I consider, and I believe my colleagues from this side of the chamber consider, that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the children transcend any consideration of State <span class="highlight">rights</span> or anything of that order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The criticism is made, quite regularly, that when the Department of Transport has to make a decision on some aspect of civil aviation policy, whether it be landing <span class="highlight">rights</span> or something else, what Qantas says goes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Section 41 of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act requires, in effect, that m respect of Aboriginal land, a mining interest shall not be granted unless either both the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Northern Lands Council consent or the Governor-General declares that the national interest requires that the interest be granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But because authority has been granted to Ranger under the Atomic Energy Act the ‘mining interest’ provisions of the Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act do not apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore the Northern Land Council consent will not be necessary in respect of the Ranger project even if it becomes Aboriginal land under the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> claim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been a delay because the matter has to be arranged so that the Aboriginals may get their land <span class="highlight">rights</span> established and lease the land back to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When has a particular conception of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> represented the sole determinant of Australian foreign policy since World War II. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-68">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Speaker  is the embodiment of the parliament, with all its <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges and all of the trust and responsibilty conferred on it by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780221_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So we need as  Speaker  a person who can champion the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Parliament courageously and without fear or favour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780221_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today, more than ever before, the  Speaker  must champion and defend the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the freely elected Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780221_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That independence on the part of the  Speaker  is absolutely essential if the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the members of this Parliament are to be protected and, more importantly, if there is to be respect for the independence and the importance of this institution within our democratic system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780221_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the three years that you now have ahead of you, you can make a real contribution to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of members of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780221_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowing your interest, I trust you will continue during this Parliament to fight for those <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members and impress upon the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  the needs which have arisen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780221_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this day and age, with some of the problems facing this country, bearing in mind the Government’s majority I sincerely believe that there is an even greater responsibility on the Chair to ensure that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the parliamentarian are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780221_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Speaker,  I would welcome your examination of the matter and any advice or comment you feel able to give me in respect of the implication of this matter has on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless we have to protect not only the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Opposition but also the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual members of this House in grievance debates, General Business debates and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will be keeping a very close eye on things to see that those <span class="highlight">rights</span> are not submerged by the Government in any move to amend the Standing Orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a fair indication of <span class="highlight">rights</span> and truth and of what is fit, neat and proper in Australian politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We know from the experience of the last two years what is meant by this business of protecting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual unionists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I object to the Executive using the power of party discipline to force Parliament to subjugate its own <span class="highlight">rights</span> and to grovel in the dirt at the feet of an Executive that ought to be its servant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, either on the declaration of the poll or on the night of the election, when in Wills I had what might be called a handy lead, it would be said that a member was in business again and his <span class="highlight">rights</span> would be restored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the most blatant acts of hypocrisy and expediency by the Fraser Government has been its expressed commitment to human <span class="highlight">rights</span> through the United Nations Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last September the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  struck a high moral stance on human <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the United Nations General Assembly when he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our election to the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission in May of this year gives us an additional reason Tor doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a Press statement on 17 January this year the Minister reiterated these sentiments and stated that Australia would seek through the Commission the promotion of universally recognised human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in practical, effective terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s record of inaction during the last year showed that while it was anxious to strut on the international forum in espousing the cause of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> it was doing nothing to advance that cause in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The independent exercise of that power in 1975 was designed quite specifically to protect the Parliament, the authority of Parliament, and hence the authority of the people against an executive that was seeking to trample upon the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Parliament and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is legitimate for any honourable member of this House to ask: Have our individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> been eroded or ignored? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would be bad enough, goodness knows, if we were talking about just the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the average citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do we as a Parliament listening to all this talk about parliamentary privilege and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members contemplate a situation in which all honourable members representing the Government are prepared- and presumably the Prime Minister is prepared- to accept the situation in which they know that every member on this side of the House, and every Labor parliamentarian throughout Australia, has been the subject of a security dossier? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Wages, taxation, education, employment, social security and many other policies are and should be used, in the words of the Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, ‘to protect the family as the natural and fundamental group unit of society’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They deliberately use points of order as a means of stopping us from having our democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> as members of this Parliament and putting our case before the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These and other trends have made migrants particularly vulnerable as they are the persons most readily affected by economic recession yet least able to defend their interests and <span class="highlight">rights</span> at such times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps ethnic radio could assist migrants with information about their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and entitlements and in finding jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the outset we note that there will be no interference with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of the members of this House and of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I make this point only because people will be coming here to demonstrate quite reasonably in respect to their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I make the point that we want an assurance that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members and those closely associated with them are in no way inhibited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Its attitude, epitomised by the proposal to revoke the mining <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Coal and Allied Industries at the Warkworth coal deposit, is a factor that this Government has to cope with in trying to set its overall economic policy for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 22 of the Bill continues the Government’s policy of expanding, wherever possible, the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to administrative decisions which affect <span class="highlight">rights</span> or entitlements of persons under Commonwealth legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Minister may say that that is not likely to happen, I think the experience in this Parliament in the last two years has been that where circumstances have arisen where the Government has taken action, subsequently to find that it was either improper or actually illegal, this Parliament and the community have been totally ignored and their <span class="highlight">rights</span> ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some cases where people have actually taken legal action successfully they have found themselves wasting their money because retrospective legislation has been pushed through the Parliament in order to deny them the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to which the courts have said they were legally entitled under the law at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the recent Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act hundreds of miles of our northern coastline are virtually to be put under the jurisdiction of the advisers- I say that reservedly- of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister to look carefully into how this Bill can dovetail in to the Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First of all the honourable member- I think I quote him fairly accurately- referred to the need to protect in a democratic way the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people carrying out functions, presumably in these waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister will be aware from Press reports that book publishers, both in Australia and overseas, are vying for the publishing <span class="highlight">rights</span> of  Sir John  Kerr’s memoirs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The implications for civil liberties and human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this country are frightening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How far is Australia from the pro- Western terror regimes of Chile, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and other countries which curtail human <span class="highlight">rights</span> ruthlessly? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I claim to have been, during my entire parliamentary career, completely even-handed on the question of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since my election to this honourable Parliament I have been out-spoken in the defence of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> whenever they have been violated, be it behind the Iron Curtain, in Cambodia, Laos and Vietman: in Uganda and other parts of Africa- indeed wherever it has arisen throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The violation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> wherever it has occurred has provoked my spontaneous condemnation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The timing of the announcement of 20 January is beyond me although I must say in passing that I was pleased to hear the firm assurance of the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  that no deal whatsoever had been done with Indonesia over oil <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Timor Sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see the decision as a major blunder and a sad shock to all Australians who believe in fundamental human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and basic decency in international affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker,  what we do now will be judged by history and that judgment will justifiably be harsh if we fail to act with honour and a firm determination as we are put to the test and weighed in the balance on the basic and fundamental question of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe one of the inalienable <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens is to be able to contact freely their members of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apartheid, the policy of institutionalised racist domination and exploitation imposed by a minority regime in South Africa is a flagrant violation of the charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we must further publicise and oppose the repressive and disastrous features of the South African Government’s policy to help balance some of the distorted propaganda which emanates from such sources as the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in this country or such publications circulating in this country as the  South African News and Views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A government removes the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people to make decisions for themselves every time it decides that it will take money from them and determine how best to spend that money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are very serious matters which warrant the kind of security measures and the infringement upon the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members of this Parliament and of Australians to enter the parliamentary building in the course of their normal activities, that we are now witnessing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The measures are an invasion of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members of this place, and making this Parliament a fortress spectacular will do one thing: It will attract the nuts, the crackpots, the cranks and the misfits who know that any kind of an event - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am bound to say that some real progress might have been made in apprehending the culprits in respect of the Hilton Hotel outrage if our security organisations had been doing their job instead of acting as professional snoopers on people who are concerned to express their <span class="highlight">rights</span> as citizens in the community and take political positions and attitudes which do not necessarily agree with those of the government of the day or the people who adopt the standards that apply in ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, the real political repercussions of the Hilton blast, as distinct from the personal tragedy, have been the questions raised about civil liberties and individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> through the gross over-reaction of the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has his attention been drawn to recent statements of the Queensland Premier that moves for land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the States, as implemented in the Northern Territory, could lead to a black takeover backed by communist countries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government take steps to implement Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> throughout Australia, or will the Government continue to defer to the States which prefer to subject Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> to mineral exploitation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These conditions related to proliferation, terrorism, safeguards in relation to nuclear weapons, the existence of proven safe ways of disposal and/or storage of radioactive wastes, environmental concerns and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The emphasis is to the effect that safeguards are effective, that the problems of disposal have been solved, that the environment is safeguarded and that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wish to stress this aspect, particularly as it relates to Aboriginal affairs and Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Outside the Northern Territory and other Federal Territories, the Government today has washed its hands of any responsibility for land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In reply to the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Dawkins)  this morning, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  said that land <span class="highlight">rights</span> is a matter exclusively within the jurisdiction of the State Government operating under its own legislation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without consulting the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> body in Western Australia and without consulting the Commissioner for Aboriginal Planning, the Western Australian Government intends to hand over to the Minister for Health and Community Welfare the absolute control of entry by diamond prospectors, including the De Beer group from South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can imagine what sort of cognisance he will take of Aboriginal feelings and sentiments when it comes to consulting people on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of entry of mining prospectors to their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the 1975 election campaign we were assured by the parties now in government that they intended to implement Federal policy on Aboriginal affairs, to implement Federal policy on land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and to implement the recommendations of the Woodward Commission and the Ranger Committee of Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We saw some outstanding examples of this when the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill was introduced by the Labor Government, and, later, by the Liberal-National Country Party Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The thrust of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act is now being felt and it is now becoming apparent that it cuts across the understanding of the traditional Aborigines about their land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The main thrust of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act was for large land councils and it was completely wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The F1 9 or Eastern Freeway experience totally makes nonsense of this Government’s commitment to devolution, to asserting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of local government and to conserving the social environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Suffice to say that the field of transport is a rich field for a government which wishes to confront the problem of unemployment, which wishes to raise productivity and which wishes to provide a proper framework for an industry to plan and to protect and to enhance people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> as citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, the Government would begin to make possible affirmation of <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those people who have been victimised by past policies and who are very often being denied the most basic of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister now accept that many of the accusations levelled against Israel at international conferences regarding its practices in occupied territories should not be regarded so much as human <span class="highlight">rights</span> issues but as Middle East issues, recognising that Israel has been subjected to hostilities on a continuing basis for many years from neighbouring countries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs says that he has no legislative power with which to override Queensland in the matter of negotiating mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span> or the takeover of the administration of the missions on these Aboriginal reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the responsibility of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to check the insane attitudes of the Premier of Queensland who is talking of abolishing land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, restraining all possible land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aboriginals on the ground that this could lead to a black takeover in Queensland with the assistance of communist governments overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reference I made about the recognition of the fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines to retain their racial identity and traditional lifestyle also affects another situation at Aurukun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The announced action of the Premier of Queensland in my view is a blatant violation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and a violation of the will of the Aboriginal people- indeed that of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask him to seek a more positive response from this Government which since 1976 has hardly been in the vanguard insofar as the introduction of progressive legislation and the taking of action to safeguard Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When will this Government uphold the International Labour Organisation and United Nations conventions with regard to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of indigenous people insofar as land and other matters are concerned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When will this Government formulate investment policies which will prevent the violation of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When will the Government exercise its constitutional power and legislate more effectively to protect Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first plank of such a policy in respect of Cape York ought to be the protection of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should have been acting as a watch dog for the Aboriginal people when this assault on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aurukun people took place back at the end of 1975 and the beginning of 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two questions are involved- the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people at Aurukun and the foreign investment policy of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great game of table tennis is going on at present and has been going on since this Government took office, but the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of mining companies seem to go unfettered at the expense of those of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Queensland Government infringed United Nations and International Labour Organisation conventions regarding the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of indigenous people in respect of their traditional lands, particularly the right to be consulted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Act concerns primarily the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this great consortium made up of Tipperary Corporation, an American land developer, which has 40 per cent of the shares; Billiton Aluminium Australia, a subsidiary pf Royal Dutch Shell, which has 40 per cent of the shares; and Aluminium Pechiney Holdings Pty Ltd, an offshoot of the French Pechiney group, which has 20 per cent of the shares. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are unable to exercise their normal <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the Federal Government is tame and afraid to stand up to the State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we go back briefly to the question of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> it will be seen that we have no appropriate Federal legislation because the Premier of Queensland said to the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  that he would not have a bar of that legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore people in Queensland who want to exercise their <span class="highlight">rights</span> are gaoled if they demonstrate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real purpose behind removing the control of the Church and affecting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of these people is to grant mining leases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives them no <span class="highlight">rights</span> at all and I am advised by my colleague that the Queensland Government is prepared to give <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the freehold title of part of that reserve to the mining company concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, under the power that has been exercised already, <span class="highlight">rights</span> are vested in the Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are <span class="highlight">rights</span> of residence and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of conduct- in other words, normal <span class="highlight">rights</span> that one would expect to be given to anybody who is almost an owner of the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what the Government must do to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been made clear by concerned people that unless the Government does this it will be denying these people their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we talk about responsibility to the Aboriginal people we mean responsibility to protect them, to give them their <span class="highlight">rights</span>, to give them ownership of their land and to give them their entitlement to the profits therefrom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely when State administration came into being there was an obligation upon the States to respect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation deals with their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and entitlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Considerable hardship would be created in some cases if the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of employees entering the service of the Commission now were not to be continued in the way they had in the past and in the manner on which they had planned their activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some honourable members might be interested to know why we are speaking on this Bill which prima facie appears to deal with the entitlements and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of South Australian Railways employees who have now transferred to the ANRC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To honourable members who query why I am speaking at all on this Bill let me simply say that the very <span class="highlight">rights</span> of South Australian railwaymen which are protected under this legislation have already been taken care of in respect of Tasmanian railwaymen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bill makes provision for protecting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of former South Australian Railways employees who are transferred to the Australian National Railways Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The main provisions in this Bill relate to the superannuation and compensation <span class="highlight">rights</span> of former South Australian Railways employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, this Bill makes provision for the long service leave and workers compensation <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the railway employees transferring from those State railway services to the Australian National Railways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I might mention that if the right honourable member for Bruce is to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual members of this House he should cease making the very heavy imposition that he has made on the research services of the Parliamentary Library, especially the legal research service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is five years since the Labor Government appointed a Royal Commissioner to look into land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind honourable members of the fate of the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation which was passed by this House and which was then sent to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If Government supporters think that acting after 21 years or 1 1 years or five years is acting too quickly, they might turn to the prescriptions of George III- not a notable revolutionary- who set out in 1763 the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Indian people to the lands of Northern Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat that it stated there would be no peace with Israel; no negotiations with Israel; no recognition of Israel; and no abandonment of Palestinian <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question of my <span class="highlight">rights</span> as a member of this place- they are no greater and no less than the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other members- has been raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With great respect to you, sir, it is your prerogative and your duty to uphold those <span class="highlight">rights</span> and to uphold them in terms of the traditions of the Westminister system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that whatever security measures have to be taken ought to have full regard to the very important privileges and <span class="highlight">rights</span> that are attached to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am fearful that we may allow those <span class="highlight">rights</span> to be eroded, with the best of intentions and with the best of attitudes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">rights</span> had to be fought for over many years and over many centuries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision of information to citizens of Commonwealth countries, including those from Cyprus and Malta, who are now living in Australia is tied in with a general campaign by the Australian Electoral Office to inform eligible voters of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-57-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Government would do a great service to all contributors if it took the trouble to explain more fully to them what it is doing and what their <span class="highlight">rights</span> are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will he take some substantive action in this case to support his statement to the United Nations General Assembly of September 1977 that Australia takes human <span class="highlight">rights</span> seriously and without action talking of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> is wasted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-42-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The task force was charged with the responsibility of investigating the allegations, keeping firmly in mind the traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span> and traditional movements of people from Papua New Guinea in the Torres Strait area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also want time to incorporate in the legislation not just land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the taking over of reserves, but also a stronger control of reserves by the Aboriginal and Islander people of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the Bill does not provide, as some of the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation for the Northern Territory provides, that no person, not being an Aboriginal or Islander, shall enter a reserve without permission of the Aboriginal council or without the consent of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second reading speech of the Minister refers to land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet land <span class="highlight">rights</span> have been the cry right from the days of the first dawning of a national voice for Aboriginals in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Land <span class="highlight">rights</span> virtually are ignored in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is concerned at the very tame approach to land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely, with all the glowing praise for land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation in the Northern Territory in the recent address by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to the National Aboriginal Conference and with the Minister’s own praise for land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Western Australia, we could at least have hoped for some foreshadowing of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Meanwhile, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginal people in Queensland continued to be violated by official Queensland Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975 we gave Aborigines <span class="highlight">rights</span> over their properties, we ended wage discrimination, we established their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to have legal representation in courts and we ended the odious permanent entry system onto reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The authority of that legislation, in conjunction with the Racial Discrimination Act of 1975, the Aboriginal Land Fund Act and the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act of 1976 gave the Government, if those authorities were taken up, a great deal of clout in its relations with the Queensland Government in the matter of Aboriginal welfare and <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation now is the product of a fickle Government commitment to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginal people in the face of bluster from the Queensland Premier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Prime Minister was giving those assurances his representative in Aboriginal welfare matters, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner),  was going about the community conveying the impression that he was an unyielding, dedicated defender of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would have given Aboriginal people land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and they would have ended the sweeping, intrusive and coercive powers of the Queensland Director of Aboriginal Affairs- powers, intrusive and coercive in their nature, which no white person would tolerate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It is in conflict with the basic principles of so many international conventions which this country has signed upholding human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, human dignity and self-respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Eighteen months ago the Prime Minister gave a secret assurance to the Queensland Premier that there would be no land acquisitions for the purposes of establishing land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aboriginals in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that if we put to the Aboriginal people that the question was whether we provided land and total land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Queensland, acquired all the reserves on just terms, that is, paying out that money for those <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and lost ali their other programs throughout the rest of Australia- housing programs, education programs, health programs- they would say responsibly that they would wish to see the maintenance of those programs which would be to their immediate benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was the failure of the Northern Territory Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation to face up to the issue and place on the Legislative Assembly in the Northern Territory the responsibility finally for many areas which are of some importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can say only that it has been the intention of the Opposition in moving these amendments to strengthen the Bill in order to give effect to the Government’s announced intention to strengthen the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the prerogatives of the Aboriginal people in determining their own future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only arguments that have been advanced as to why we have to curtail our <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this matter is that the Minister does not trust Bjelke-Petersen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In terms of civil liberties we have enacted much legislation- for example, legislation to establish the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal- to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals against a large and sometimes seemingly all-powerful bureaucracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The anxiety that the establishment of separate local government bodies might be in the Government ‘s mind and that it might lead to what has variously been described as separate development, the creation of semi-autonomous Aboriginal entities and /or an encroachment on State <span class="highlight">rights</span> under the federal system has occasionally been expressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose an argument could be developed, if we recognise de facto one government’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> over a piece of territory, although we are not going to the extent of recognising de jure that government’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> we are by implication obliterating our de jure recognition of the former government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe the question which people listening to this broadcast, and indeed honourable members in this chamber, will ask themselves is: Does this Bill cut across any of our traditional Australian liberties and <span class="highlight">rights</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As was said elsewhere, and I think said well: ‘The <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of members of parliament are peculiarly matters for the Parliament to consider and there should not be an infringement of these <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges, whatever that infringement might be, without proper consultation and discussion with the members of the Parliament’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are in great danger in this House of drifting into a situation whereby the incantation of the word ‘terrorism’ will serve the coalition to stifle <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties, even <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of members of this Parliament, just as the incantation of the word ‘communism’ was used in the 1950s and 1960s to stifle <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It could have been applied with considerable effect in Queensland to establish and preserve the basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginal people in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of that, not only was the authority under the Racial Discrimination Act not adopted but also the evidence is that the Minister prevented it from being adopted in defence of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By itself that might not have seemed so significant, although it is certainly worrying; but in association with other matters for which the Minister has been responsible, clearly what he was seeking to do was to impose a fiscal discrimination, a fiscal prohibition, on the Land Fund Commission which was very rightly seeking to exercise the authority available to it to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginals in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, the evidence of the letter makes it clear that despite the undertaking that the Prime Minister gave that there was concern- by implication, that the Government was still committed to achieving land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aboriginals in this area- when he said to the Parliament that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs was still considering what steps to take on the matter, he had no intention of considering the matter further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the policies- policies of assimilation, policies of restriction and policies designed to prevent the Aboriginal people from establishing a clearer sense of cultural identity and the achievement of land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, freedom and independence; those things which importantly go with acquisition of land and land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but more importantly for Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He expressed concern about racism and yet he erected fiscal barriers to ensure that the Land Fund Commission would not be able to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginals in Queensland against the incursion of the racist policies of that State Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The penalty it is going to pay arises because it is not prepared to stick to the elaborate fiction that the Minister likes to broadcast that we have a government concerned about Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> and welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real reason for this is that the Queensland Government asserts that it is opposed to Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> because it believes that it leads to a dispersion of Aboriginal residents in mission areas and, presumably, it is not able to impose as much control as it would wish over Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a complementary vehicle for giving effect to a land <span class="highlight">rights</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seeks to strike down the very abuses of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, of which the honourable gentleman spoke- the discriminatory actions and legislation of the Queensland Governmentbut it does it in such a way that it creates a right in the hands of any Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander in Queensland to protect himself against discrimination by reason of the provisions of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Generally, the Government has supported the view that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of taxpayers under existing legislation should not be altered retrospectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Depending upon the recommendation of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner and my consideration of his report, there will be opportunity for this land to become Aboriginal land within the meaning of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inquiry recommended in chapter 14 that the Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act be amended so as to move the southern boundary of the Ranger project area, as delineated in Schedule 2 of the Act, further away from the Aboriginal sacred sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effects of this practice were not taken into account in the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inquiry, by recommendation 14.2, recommended that section 40 ( 1 ) of the Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act should be amended so that the prohibition against granting a mining interest without consent should certainly include the common case of mining leases being approved by the Administrator, but not formally granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  has already indicated that the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act will be amended to provide for the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service to have appropriate <span class="highlight">rights</span> of inspection and information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill seeks similar <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the Northern Land Council, as recommended by the inquiry in recommendation 18.2 (s). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have already indicated, the opportunity is being taken to seek further amendments to the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principal Act provides for the closing of the Aborigines Benefits Trust Fund which was established under section 21 of the Northern Territory Administration Act and for it to be replaced by an Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account to be established under section 63 of the Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will be aware that the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act provides for the creation of additional land councils under certain circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my second reading speech to the Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act in 1976, 1 said that the Government believed that the Act would allow and encourage Aboriginals in the Northern Territory to give full expression to the affinity with land that characterised their traditional society and gave a unique quality to their lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware that moves by Aboriginal people to assert their <span class="highlight">rights</span> as provided by the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act have caused some people to become wary and even fearful of the new situation which now prevails. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act is a unique and historical piece of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments which are now being placed before the House are designed to give further effect to the Government’s policies in relation to Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and to allow Aboriginals, as I said in my statement to the House on 25 August last year, as owners of their land, to follow their own lifestyles on their own land to the extent that they choose, to participate in and influence the course of development of and on their traditional land, and to take advantage of the full range of opportunities which development may open up to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I expect that negotiations on this matter, as required by section 44 of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act, will be resumed shortly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a strange inversion of argument to defend an indefensible policy by drawing attention to the biggest crime of all, that is this irreversible sellout of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> not only of the citizens of Manly- Warringah but also of the countless thousands of Sydneysiders from all over the metropolitan area who travel to the northern beaches and waters for their recreation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the proposed meeting between the Australian Government and the representatives of the Queensland Government on the matter of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginals on the Aurukun and Mornington Island reserves which was supposed to occur today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What options are available to the Government to guarantee the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of exporters to export? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the Government has failed to take sufficient lead in working out a National Information Policy, that is, a comprehensive outline of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australian residents and citizens to access to information in a form which can benefit them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yugoslavia, although it is said to be developing human <span class="highlight">rights</span> programs, is still a communist country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a progressive deterioration of our <span class="highlight">rights</span> and our tendency to protect our <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The agreement and the position into which that agreement puts the Commonwealth make it quite certain that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and prerogatives of the Aboriginal people  of those two communities can and will be safeguarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government to introduce legislation to give the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in accordance with the principles already established for Aboriginals in the Northern Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, did any discussion take place on the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> question during the recent meeting with the Premier of Queensland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, I will be working in the closest consultation and co-operation with the Queensland Government to see that the terms of that special lease adequately secure the tenure of the people in those two places for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of occupation and use which they previously enjoyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he agree that self-management without land <span class="highlight">rights</span> is a mirage and that rnining is the greatest and most constant threat to their social stability? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The relationship between the special lease and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to use and occupancy which that gives to the mining interests already established on the former reserve is, of course, a matter which the Commonwealth will keep under the closest consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How soon will he answer the three questions that I put on the Notice Paper six weeks ago about his earlier correspondence with the Premier on Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also ask whether the Government has under consideration the restoration of the right of officers of the military forces to direct appeal to the GovernorGeneral not while making similar <span class="highlight">rights</span> available to non-officer ranks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As citizens they have their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 8 of the Bill continues the Government’s policy of expanding, wherever possible, the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to administrative decisions which affect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or entitlements of persons under Commonwealth legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When in 1955 Australia extended the Convention of the World Meteorological Organisation of 1 1 October 1947 to the Australian Antarctic Territory the United States Government notified the Australian Government that ‘it does not recognise any claims so far advanced in the Antarctic and reserves all <span class="highlight">rights</span> accruing to the United States out of activities of nationals of the United States in the area ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister is also very concerned that people do not see any move by the Federal Government to give self-management to Aboriginal communities as being some kind of separate development, as being the creation of a semi-autonomous Aboriginal entity, or as encroaching on State <span class="highlight">rights</span>, whatever they may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought we were talking about human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that in this case the Minister is giving priority to State <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is not concerned with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginals or of Australians but with State <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He hopes thereby to quell any disquiet, any complaint, any demur by the people of the Aurukun and Mornington Island reserves in particular so that he and the Premier of Queensland and his Ministers can in some way wriggle out of any intrusion by the Federal Government in its responsibilities for Aboriginal affairs, Aboriginal self-management and Aboriginal self-determination, into the sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the State to control all local government matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The powers that were spelt out in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-Management) Act, which was passed last week ostensibly for the purpose of overcoming the intrusion of the State into the legitimate <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines to determine their own rate of acculturation into the western culture, are identical to those spelt out in the 1976 Act which deals with Aboriginal councils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Government has never accepted the concept of land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hitler decided that all Jews did not have the right to life and so they were disposed of, with even less <span class="highlight">rights</span> than animals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, of course, in Australia today the father has absolutely no <span class="highlight">rights</span> at all and has absolutely no say in whether his unborn baby will live or die. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have heard arguments over the years about women’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> and all sorts of <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have a situation where a man exercises his <span class="highlight">rights</span>, pursuant to the law made in this Parliament and available to him, and wins his appeal but apparently, because he has won the appeal, that again has created a further stigma or suggestion that this man is going to beat this bureaucracy which is trying to declare him to be unfit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A reading of these will show that whilst the coastal State has sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> over the living resources of the zone it has, in turn, certain obligations with respect to management of the resources in that zone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Joint Committee of the two Houses of this Parliament that will shortly examine this subject should look with care and with a view to obtaining some guidance, at the system used in the Canadian Parliament where the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges belong to both Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the sooner we establish our <span class="highlight">rights</span> granted and guaranteed to us in the Constitution, the better will be our relations with the media and the better will be our relations with the public outside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many instances of local authorities approving planning schemes for the development of urban areas around the country which, at this stage, ought to be making allowances for <span class="highlight">rights</span> of way for the use of personally automated transportation, whether or not they are similar to  Mr Loder  ‘s scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I strongly suspect that the issues involved are not of concern at all to any Territory government but of concern purely to the governments of the States of Queensland and Western Australia which seem to be suffering from an embattled complex- a complex that they have been beleaguered in some way by the Federal Government, that they have to stand up and struggle for their threatened State <span class="highlight">rights</span> so called. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments are all concerned with States <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In support of my contention that this is not a move by the Territory authorities but is purely a move by the States of Queensland and Western Australia which are so vocal on this matter of States <span class="highlight">rights</span>, let us look at some of the provisions of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act 1976, the complementary and consequential legislation for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recognising land <span class="highlight">rights</span> we will ensure: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That traditional Aboriginal owners gain an inalienable title to their land, that they also determine how their lands are to be used and preserved, that they have the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> as any other owner to determine who enters their land whether the person is Aborigine or non-Aborigine . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the document contained the statement that I have just quoted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are, as the honourable member for Dundas  (Mr Ruddock)  indicated by way of interjection, certain provisions for other people to give  the  <span class="highlight">rights</span> of entry to Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister should take account of this reaction if he really means what he says, that is, that he is acting for the Aboriginal people and not for States <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the incidents that makes us particularly uneasy about this defence of States <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the falling in with the wishes of the states occurred in Mareeba in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would act as trustee until the future establishment of an Aboriginal housing society in which the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities would be then vested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that they represent a holding operation which is the sort of caution we think the Minister should have before he strengthens the position of the States in these matters and certainly which he would be ill advised to ignore before he has had the fullest consultation with the Aboriginal people, the land councils and other bodies, as the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly did before it brought down its land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The readers of  Hansard  and the listeners to this debate could be forgiven for being confused about the purpose of the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Amendment Bill because what they heard was a speech about Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It says nothing about Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was never intended to say anything about Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The original Act dealing with Aboriginal Councils and associations said nothing about Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the amendments proposed by the Opposition tonight say nothing about Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That proposed new sub-section makes it clear that when the Act is amended the existing <span class="highlight">rights</span> of local government authorities will be taken into account and not just if there is a proposal to extend local government to that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that is an unnecessary curtailment of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people to form an Aboriginal Council even though a local government exists in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Prime Minister indicate in the firmest terms that this legislation is thoroughly unacceptable and further indicate to the Parliament what steps the Government has in mind and when it can make a full statement to the Parliament as to what action it will take to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginal people at those two places? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would draw the honourable member’s attention to subsection 44 (2) of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act which provides for an agreement to be entered into between the Commonwealth and the Northern Land Council concerning terms and conditions for mining in the Ranger project area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any proposed changes would of course take full account of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and welfare of the employees involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has any action been taken by the Government to ensure that authorities do not abuse the basic civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people concerned in these inquiries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any action has been taken to protect their civil <span class="highlight">rights</span>, can he indicate to the House what it is? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if in the pursuit of such breaches there is any evidence of undue activity in one area or any suggestion of a denial of proper civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties then I would certainly want to be given examples and that matter would be pursued quite vigorously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Part IV of the principal Act normal civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> are proscribed in respect of access to information, search and arrest, proof of intent and access to declared areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, there might be conflict between Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and provisions of this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We thought it a most inappropriate bit of legislation, not only due to its penal clauses and its infringement on human <span class="highlight">rights</span> but because it would also be used to maintain conflict by this blanket of secrecy which has dogged the whole process ever since it started. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Territory Supreme Court legislation, the Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation and many other moves are all important factors that fit together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The several areas that the Opposition is concerned with are environment, Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, radiation hazards, nuclear explosions, terrorist activity and waste disposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, I do not have enough time to cover the matters of the environment and Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but I will deal with some of the other matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government does not care that the Marcos regime, with which it is making bilateral arrangements, has already demonstrated total disregard not only for the protests of people of the Philippines who live near the reactor site but also for the democratic and constitutional <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the entire population of that nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor people will not be satisfied with some shifty footwork by the Government on Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> or so-called safeguards against proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By conducting uranium mining under the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act the Government has the power to deny ordinary industrial <span class="highlight">rights</span> to workers and unions associated with the mining, handling and transportation of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Act denies basic civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> to any persons, including workers and union members, who hinder uranium mining in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All told, the use of this piece of legislation to cover commercial uranium mining ventures in a climate of growing public hostility to uranium mining and export, poses a serious threat to civil liberties and to the industrial <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a significant section of the Australian work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at some aspects of the legislation as it affects States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not heard a word from the Premier of Queensland about this legislation, which guarantees that no State’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be permitted to interfere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would be no question of State <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Commonwealth enters the field and covers it, no States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> are left in that field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Normal democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> such as freedom from arbitrary arrest, unwarranted search and seizure, and the presumption of innocence are thrown out the window. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Deputy Leader’s last references to State <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the federalism policy seemed to me to be almost absurd and purely political in their substance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall confine my remarks in this debate to the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1978, which is not as memorable as the principal Act of 1970 which it proposes to amend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They want some action on land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that if honourable members were to give their attention to this proposal they would see that it can do nothing for Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  second reading speech might be summed up by saying that it claims that the legislation is designed implement land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aborigines and to tidy up a few machinery matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill does not represent just an amendment of existing legislation; at the same time it represents an abridgment of land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This trend is not so dangerous in this Bill that all Aborigines will rise up in indignation as they certainly did, for example, concerning the recent shameful legislation introduced by the Queensland Government concerning Aurukun and Mornington Island which firmly denies land ownership and mineral and quarrying <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Aboriginal shires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are very severely limited as to time, but I seek the Minister’s assurance, if he can give it- I trust that eventually he will- that he will include the Gimbat and Goodparla pastoral leases, as recommended by the Fox report, in the Ranger uranium areas in the Alligator Rivers region, or that he will in some way include those leases in the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is intended to give effect to the Government’s decisions on the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry as far as they affect Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have indicated these are aimed at uranium export first, not Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has moved with reasonable and commendable promptness on this, as it did in relation to the original Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act, to see that land <span class="highlight">rights</span> are given to Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This is a very important Bill because it will enable the Government to proceed expeditiously with the implementation of some aspects of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act which have not been capable of implementation to date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that this legislation was a landmark and I am very pleased to be a part of the Government that brought legislation in this form into effect and gave land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill is designed to provide for the adjustment of the southern boundary of the Ranger project and to provide for environmental information and inspection <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the Aboriginal Northern Land Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is important because it seeks to protect the interests of the Aboriginal people who live in the region and whose <span class="highlight">rights</span> are affected by uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reference was made by the honourable member for Cunningham  (Mr West)  to the specific provisions that I have mentioned briefly relating to the provision of environmental information and also the inspection <span class="highlight">rights</span> that the Northern Land Council will enjoy as a result of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we give <span class="highlight">rights</span> to people to go in and to inspect other people’s records and activities and when we give them the right, as is to be given under the Environment Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Bill which is part of this cognate debate to be able to go to the court to protect those <span class="highlight">rights</span>, there is no doubt in my mind that provision must be made to ensure that information that might be gained but which perhaps is not relevant will not be divulged willy-nilly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt in my mind that, when we provide for a new situation in which information can be obtained- and it is very broad ranging information- and when we provide for a proper forum in which that matter might be reviewed, as we have in the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill that we are debating tonight, those people who receive that information are required to act responsibly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conjunction with the amendments to the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Amendment Act we are debating the Environment Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would be feasible, however, is a simple amendment to the law to provide for a right of appeal to a court, which amendment would not only safeguard Latham’s democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> but also the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of others who may find themselves on the receiving end of union muscle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, Latham’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> are representative of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all Australians, <span class="highlight">rights</span> that Parliament is duty bound to protect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely then the New South Wales Government exists to protect the democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of its citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Parliament to give serious consideration to this matter and to remember that we are dealing with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of a group of people who are just as much part of Australia as we are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Question 834) <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of urgent pressures from other Departments for conclusion of agreements between Aboriginal and mining interests, when does he expect to make public details of Government policy on Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s policy on Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> has been clearly stated, particularly in my second reading speech on the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and my statement of 23 August on the Government’s uranium decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That a select committee of this House be established to inquire into and report on extending and guaranteeing Aboriginal voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations for the Federal, State and Territory Parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 19 October 1961 the House of Representatives ordered the printing of a report of its then select committee inquiring into the voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee then asked the superintendent at Cherbourg to circulate to the residents a document setting out their voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most New South Wales Aborigines were exercising their long-established voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Electoral Office was asked to have service and exservice personnel informed of their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They had to get a ticket exempting them from the jurisdiction of that Act in order to have many of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens that the rest of us enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was probably with good reason, because after all, as I have already stated, no one had taken the trouble to explain to these people their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet this sort of shameful interference with the democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginal citizens to enrol and to vote goes on with impunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Papua New Guinea has shown us how illiterate peoples can be made aware of voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities and how voting procedures can be simplified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion that has been moved in this notice is that a select committee of the House be established to inquire into and report on extending and guaranteeing Aboriginal voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations- I emphasise the word ‘obligations’- for the Federal, State and Territory parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that Aboriginals have voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that there is no question of extending those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also a fact that in recent experience in the Northern Territory, in both Federal and Territory elections, it has been shown that the existing procedures are adequate and that there is a very high degree of awareness amongst members of the Aboriginal population of their voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are being educated progressively how to exercise those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are after is that the political activity of the Aboriginal people and their political <span class="highlight">rights</span> be guaranteed by a program of education, enrolment, and so on, to ensure that when elections are held, the Aboriginal people take their place in the community as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, taken together, they deal with the need to make an early start on the mining and development of our uranium resources, whilst at the same time ensuring adequate protection of the environment of the Alligator Rivers Region, protection of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and legitimate interests of the Aborigines in the region, protection of the safety of persons engaged in the uranium industry, and the development of adequate safeguards to prevent proliferation of the nuclear armament industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in this Parliament have a responsibility to Australia and the rest of the world to develop our uranium resources as speedily as possible, subject, of course, to essential safeguard provisions, reasonable environmental and safety considerations and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and interests of the Aboriginal and other inhabitants of the areas where the reserves are located. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its main objectives are to facilitate the creation in two stages of the Kakadu National Park and at the same time enable it to be convened to Aboriginal land under the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act  1 976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Claims under the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act will increase that area quite considerably. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The national Director is to have the right of access to any area in the region and the right to require information, with power to apply to the Supreme Court to enforce his <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>After sub-section (2) of proposed section 8C insert the following sub-section: (2a) A township shall not be established or developed by the Director on Aboriginal land except after consultation with the Aboriginal Land Council established under the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act 1976 for the area in which the land is situated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The effect of our amendment, if it were adopted, would be that a township could not be established or developed by the Director on Aboriginal land except after consultation with the Aboriginal Land Council established under the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act 1976 for the area in which the land was situated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Director may, for the purposes of Part II of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act 1976, surrender to the Commonwealth any interest held by him in respect of land within a park or reserve within the Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposed amendment, if adopted, would require the Director to relinquish to the Commonwealth any interest held by him in land in a park within the region for the purpose of Part II of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where, in respect of Aboriginal land wholly or partly within the area for which an Aboriginal Land Council has been established under the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act 1976, being an area wholly or partly within the Region, a difference of opinion arises between the  Chairman  of that Council and the Director as to whether the Director is performing his functions or exercising his powers in accordance with a plan of management, the Minister shall appoint a person, being a person whom he considers to be in a position to deal with the matter impartially, for the purposes of sub-section ( 3 ). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition believes that there are already adequate safeguards for individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> in court procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that this clause makes an unnecessary and unwarranted intrusion into those <span class="highlight">rights</span>, if in the administration of those lands we are really interested in Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and Aboriginal priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advice received by the Government is that the Opposition’s proposal is unnecessary because the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill will require the relevant Aboriginal land trusts in the region to enter into leases with the Director of National Parks and Wildlife. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I rise on this issue because the Government has proclaimed itself as the guardian of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States and it has said that the Opposition is not terribly concerned about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We regard it as quite undesirable that legislation, which could potentially be used against States ‘ <span class="highlight">rights</span> and civil liberties in unspecified circumstances, should be passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This legislation can override their powers and their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am simply saying that where those anxieties exist, in my view if a government proclaims to be concerned about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States and proclaims to be concerned about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual against what it epitomised as an over-centralised Labor Government then proceeds in this fashion in the face of those objections, including objections from Liberal Premiers, it strikes me as quite incongruous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead it is an admission by the Prime Minister that the Bills pose a serious threat to State <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secrecy provisions in the legislation infringe basic civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> and penal clauses for defence purposes are not appropriate for a civilian industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trouble is that the Premiers are afraid, not of the codes yet, because they have not been formulated, but of the legislation as it stands, for as they understand it they are afraid it will infringe their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was attacked specifically because it was said that the legislation would infringe State <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, again arguing for the sake of this discussion as a liberal liberal, valiantly standing for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States, I say that surely given the sort of communication that has been received from a number of Premiers, including the Premier of Victoria, the Government would be far better advised to delay the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as that process is unacceptable to the Liberal Premier of Victoria and to almost every other State Premier, it ought to be thoroughly unacceptable to all those members of this Parliament, particularly the so-called small ‘1’ liberals, who continually harp about State <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but when it comes to a situation of allowing this Minister and this Government to override those <span class="highlight">rights</span> in a very real way they are not prepared to speak on behalf of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us make it very clear that not only State <span class="highlight">rights</span> are at issue in these two clauses; the matter of civil liberties is very much involved also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we look at what happened last evening to the Atomic Energy Commission Bill we see that no State <span class="highlight">rights</span> are left under that legislation- the Commonwealth has the power to go in and mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we talk about these matters let us make it clear that if we have a national or international responsibility, we also have a responsibility in the area of civil <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition accepts that but there is also a responsibility in the area of civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> and other matters which are affected by this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is, of course, the sort of inevitable process which will develop under a government such as this Government and under a Prime Minister who is so arrogant that he is not really concerned about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Parliament, just as he is not concerned about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They could go off to a State court, but if they have to find a federal court to deal with the matter- it could be only the High Court- it would be a most expensive one and one which is likely to prevent them from exercising any of their normal judicial <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the wording of the clause that is offensive because the test is so subjective that it could affect people ‘s <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I make it very clear that legislation is not drafted in this way by those who are interested in the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it is of paramount importance among these new <span class="highlight">rights</span>, since clearly the enjoyment of traditional as well as new social <span class="highlight">rights</span>  pre-supposes  mechanisms for their effective protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Effective access to justice can thus be seen as the most basic requirement, the most basic human right, of a system which purports to guarantee legal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Has his attention been drawn to the report in the  Canberra Times  of 8 March 1978 by Frank Cranston where he stated that a proper sharing of the Torres Strait waters between Australia and Papua New Guinea leave within the Port Moresby administration the Queensland islands which lie to the south of the Papua New Guinea coast, that a regime is being sought with Papua New Guinea which will ensure protection for the traditional fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people on the disputed islands without circumscribing the generality of Port Moresby’s prerogatives down to an agreed median line and that although the Governments have agreed in principle over the issue, the drafting of the legislation giving force to it is expected to prove difficult; if so, is there any substance in the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-45-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore correct that the Austraiian Government has sought a regime which will ensure protection for the traditional fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the local inhabitants of the Torres Strait, and has obtained the provisional agreement of the Government of Papua New Guinea to the establishment of a Protected Zone for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-45-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we have sought is to achieve self-management for those communities and also, when the reserve lands which had been set aside for those communities were abolished, security of that land for their traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span> and their <span class="highlight">rights</span> of use and occupation which they had enjoyed for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Also it has a responsibility under the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span> to provide such remedies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When it was put by one of your own Ministers at the Premiers’ Conference that we should legislate in this field to protect human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, Bjelke-Petersen said ‘I won’t have a bar of it.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>People are gaoled throughout the length and breadth of Queensland for seeking to exercise the <span class="highlight">rights</span> you loudly proclaim in the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we speak of the need for the protection of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Australia, we are speaking about enshrining minimum <span class="highlight">rights</span>- minimum democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span>, minimum legal process <span class="highlight">rights</span>, minimum prohibition of anti-discrimination, minimum <span class="highlight">rights</span> of freedom of speech, thought and religion and freedom of assembly and association, and you have not got it in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliaments may add to and expand these <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but they should not subtract from them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said in his statement that ‘the Government is concerned about infringements of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> wherever they occur’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said, in relation to human <span class="highlight">rights</span> under State laws: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the Prime Minister was saying that States <span class="highlight">rights</span> are more important than human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of great regret that human <span class="highlight">rights</span> have increasingly been suppressed around the world and particularly in our own neighbourhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The plain established fact is that Indonesia has engaged in a gross and consistent violations of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Timor which ought not to have been condoned as they have been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the Fraser Government is out of step with the United States on human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, Indian Ocean arms control, and nuclear nonproliferation policy, to name only three areas where it claims close identity with American policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to acknowledge cultural differences with our neighbours, but if we do not maintain a consistent concern for human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in our policies we risk more blatant disregard for human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in neighbouring countries and, we risk, also, a progressive deterioration of and disregard for human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms in our own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That of course would raise very serious questions of privacy and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the question of the violation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> of parliamentarians in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A former Argentinian member of Parliament,  Senator Yrigoyen,  was present at the conference as a direct result of the representations that had been made by the IPU on the violation of his human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and his imprisonment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a number of other cases from a variety of countries and we, as Australian parliamentarians, should take note of the reports of that committee of the IPU and use our Parliament and our own Foreign Affairs Department to take action to assist in the correction of these violations of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing I noticed was the rather curious way in which countries with totalitarian regimes and with poor domestic records of respect for basic individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms always seemed to be most concerned about the preservation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basically, I stated that resolutions from international organisations regarding Israeli practices should be approached as Middle East rather than human <span class="highlight">rights</span> issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My other approach to this subject was to criticise those who, at conferences such as this one, use double standards in treating this issue solely as a human <span class="highlight">rights</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I made the point that countries like the Soviet Union should put thenown house in order before voting against Israel on human <span class="highlight">rights</span> issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can have no credibility while they and other such regimes continue to violate basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in their own countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of these countries can boast of supporting democratic freedoms or even the most basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the PLO of course, the champions of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> at the IPU conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The PLO delegates also were supporters of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> at this conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every communist country, almost every Third World country, all Arab countries voted unanimously against Israel ostensibly on human <span class="highlight">rights</span> grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just hope that this kind of behaviour which contradicts and prevents the free flow of ideas, policies and philosophies at such conferences is not universal because I fear that if it is, these international meeting places may do more harm than good for the cause of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I particularly deplore the honourable member for Perth re-opening the debate on a particular issue and talking about double standards because when I attempted to have placed on the agenda the question of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Timor I was not backed up by the Government supporters of the delegation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Perth did not support me on a human <span class="highlight">rights</span> issue that lies on our doorstep, but he is very concerned about human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Russia, Israel and other parts of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He indicated that it was a firm commitment of the Government to preserve the independent <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people of Aurukun and Mornington Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had denied all the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts are that where human <span class="highlight">rights</span> are concerned, where fundamental respect of the civil liberties of people is at issue and where proper standards normally accepted by the community in these matters are concerned the Queensland Government cannot be trusted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear from the contents of that Bill- the power which it proposes to put in the hands of the Queensland Government- that the Queensland Government neither repents nor retreats from its position of dogged opposition to the proposition that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people of those two communities, in common with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginal people generally in that State, should be respected and should be enshrined firmly in legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has often said that the Government is firmly committed to defending the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of these Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said in the firmest terms imaginable that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people would be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the legislation for self-management, through local government, is not satisfactory, if it doesn’t measure up, if the terms of the special lease to secure these <span class="highlight">rights</span> of use and occupation to the Aboriginal people living there do not measure up, then the Commonwealth is prepared to acquire, to see that the people obtain what they ought to obtain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that there can be no parleying with a government as regressive, reactionary and insensitive to fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> as the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He encouraged those people to believe that the Government would expeditiously take firm steps to protect their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland also reserves to itself power over mineral search and <span class="highlight">rights</span> in these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some who see the objective as not one of self-management, of the ability of people to make decisions for their own benefit and welfare, but rather of land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I would be quite prepared to admit- and our policy sets it out as a long-term objective- that land <span class="highlight">rights</span> should be provided to Aboriginal people throughout Australia, it must be looked at in the context of what is achievable here and now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the right, in the form of an option, to acquire property or the right for a repayment of a loan or <span class="highlight">rights</span> attendant on shares which the deceased had at the time of his death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they are not satisfied even the advertisers suffer and they may claim that they have certain <span class="highlight">rights</span> because they are trying to sell goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that a ‘single buying agency’ should be set up, as was recommended in the 1973 report of the Tariff Board concerning motion picture films and television programs, with the exclusive authority to buy exhibition <span class="highlight">rights</span> for British and foreign films, series and specials for Australian television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the programs had been bought overseas the ‘single buying agency’ would then conduct a domestic auction in Australia and the highest bidder would acquire the Australian domestic <span class="highlight">rights</span> from the agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Northern Territory administration was concerned about the role it would play in a national park and the Northern Land Council was very concerned that any role the Northern Territory administration played might impinge upon the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It knows that since the early 1950s Australia had not served on the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All members of this Parliament will be fully aware of my longstanding concern for the welfare of the people of East Timor, not merely because of Australia’s debt of gratitude to them for their stalwart and loyal support in the dark days of World War II, but because I believe, and all Australians believe, in the sanctity of basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, including self-determination and, of course, all of us would be concerned about the threat to Australia’s integrity and national security posed by the continuation of major military action involving all forms of conventional warfare in an area that is less than half an hour flying time from Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have looked for a treaty settlement which will have the capacity to adapt to changing circumstances on matters of day-to-day significance while at the same time retaining a durable certainty about the distribution and nature of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the parties concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Thus, whilst there has been preoccupation with the Torres Strait as an area of special significance to both countries, the question of the delimitation of seabed and fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span> throughout the whole area running some 1,200 miles from the Arafura Sea to the Coral Sea has also been of major importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not want to see any weak-kneed approach to the position as to what are alleged to be Queensland’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> because we are concerned about what has happened already in Queensland in two areas- Aborigines and human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At Federation, the citizens of the Northern Territory, as residents of the State of South Australia, enjoyed the same political <span class="highlight">rights</span> as other Commonwealth citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the requirements of the Constitution, those political <span class="highlight">rights</span> were removed in 1910 when the Territory was transferred from South Australia and accorded the status of a Commonwealth Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a very real sense, the constitutional history of the Northern Territory since that date reflects the endeavours of the people of the Territory to regain the <span class="highlight">rights</span> which they lost in 1910. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that principle were adopted I do not think it would involve any serious diminution of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Minister but it would put the Minister at the same level as all other parties to the proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister would be well advised to examine that proposal because I can see difficulties arising if the Commonwealth chooses to place itself in a position where the Minister does not approach the Court with the same <span class="highlight">rights</span>, no more and no less, as the other parties before the court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in fact we have jurisdiction over the whole of the zone for 200 miles, and if the purpose of the Act is to give certain fishing licences or certain <span class="highlight">rights</span>, we would surely still have jurisdiction over the residue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The urgency of the task is demonstrated by many reported submissions from countries or organisations wishing to have fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span> or joint ventures established in our area of responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This means that Australia will inevitably have to grant fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span> to other nations, working under Australian control and conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that that places those countries in an advantageous position when negotiating with us over fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In regard to this issue we can well understand the Minister’s concern to guarantee that those citizens are able to maintain the <span class="highlight">rights</span> which by custom and usage they have had for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been suggested- I think it is probably not disputed- that the Torres Strait Islanders as a matter of custom, usage and existing <span class="highlight">rights</span> have access to those islands for their resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of necessity, it had to assess the limits of its territory and territorial jurisdiction, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of freedom of movement of its people, their freedom of access for the purposes of trade and commerce, its requirements for defence, both national and international, and its freedom of access to the seas adjacent to its mainland for the purpose of exploiting the natural resources on or beneath the seabed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So far the product of the 1976 Convention has been referenda on four items- simultaneous elections of the Houses of this Parliament, voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the Territories, retiring ages forjudges, and the procedure for making appointments to casual vacancies which arise in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It certainly does not guarantee the fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the citizens of this community, and where it does guarantee <span class="highlight">rights</span> it tends to guarantee them as a conservative instrument would- that is, it fails to protect broadly <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the community, but rather entrenches privileged position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is well understood, however, that this will be an evolutionary process; the second amendment explicitly requires that special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> may only be allocated if there is a global need to supplement the existing stock of reserve assets, and in such a manner as will avoid exacerbating excess demand and world inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I commend this Bill to the House and draw the attention of honourable members to the desirability of early approval of the Bill in order to enable the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  to exercise the proposed increased voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Australia at the next regular elections of executive directors of the Fund and the Bank in September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In referring to our own Government, it would be essential that the closest consultation with the States takes place, bearing in mind the dual jurisdiction that applies between the States and the Commonwealth under the constitutional <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under that requirement, of course, Australia is at liberty to negotiate for some advantageous position by way of trading fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span> within the 200-mile zone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But trading presupposes that a country has something to sell, and because we have demonstrated historically our lack of capacity to develop those resources, I am not convinced that we can persuade foreign nations to advance a consideration to us for fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span> within the area described when they know full well that, if we persist with our present inefficient and ineffective measures, in some brief time international opinion will direct Australia to make available to foreign nations those waters within the 200-mile zone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is trying to provide the Public Service with the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges and restrictions and controls as those applying under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to the private enterprise sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have shown quite clearly that the Government is trying to bring the Public Service into line with the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, privileges, controls, restrictions and the general ordinances of other organisations that come under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I was saying, clearly in the private sector the trade union movement quite rightly accepts the restrictions, <span class="highlight">rights</span>, controls and privileges provided under those awards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why should the Public Service not be given the same priviliges and <span class="highlight">rights</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why should it be a privileged body that is allowed to have different <span class="highlight">rights</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Hindmarsh made it quite clear that the Labor government was opposed to privileges, <span class="highlight">rights</span> and everything given to public servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real fact is that public servants get many privileges under this Government, and they are protected in many ways, but they know in their hearts and in their minds that they should not get more <span class="highlight">rights</span> than their fellow Australians; therefore, they should be bound by the same rules of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission as the ordinary workers of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They follow the Commonwealth Employees (Provisions) Act and the amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, both of which cut down on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of public servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is consistent, as I said, with the Government’s determination to undermine the basic civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> and individual liberties of workers generally and public servants in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second part, consular protection, arises from international practice of sovereign states recognising an obligation to protect the civil and legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> of their citizen when abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the report of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner I am presenting is the first report submitted by the Commissioner since the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act has been in force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members will recall that the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act, which was passed late in 1976 and proclaimed on Australia Day 1 977, provided for the appointment of an Aboriginal Land Commissioner whose functions include the preparation of reports on applications made to him on behalf of Aboriginals claiming to have a traditional land claim to an area of land being either unalienated crown land or alienated crown land in which all estates and interests not held by the crown are held by or on behalf of Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have accepted the Commissioner’s recommendations and will, accordingly, establish these land trusts and will recommend to the Governor-General that a grant of an estate in fee simple for that land be made under the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act to the land trusts as set out above. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking into account the fact that the Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act had provided for the low water mark as the boundary for land in Schedule I of the Act, the Commissioner has similarly fixed low water mark in his recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 87 people listed as traditional Aboriginal owners of the town common at Borroloola and the islands to which the report refers include traditional owners of Bing Bong station lands, and the traditional land <span class="highlight">rights</span> as distinct from ownership usufruct of the land for various purposes, extend to a much larger group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that he will take up the points I have mentioned, but I think he will concede that in statements he made before he became Minister he spoke frequently of mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the area of the protection of civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> against a large and, as some would see it, an increasingly powerful bureaucracy this Government has done more than any in the history of Australia to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of average Australian men and women against bureaucratic decisions of one kind or another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-3-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat what I said to the Minister: This Bill is now a complete farce because there is no way in the world the Government can now impose a nuclear code which has any guts in it, any toughness, any restrictions on the States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have a little more feeling about their sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> than does this Minister and this sloppy slap-dash Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government was so anxious that in the first place, it produced a Bill which ran absolutely roughshod over State’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not only a question of federalism; it is a question of protecting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the citizens of this country irrespective of whether they live in a Territory or a State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conference recognises that the provision of Australian uranium to the world nuclear fuel cycle creates problems relevant to Australian sovereignty, the environment, the economic welfare of our people, and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and well-being of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I do not think the Committee needs to be reminded that we are talking about the constitutional obligations and the constitutional <span class="highlight">rights</span> that the Commonwealth has in regard to nuclear codes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that if the Government were honest in its proclaimed view- that is, of supporting States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span>- it would postpone this legislation while it had the discussions that have been sought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is no way in which to behave in a parliament of free people where minorities have <span class="highlight">rights</span> like anybody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must also emphasise that in drafting this legislation the Government has been very sensitive to the need to avoid undue interference with the exercise of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for mining companies in the Alligator Rivers region to retain their current <span class="highlight">rights</span> as far as ownership of and access to existing improvements constructed by them when the land on which the facilities have been erected becomes Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would stress that the Bill merely confirms the present position of the companies but settles any doubts about their legal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the intention of the original Act to protect the existing <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people who had a prior interest in Aboriginal land, as recommended by  Mr Justice  Woodward in his Royal Commission report on Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government accepts the need to avoid any argument over this issue, and is particularly mindful of the commitment of the then Labor Government, to guarantee ownership <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Ranger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore proposed that the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act should be amended to ensure that the companies are given <span class="highlight">rights</span> of access to and ownership of facilities erected to date by them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it amends the International Monetary Agreements Act to accord with recent amendments to the International Monetary Fund’s articles of agreement and those amendments involve in turn 3 items: Firstly, a run-down in the role of gold as a reserve asset in the international monetary system and a concomitant, greater reliance on special drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span>; secondly, it recognises the abandonment of the so-called <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each increase has the effect of increasing our drawing <span class="highlight">rights</span> on the Fund should we have need of it at some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noted with some interest the final paragraph of the second reading speech by the Minister for Special Trade Representations  (Mr Garland),  on behalf of the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  in which he commended the Bill to the House and drew our attention to the desirability of early approval of the Bill in order to enable the Treasurer to exercise the proposed increased voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> for AustraUa at the next regular election of executive directors of the Fund and the Bank in September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second and perhaps the more important for a country such as Australia is that it determines the number of voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> that we have in the Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would not take him very long and he has travel <span class="highlight">rights</span> as a member of parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of that lack of understanding the Government has been led into this misguided assault on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the trade union movement to manage its own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me, as a trade unionist with some 23 years experience, stress that any dedicated unionist would see the purpose of trade union training as a means of improving his or her ability to fight for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people whom he or she represents, not as a means of creating a better or a smoother industrial relations situation for the benefit of the employers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I call on the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  to investigate this situation in which the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and dignity, not to mention the cash, of citizens are being abused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we getting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> result? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the United Kingdom, which economically is a poorer society than ours, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the disabled are enshrined in the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of these people to fulfilling lives cannot be denied, and their contribution to our national life should not be thrown away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of Soviet Russia’s minimal human <span class="highlight">rights</span> obligations under the 1975 Helsinki Accord, what assessment has Australia made of the genuineness and sincerity or otherwise of Soviet Russia following the fake trial and savage sentence of imprisonment imposed on  Dr Yuri  Orlov? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I think all members of this House have been concerned about breaches of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> as they have occurred around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have certainly emotionally supported the general concern expressed by the  President  of the United States of America about the extent to which human <span class="highlight">rights</span> are prejudiced in many countries- tragically, far too many. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is certainly, within the fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> that lie in the precepts of the Helsinki agreement, an understanding which it was hoped might be seen as an advance in the general form of protection of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> within the Iron Curtain countries and would lead to an advancement, a recognition, of the United Nations Covenant on Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in general all I can say is that  Dr Orlov  ‘s trial and sentence certainly will serve to qualify Western confidence that the Soviet Union intends to honour its commitments on the implementation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One sympathises, of course, with his views on civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Soviet Union and such places but Indonesia, which is much closer to home - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As I have suggested there are, tragically, many countries where the standard of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> on which we insist in this country are not observed and, tragically, some of those countries are in our own region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot, nor should we, impose our system on other countries but I must, as an individual and as a member of the Government, say that we would hope that the statements that have been made by, in particular, the  President  of the United States of America with respect to human <span class="highlight">rights</span> might be observed by those countries which at this stage do not observe our system relating to the rule of law and the protection of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until we do that, we feel that it is improper and discourteous for us not to talk with the States, because it does have very severe implications as regards some of the authority and some of the sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commutation will not, however, affect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the member’s widow or widower to an annuity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to canvass the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or wrongs of payroll tax,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  but I just say to you that they are the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall now move to deal with specific purpose grants which, it is claimed, distort State priorities and infringe State <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Wran’s  hypocrisy must be exposed and must be nailed to the wall here and now, because this great champion of lower taxation, this man who says he wants to reduce the burden on the people of New South Wales, has to my certain knowledge never made a public statement conceding that under Stage II of the federalism policy he can in fact exercise his <span class="highlight">rights</span> to grant a rebate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#debate-65">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way in which an authority such as the one suggested by the honourable member could be set up would be for the States to relinquish some of their constitutional <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Opposition has not opposed the discussion of these Bills together we are rather concerned at the precipitate way in which some Bills have been brought in this week to be debated this week; in particular, the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Amendment Bills (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not alone, and the Opposition is not alone, in this concern because this year one of the outstanding developments in the field of Aboriginal affairs, the one that has perhaps drawn more public notice and comment than any other issue in Aboriginal affairs, was the one-eyed approach of the State Government in Queensland- I stress that it is of the same political colour as the Administration in the Northern Territory- over the matter of land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that there is strong feeling among whites in the Northern Territory that they have <span class="highlight">rights</span> also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a transcript from  This Day Tonight  of 31 May tided White Backlash from Katherine NT on Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Committee stage of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill we will also spell out some of our misgivings with regard to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The misconceptions relate to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines overriding those of whites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has never been, and I cannot see that there ever will be, from the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council, the bodies responsible for negotiating land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the Northern Territory, a claim for anything like 50 per cent of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For our <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were asked: ‘ What <span class="highlight">rights</span>? ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were asked what <span class="highlight">rights</span> were being denied them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe there has not been adequate consultation with the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly on this legislation as to what will happen to funding and what its <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we are also giving him some prerogative <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Capricornia made some remarks about those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed that <span class="highlight">rights</span> similar to those which apply under the Commonwealth legislation at the present time will be available under Northern Territory legislation upon that enactment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely they ought to be permitted to express their views as to the effects of the legislation on their income and their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is very outrageous legislation, from the point of view that the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory has <span class="highlight">rights</span> of its own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear from High Court decisions that we can pass legislation which says that the people in the Territory will not have any <span class="highlight">rights</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no guaranteed <span class="highlight">rights</span> in respect of having a vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say something later about the Constitution which does not give any <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is no way in which to draft legislation to give to the people of the Northern Territory their own parliament, their own members of parliament and their own <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> can be completely removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not appoint somebody to exercise all those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think he probably overlooked the fact that somewhere between one-fifth and one-sixth of the Territory is Aboriginal land anyhow under the reserves which were transferred to the Aborigines as Aboriginal land under the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I come now to the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under clause 4 of this Bill there is an amendment which states that the Commonwealth can take over and extend its influence on this land and that virtually it can overrule the control or ownership of that land in the Northern Territory by way of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act it will pass under the trust and then the Northern Territory Administration could well have to pay rent to the trust, the then owners of the land- the tribal people- for land which has been taken away but not compensated for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that under section 7a of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Amendment Act there could be some mention of the Majority Leader in this regard, because the administration of land will change and therefore it would be appropriate for the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory to replace the Minister for the Northern Territory on that list for consultation or, if not to replace him, to be added to the list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, as a former Minister for Housing, Minister for Construction and Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, I naturally maintain a keen interest in the development of the Territory and in the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people who live there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition has circulated amendments to this Bill and to the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>freed and discharged from any restriction, dedication or reservation made by or under any enactment, to the intent that the legal estate in the land or interest, and all <span class="highlight">rights</span> and powers incident to that estate or conferred by the  Lands Acquisition Act  1 955 in relation to that estate, are vested in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, of course, does not take away from this Federal Parliament its <span class="highlight">rights</span> to legislate in a way that would over-ride legislation of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly to which it may object. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is really to safeguard the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Assembly so that it has a channel of appeal to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other important issues which arise in that area include the great question of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, what to do with our uranium, the bluetongue problem and the illegal importation of drugs, plants and animals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the question of potential mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a law conferring the power to make determinations by way of the ascertainment of <span class="highlight">rights</span> or obligations conferred or imposed on persons by law; or <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>freed and discharged from any restriction, dedication or reservation made by or under any enactment (not being an interest to which sub-section (6) applies), to the intent that the legal estate in the interest, and all <span class="highlight">rights</span> and powers incident to that estate or conferred by the  Lands Acquisition Act  1955 in relation to that estate, are vested in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>External affairs, defence in some aspects at least, and customs tariffs are obvious cases, but others might need to be added, such as coinage and legal tender as well as, of course, the major matters of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, uranium and related matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Might I take the opportunity also to counsel people who are commenting on Aboriginal affairs policy in Australia and claiming that in the area of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> there is a suggestion of separatism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say also that if anyone suggests that the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> policy, particularly the kind of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> which this Government has introduced in the Northern Territory, is a policy of separatism he might just as well say that the policies of all governments, both State and Commonwealth, for the past 60-odd years which set aside special areas as reserves are policies of separatism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that when the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> policy of the present Government, as shown through the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation, is properly understood it will be seen that it not only acknowledges the Aborigines traditional relationship with land but also can provide the Aborigines, on a basis of equality, with a firm economic foundation for their future development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme is to cover exports of manufactured goods, some bulk farm and agricultural products, services provided overseas, value added industrial services provided in Australia performed on overseas owned items subsequently re-exported, and the sale of industrial property <span class="highlight">rights</span> and know-how that are substantially of Australian origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major parts of the Bill concern, firstly, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of officers of the Australian Public Service who move to other areas of Commonwealth employment and, secondly, the disciplinary provisions applicable to Public Service Act staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to those parts of the Bill- primarily clause 3 1 -which relate to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of officers of the Australian Public Service who move to other areas of Commonwealth employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s intention is that the provisions in this Bill should assist officers to gain appropriate experience outside the Public Service properthat is to say, the central Public Service- without loss of their Public Service <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This entitlement, however, will not be at the expense of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of officers who remain in the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This part of the Bill is based on the report of a sub-committee of the Joint Council set up to review the Officers’ <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Declaration Act, an Act which currently specifies the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of staff who move from the Public Service to some other area of Commonwealth employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides for leave without pay from the Public Service, with the preservation of all of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> normally applied to staff on leave without pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides that these officers sever their direct connection with the Public Service but retain certain specified <span class="highlight">rights</span> such as the right to apply for transfer and promotion to Public Service positions in accordance with the normal merit procedures set out in the Public Service Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Joint Council recommended that, where officers are transferred out of the Public Service to an independently staffed authority as a result of the transfer of functions to that authority, the second tier should apply to cover the Public Service <span class="highlight">rights</span> of transferred officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s policy is that, from the commencing day of the new scheme, the present Officers’ <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Declaration Act will no longer be available in relation to officers of the Public Service who take up employment with Commonwealth authorities after that date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Greater emphasis is placed on specification of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of persons against whom disciplinary action is taken, including such matters as <span class="highlight">rights</span> of reply to charges, entitlements to reasons for decisions, extension of appeal <span class="highlight">rights</span> to cover all formal disciplinary action, and provisions enabling findings to be reviewed when new evidence comes to light. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will, however, be appeal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be noted that these amendments are, in intent and import, identical with those which we moved to the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to enlarge on the remarks I made at the time of the first amending Bill this year, other than to say that it is consistent with Labor Party policy from before 1975 when we introduced land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation and it is consistent with the stand that we took in 1 976 when the principal Act was carried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will concede that there are <span class="highlight">rights</span> for mining and minerals and that Australia has an urgent need for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can accept those particular sentiments as legitimate, but we just wonder whether they reflect the priorities of the Government in Aboriginal affairs and whether mineral development and State <span class="highlight">rights</span> are being allowed to ease out Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was showing again his concern for State <span class="highlight">rights</span> with regard to minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have felt uneasy, as I believe people at Aurukun and other places have felt uneasy, that this concern in some way may have weakened his resolve in approaching States on matters of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> and his part in framing legislation for land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are concerned to have his assurance that the Opposition ‘s amendments, which we bring forward for the second time this year, will receive due consideration and that the sentiments reflected therein will be given due weight when Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> vis-a-vis mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span> are considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Capricornia  (Dr Everingham)  has already said, the amendments are the same as those put forward by him on 3 and 10 May during the debate on another Bill earlier this year, that is, the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, may I add that when agreement is eventually reached under the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation in the Northern Territory for the mining or uranium in the Alligator Rivers Region, we will see the full flowering of the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> granted to the Aboriginals in the Northern Territory as a consequence of the deliberate action by the Liberal-National Country Party Government to put Aboriginals in a position that they have never occupied before in the history of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, we will see the full flowering of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation when that agreement is finally entered into by the Northern Land Council with respect to mining at Ranger and subsequently with those other companies that wish to exploit the uranium deposits of Aboriginal traditional land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clear and unequivocal assurances were given by the Prime Minister and the Minister that the Aboriginal peoples at both Aurukun and Mornington Islands would be given <span class="highlight">rights</span> to determine their own future and that those <span class="highlight">rights</span> would be made secure by the land passing to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> goes to the very heart of the Aboriginal situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ever since, we have had to drag land <span class="highlight">rights</span> into this House and the other place against the wishes of honourable members opposite to keep the issue alive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we take the analogy of Aurukun and transfer it to the Northern Territory situation what guarantee do we have that the Aboriginals will have permanent <span class="highlight">rights</span> and security of tenure of their land? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are not many people in Australia, even among honourable members opposite in the Liberal Party, who would place any faith in the Premier of Queensland when it came to the preservation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> or anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that it is pretty clear throughout the community and to Australians generally that unless we strengthen this land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation almost everything we do for the Aboriginal people will be brought into disarray. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member said that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly has an unhappy record, but it introduced legislation granting land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Aboriginals long before this Parliament ever did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I want to pay a tribute to my colleague the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  who, as a Minister in a former government, did more than any Minister in this place, before or since, to open up the whole question of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having examined the record of the honourable gentleman’s political colleagues,  Mr Justice  Woodward was quite emphatic in stating in his report that the future of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> certainly did not rest, in terms of political judgments or the so-called compassion of members of the National Country Party, in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having had a look at the record, all I want to say is that honourable gentlemen opposite have discovered land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it had not been for some of those members of the Labor Government speaking eloquently, passionately and almost with a minority voice in this Parliament, the granting of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> would be 50 years away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The record condemns honourable gentlemen  opposite  who in 1972 were prepared to let their Prime Minister tell them, as he did on Australia Day- a symbolic day- that, as far as he was concerned, there would be no granting of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>( 4 ) In exercising his <span class="highlight">rights</span> under sub-section ( 3 ), an Aboriginal is not entitled knowingly to disregard any reasonable requirements of the lessee of the pastoral lease in connexion with the bore waters on the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“(6) A person who, without just cause, proof of which lies upon the person, prevents or obstructs, or attempts to prevent or obstruct, an Aboriginal from exercising his <span class="highlight">rights</span> under this section is guilty of an offence against this section punishable, upon conviction, by a fine not exceeding $ 1 ,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition still feels the need, as it did at that time, to establish more definitely and more securely the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines to their traditional land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a reasonable concession to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no Godgiven infallibility to those people who put down roads or town plans that they have done it with full prior knowledge and consideration of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Atomic Energy Act and its application to this question of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Northern Territory has been debated earlier this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any legislation which confers <span class="highlight">rights</span> on the Government of the Northern Territory it ought to be noted that in his report at paragraph 740  Mr Justice  Woodward stated:  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He mentioned disquiet that ordinances of that legislature would erode the principles of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the present Act, there is no specific provision, as was recommended by  Mr Justice  Woodward, which would expand the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines to enter upon pastoral leases for traditional purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the time remaining to me in this debate, I should like to deal quickly with one of the major pressures which is being exercised in the community by the Australian mining industry which recently has attacked the operation of the Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe at this time, before this Parliament hands over responsibility to the Government of the Northern Territory, it ought to say clearly and unequivocally:  ‘We will strengthen this legislation in accordance with the Woodward report and in accordance with our review that it is time that the Aboriginal people who, for so long have been discriminated against in terms of their own tradition, their own <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and their own culture will have their place in the sun and that their <span class="highlight">rights</span> will not be diminished by mining companies which are prepared to use considerable funds to undermine their claims. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1978 in some respects is a machinery Bill but it has particular significance for the Opposition and for Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that the purpose of the Bill, as expressed by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  in his second reading speech, is to retain the current <span class="highlight">rights</span> of mining companies in the Alligator Rivers Region, in regard to access to inprovements that have been constructed, when the land becomes Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, as has been mentioned in the debate on the Bill which has just been passed, is not something that was dreamed up in recent years or after the days of the Labor Administration in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The merit of the claims received some publicity which started to bring home to people such as politicians and journalists what Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> were all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two years later, with a different parliament in Canberra, the Labor Government made the point that it would take action on Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, despite the opposition of the conservative parties which had been in power in 1972 and which opposed land <span class="highlight">rights</span> at that stage, as was mentioned in the debate on the previous Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government appointed  Mr Justice  Woodward to inquire into the manner in which land <span class="highlight">rights</span> could be put into effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 do not know when the new look in the Liberal and National Country Parties came about or where they spelt out their commitment to Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Other commitments were that Aborigines should also determine how their land <span class="highlight">rights</span> are to be used and that they should have the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> as any other land owner to determine who enters the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, when we are looking at the concept which Aborigines have of land rightsnamely, a communal, traditional and perpetual ownership of land by a group of people- I believe that there is a case for going beyond that provision which was adopted by the parties opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Aborigines ought to have more than just the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> as any other landowner to determine who enters their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the following year, 1 976, the principal Act which this Bill seeks to amend- the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act- was introduced by the administration of the parties which are now in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basically, we in the Opposition are still uneasy about the degree of commitment to Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> which is spelt out in every one of these Bills, as against a commitment to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of States and State-like authorities- including the administration which will be responsible for the Northern Territory when it gains selfgovernment on 1 July- and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of mining companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He saw fit to relate my remarks to his previous interest in mining in Australia and to find them somehow impertinent or irrelevant to his commitment to Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress again that I am not impugning his commitment to Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are concerned about is the erosion here and there of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginals to their traditional land in favour of commercial development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that it is genuine cause for concern that the Government is not really putting Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> first, before appeasing and conceding to what has been apprehended as being public opinion- in fact, it was a public outcry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mere fact that States are charged with the responsibility by and large to determine mineral development, the mere fact that they are reluctant to concede to other governments, whether they be neighbouring State governments or the Federal Government, any of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> which might bring them credit or profit- particularly mineral exploration, mineral leases, mineral royalties and the like- and the mere fact that this is a State function traditionally ought to make it clear to members of this House and to the public generally that State governments and State-like authorities are not the appropriate bodies to give priority to Aboriginal land claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government is more disposed and more likely to be able to look at matters in the broad and not to be so uptight, so worried or so concerned whether mining <span class="highlight">rights</span> are preserved or whether mineral development goes ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government has more resources and can look at Australia as a whole in a way which ought to preclude it from putting those <span class="highlight">rights</span> before Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many ways- perhaps small- in which these mining <span class="highlight">rights</span> are acceded to or conceded to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the key to this Bill is the fact, as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  stressed in his second reading speech, that the Bill merely confirms the present position of companies in the area and settles any doubt about their legal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Principally, this Bill concerns the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people, both black and white. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With due respect, it is this Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation which has brought about the fall of the curtain, which is unfortunate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to those honourable members who have made so much of the recommendations of  Mr Justice  Woodward, on whose report the whole land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation was based, that he was instructed, as the shadow Minister said, to determine how to allocate the land to Aborigines, not whether it should be allocated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was said that the then Opposition did not object to the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> that were brought in in 1972, but in fact I did object as a Territorian because I considered that as they were then phrased they were doing great damage to Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition comes in here preaching about removing the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people to be able to put up a little sign saying that they represent something. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most people in Australia ought to express their gratitude for what he did for the preservation of such matters as freedom of speech, the protection of family <span class="highlight">rights</span> and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a very reserved view of governments’ attitudes to freedom of <span class="highlight">rights</span> and so on wherever some citizen gets in the road and there is a handy piece of legislation which may well be misused to suppress him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that this piece of legislation does what it ought to do with the necessary precision and does not make a proper reference to other people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> as it ought to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, we can go one step further and ask what are the conditions which cause a nation to grant diplomatic recognition so that <span class="highlight">rights</span> such as these can be exerted in the host country, Australia, by representation here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it can be said in any way whatsoever that a nation such as Yugoslavia, or any other nation, has the right to representation here, a right to representation by virtue of Article 22 of the Vienna Convention, such <span class="highlight">rights</span> ought to be considered or ought to apply in respect of a nation such as Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the House that recognition and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> that accompany recognition are <span class="highlight">rights</span> of convenience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are nothing else; they are totally <span class="highlight">rights</span> of conveniency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having done that, the Opposition now is willing to accept the absence of <span class="highlight">rights</span> for others because it is so anxious to kow-tow in order to get diplomatic recognition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>The events prior to and during the Second World War had a substantial influence on the awareness of and the respect for human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and fundamental freedoms in the preparation of the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 26 signatories to the declaration of the United Nations made on 1 January 1942 expressed their commitment that complete victory over their enemies was essential to defend life, liberty, independence and religious freedom, and to preserve human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and justice in their own lands as well as in other lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to realization through national effort and international co-operation and in accordance with the organization and resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural <span class="highlight">rights</span> indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and fundamental freedoms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms set forth in this Declaration can be fully realized. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the exercise of his <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms may in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nothing in this Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms set forth herein. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human <span class="highlight">rights</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It then proceeds to state in clear and unequivocal terms the <span class="highlight">rights</span> which every member of the world society should enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Declaration is not an international bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decisions taken in 1947 and 1948 were not to spell out one international bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> but to have a number of instruments to define and state a bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> applicable to all nations, the first of which was the Universal Declaration of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other parts of the international bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> are the international covenant on economic, social and cultural <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the international covenant on civil and political <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the optional protocol to the international covenant on civil and political <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The covenants, which are binding on all governments which accept them, expand the principles stated in the Declaration in greater detail and provide mechanisms for implementation of the several principles in the Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not yet ratified the covenant on civil and political <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> is too important a matter to be dealt with in terms of rhetoric and gesture; too important to be subordinated to political manoeuvre or made a matter of public relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was pleased to hear the Minister refer in the course of that statement to the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is conscious that we have not yet ratified the covenant on civil and political <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a matter we hope to rectify- like most things, human <span class="highlight">rights</span> begin at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New legislation will shortly be introduced to give effect to the Government’s election commitment to establish a human <span class="highlight">rights</span> commission relating to Commonwealth laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly, those reasons are as follows: Firstly, the importance of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the interrelationship of people throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another example is in very close proximity, namely, the action of the New South Wales Government in continuing to close its eyes to the denial of basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Noel Latham of Broken Hill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A third reason is that the covenant is now becoming a litmus test for governmental sincerity over human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is becoming evident that any government which does not ratify the covenant will have its credibility challenged if it seeks to make comment on the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> issue in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly, we are now represented on the United Nations Commission on Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, Australia cannot have a member on the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Committee unless we have ratified the covenant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1948 much has been done to implement the terms of the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> covenant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the International Conference on Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> at Teheran in 1968 substantially advanced the cause of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was recognised at the twenty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations when it was resolved that the conference had made an important constructive contribution to the cause of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and that its results should be translated into effective action by all states, by the competent organs of the United Nations and by other relevant international agencies and instrumentalities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the past 30 years the United Nations General Assembly has considered and passed a number of resolutions on a wide range of subjects using the 1948 Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> as its basic reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government of the Republic of South Africa to cease forthwith its continued imposition of discriminatory and repressive measures which are contrary to the principles and purposes of the Charter and which are in violation of its obligation as a member of the United Nations and of the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding South Africa’s position, the influence of the original Charter of the United Nations and more particularly of the Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, the covenants and the proclamation have been significant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is evident that many states still choose to ignore the terms of these human <span class="highlight">rights</span> documents and to deprive their citizens of one or more of the basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms to which all people are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Parliament has been engaged in the defence of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the propagation of the belief in freedom and in <span class="highlight">rights</span> for all people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in October 1977 the sub-committee on human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Soviet Union of the Parliament’s Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence widened its initial terms of reference to include the following:  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sub-committee on human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Soviet Union will shortly prepare a report on the subject of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the USSR. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will recall that  Dr Pluysh  was a leading mathematician who was arrested for his human <span class="highlight">rights</span> activities and for his efforts imprisoned for approximately four years in a psychiatric institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By letter dated 9 January 1978, and entitled ‘Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> of Parliamentarians’, the  President  of the Kenyan Group informed the Secretary General that discussions had been started between the Group and the authorities, and that he would keep him informed in due time of the progress made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Referring to the provisions of Chapter V of the Constitution of Kenya relating to the fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms of citizens and particularly Article 83 thereof which sets limits to derogations which may be brought into operation under the Preservation of Public Security Act; Section 3 of the Kenya National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act; the provisions of Articles 2(1) and 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (ratified by Kenya on 1 May 1972), and the provisions of Articles 9, 11(1) and 1 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We in Australia can play a much greater role than we have in the past in ensuring that more nations subscribe to and practice human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until we take a much more active role as a nation and as individuals, through organisations like Amnesty International, we cannot really claim standing in the world as a country fully committed to the Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> and its covenants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia is in no position to take a self-righteous posture on the subject of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the terrible things about these matters affecting human <span class="highlight">rights</span> is that they remind us that the State can be and often is a destructive force fuelled by a passion for orthodoxy and uniformity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Underlying the proposed changes is a belief that if investors could deduct their capital investment in Australian film <span class="highlight">rights</span> over two years instead of, as at present, over a much longer period of up to 25 years, there would be greater investment by Australians in the production of Australian films. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The concession for capital investment in Australian film <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be implemented by amendments to the provisions of the income tax law that have, since 1956, allowed otherwise non-deductible capital costs of acquiring industrial property <span class="highlight">rights</span> used in the production of assessable income to be written off over specified periods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments now proposed will- in relation to <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Australian films first used for income producing purposes after 21 November 1977- substitute two years for 25 years as the basic write-off period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They can destroy all that the Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act gave or pretended to give to the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the House of the letter sent today to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs by  Dr H.  C. Coombs, one of the most experienced and compassionate supporters of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition rejects the argument that it is no good to do something right because people will want more than their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should do the right thing first and then argue if they want more than their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition calls upon the Government to heed the sort of sentiments that are echoing through this country, not only from  Dr Coombs  but also from practically every Aboriginal organisation that has ever expressed its voice on land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say that the Government has acted in a way in which the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill was originally drafted and proposed to allow the Aborigines to negotiate on the terms and conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members look at the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act, they will see that it does not give the Aboriginals the right to stop mining or to withhold consent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Indians and for developing countries in negotiating mining <span class="highlight">rights</span> and leases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It even envisaged using the national interest provisions of the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation to make sure that they were honoured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other significant aspect with which I want to deal is the question of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government through legal tricks amended the Labor Party’s draft land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation to override the Aboriginal right to veto mining on Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actions arising from the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation have brought about the situation today- the pressure on land council members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I commend the non-smokers <span class="highlight">rights</span> movement for trying to mobilise that 70 per cent of Australia’s population which does not smoke but which suffers because of the 30 per cent which does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Set up a Select Parliamentary Committee along the lines of the New Zealand Select Committee to conduct a public inquiry into the ways and means of supporting and strengthening family life and providing adequate protection for children from physical and sexual abuse before as well as after birth in accordance with the UNO Declaration of the <span class="highlight">Rights</span> of the Child as part of Australia’s support for the Year of the Child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Prime Minister aware of statements made in Darwin by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs concerning the future of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Prime Minister give the Northern Land Council and this House an assurance that the Government will not in any way, through legislation or otherwise, weaken the Northern Land Council or the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation should the present situation in the Northern Territory not produce a favourable result for the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Government has already demonstrated its commitment to the Northern Land Council under the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation in the Northern Territory and it has demonstrated that in veryfirm and cogent ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This stands as a proud record of this Government in bringing to fruition policies which I had thought had the support of all members of this Parliament, and I have no doubt that the Government’s policies in relation to land <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be maintained and continued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister believe that the change of leadership in South Africa will assist black South Africans in obtaining basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The ownership of inventions, trade marks and designs creates important monopoly <span class="highlight">rights</span> which are recognised by and large throughout the whole of the industrialised world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These two measures which we are discussing this afternoon are a further step to impress upon the community the benefits which can be obtained from exercising property <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reduction of the publication date by 12 months means generally that patent <span class="highlight">rights</span> which are not effective until publication become available to the inventor at that earlier point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The services affected, of course, are extensive and I can give some examples of the sorts of services which could and may well use the new trade mark <span class="highlight">rights</span> in respect of services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally under these amendments the marks which are registered as service marks will gain protection throughout Australia and Norfolk Island, although I understand that there are some cases where the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of protection and of obtaining relief will be limited to some geographical areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Government makes all these moves with regard to regressive taxation measures, it forfeits completely its <span class="highlight">rights</span> to impose such measures as a resources tax on exploitation of our non-renewable energy resources, a capital gains tax, or a wealth tax with an appropriate threshold level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also welcome the recognition in the Camp David agreements of the legitimate <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Palestinian people, including their right to participate in the determination of their own future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr Evatt  played a central role in the founding of the state of Israel- an event which illustrated dramatically the Labor Party’s long-held commitments to protection of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals and minorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-41-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second, and equally important, principle here is that the Palestinian people also have <span class="highlight">rights</span> which must be recognised and aspirations which must be respected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-41-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has become a wideranging debate which takes into account not only the handover of limited <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the imposition of hard State responsibilities on the people of the Northern Territory but also northern development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole basis of the Government’s legislation in regard to this decision and in regard to the decision of the Northern Land Council is so important that I refer honourable members to the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-44-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under section 23 of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act the traditional Aboriginal owners of the land will discuss all aspects of the uranium mining to be carried out in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-44-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Whitlam Government foreshadowed that the national interest provisions of its Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill would be invoked to see that these contracts were honoured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The land claim to which this report refers is the second to be heard by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner in accordance with the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act provides, amongst other things, that Aboriginals may make traditional land claims in respect of areas of unalienated Crown land in the Northern Territory and that the Aboriginal Land Commissioner shall consider the claims and report upon them to me and my colleague the Minister for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall establish these land trusts and will recommend to the Governor-General that a grant of an estate in fee simple for the land be made under the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Likewise, I am advised that the Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act requires me to accept wholly or wholly reject the Commissioner’s recommendations; I have no power to attach conditions to those recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before we allow to pass out of the control of this Parliament the determination of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of Aborigines, including the right of Aborigines to live their own lives, I think proper and carefully set out legislation which deals with the tribal Aborigines and their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to live in the manner in which they wish to live in the Northern Territory should be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is absolutely essential that we should assert the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines to be Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last week, the Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony)  has been saying that if certain mining contracts were not signed then the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines in the Northern Territory could be in jeopardy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to realise- and I have discussed this at great length with Galarrwuy Yunupingu, who agrees with me- that if the Aborigines were to get all the money in the world from royalties, or all the power in the world through the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation, it still would not do them the slightest good if the rapport between blacks and whites were destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear them talking about the traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines and of the pressures being placed on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government of 1972-75 was elected on a policy of recognising Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By 1975 land <span class="highlight">rights</span> had not been recognised by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was this Government in 1976 that recognised land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite acknowledgment by the bulk of people to whom I spoke while visiting South Africa that apartheid is doomed and full political <span class="highlight">rights</span> have to be given to non-whites, the Government itself steadfastly pursues its policy of apartheid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be hoped that it will be ended on the initiative of the present South African Government rather than by what might be a violent initiative of those currently denied full <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, the United States has traditionally insisted on the same veto <span class="highlight">rights</span> as the Minister now asserts Australia will have, but the United States found that these <span class="highlight">rights</span> were violated in 19 cases between 1971 and 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It just seemed to me that once a man established his eligibility by enlisting and serving in an overseas theatre his <span class="highlight">rights</span> should not be taken away from him because of something that may have eventuated thereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They go to the courts and pay their penalty, and we do not pursue them relentlessly and deprive them of getting a decent living and having benefits and <span class="highlight">rights</span> that other citizens should have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do they really believe that they can impose a set of circumstances that can take away <span class="highlight">rights</span> which people can really think of in contractual terms when they enlist? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If he had received a report on the trial, I asked him whether it indicated that the trial accorded with the Soviet Union’s claim to be taking human <span class="highlight">rights</span> more seriously in accordance with its minimal Helsinki Pact obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistent with the Government ‘s commitment to promote respect for human <span class="highlight">rights</span> as set out in international instruments such as the Final Act of the Helsinki Agreement and the UN Convenants on Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, the Minister has in the past expressed the Government’s concern to the Soviet authorities about questions of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and will continue to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Minister’s statement as well as the publicly expressed concern of the Australian people at the treatment of  Dr Orlov  will demonstrate to the Soviet authorities the strength of our commitment to basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if there are any people in this community who are prepared to stand up and be counted on the issue of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, they should now be prepared to stand up and be counted on the basic and fundamental question whether or not Moscow is entitled to hold the 1980 Olympic Games. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take considerable support from honourable members such as the honourable member for McMillan  (Mr Simon)  and others in this Parliament who for a long time have been concerned about the question of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am absolutely convinced that those who say it is something on which we cannot make a stand, that those who say that we should not bring politics into sport, and that those who can come up with 10 1 reasons why we should not put ourselves out, should think again because no less a person- I should say no less a hero- than  Dr A.  K. Sakharov, in his book  My Country and the World,  made a statement which I believe should be the clarion call to those in the free countries of the West who believe in individual human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw attention to the fact that this week the parliamentary committee inquiring into the question of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> behind the Iron Curtain will be taking evidence from a man who until six months ago was a prisoner behind the Iron Curtain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By imposing the sales tax of 15 per cent on overseas gold coins, did the Government anticipate or intend any interference with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australian citizens to use freely gold coins minted in Australia for any purpose seen fit by the owners of those coins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-41-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s statement does raise some serious and, we would say, possibly contentious questions which we can enumerate as follows: Firstly, public accountability of government in all of” its areas; secondly, freedom of information; thirdly, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of public servants; fourthly, Crown privilege; and fifthly, parliamentary privilege. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But it is to the even greater shame of the present Government which inherited a strong body of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> law prepared in the Whitlam Government years and which has whittled them away ever since. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All the time we must remember that the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act, under which the Northern Land Council,  Dr Stephen  Zorn and the  Chairman  of the Council, Galarrwuy Yunupingu, are forced to work, does not allow Aborigines to withhold consent for uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whether one takes a legal view or a practical view, whether one talks about <span class="highlight">rights</span> which have been accrued or about reasonable expectations, the fact of the matter is that I believe the legislation involves the application of retrospectivity and to that extent I find it offensive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I take the opportunity during the discussion of the estimates for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to raise the question of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have in Western Australia the possibility of there developing a Queenslandtype situation in relation to the legitimate claims of the Aboriginal people for land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Aboriginal people throughout Australia have made perfectly clear their demand for land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is particularly perplexing for us and something that we have to scrutinise all the more diligently, because we know at least that the Premier of Queensland is opposed- he is prepared to take his opposition to extraordinary extremes- to the granting of any sort of real, permanent land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the Aborigines of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>particularly aware of is that there is not some sort of shoddy deal perpetrated in Western Australia under which the legitimate claims and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people of Western Australia are simply shoved under the carpet as a result of some collaboration between the Federal and State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Premier of Western Australia will always say that a system of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> does exist in Western Australia but, of course, that is only a subterfuge for the real thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The November 1973 statement of the Liberal and National Country Parties’ Aboriginal Affairs Policy indicated that in recognising the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginals in the Northern Territory, we would ensure: that mineral prospecting and mineral development should only be allowed under strict Government control and in a manner which protects sacred sites and reflects the views and needs of the traditional Aboriginal owners; that royalties from mining be used for the benefit of the Aboriginal people and that a fair proportion thereof be paid in trust on behalf of the traditional Aboriginal owners of the land on which mining is conducted ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-33-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should also make it clear to the House that the issue involved here is not whether mining will proceed but, pursuant to the terms of the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation, that the terms and conditions of mining must be agreed between the Northern Land Council and the companies involved in the mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would also be true if he had said that some people, most of them on the Liberal side of politics, care more about promoting uranium mining or changing the Government in New South Wales, at which they are not particularly adept, or elsewhere, than they do about Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sometimes people on this side of the chamber are presented as being raving radicals who, when they argue for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the unemployed, for example, are somehow taking a position which cannot be defended on rational grounds, a position which is not supported by groups which have status and standing and which represent all the welfare interests in Australia, certainly in the voluntary sector and partially in the government sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>None of us ever thought it likely that any Government, of whatever political party, would take away <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges that had been promised by a previous Government in the days when the community realised that it did have responsibilities towards those whose disabilities were the direct result of war service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An offshoot of this was that, because of the right and privilege of full medical treatment for most disabilities, <span class="highlight">rights</span> were not always exercised, and when various disabilities made themselves obvious, we received treatment, but did not take any action to have them accepted as due to war service, because it seemed so unnecessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first criterion is that any scheme be simple and understandable, and the scheme which is coming in is certainly an improvement on the one it is replacing with regard to simplicity and being understood, but because of the confusion in the general public’s mind with all the changes it is most important that the Government has an educational advertising scheme so that people are aware of what the new scheme is, what they may have to do, what their <span class="highlight">rights</span> are and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In any reasonable assessment of what happened last Saturday, it was a blundering, unnecessary performance and a clear exercise of political discrimination by a Minister who pleads the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of democracy but practices the principles of partiality in support of those he wishes to advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The major parts of the Bill concern, firstly, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of officers of the Public Service who move to other areas of Commonwealth employment and, secondly, the disciplinary provisions applicable to staff of the Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the main provisions of the legislation refers to the present Officers’ <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Declaration Act 1928, which specifies the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of permanent staff of the Public Service who engage in employment with Commonwealth authorities staffed outside the Public Service Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1973, following a comprehensive review of the existing provisions, the Joint Council of the Australian Public Service recommended that the Officers’ <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Declaration Act be repealed and be replaced by a new scheme to be inserted in the Public Service Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme covers officers who have taken up a position with a Commonwealth authority for a period of up to three years and maintains their <span class="highlight">rights</span> in certain important ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill envisages that the existing Officers’ <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Declaration Act will continue to apply only to persons covered by that Act at the time the new scheme comes into operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Greater emphasis will be placed on the specification of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of persons against whom disciplinary action is taken, including such matters as <span class="highlight">rights</span> of reply to charges, entitlements to reasons for decisions, extension of appeal <span class="highlight">rights</span> to cover all formal disciplinary action and provisions enabling findings to be reviewed when new evidence comes to light. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister acknowledged that he was conscious of the need to find the right balance between excessive government involvement in business matters and the protection of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the consumers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was significant not only for the fact that it introduced amendments to strengthen the principal Act and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of consumers in so many other directions but also because of the comment that he made, which I read into  Hansard  again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actions of this Minister in refusing to intervene significantly, despite a range of requests, to defend the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people in this area is a national calamity and disgrace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is definitely not is that they are pressing Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> only and exclusively in support of their own campaign against the mining companies and the Government’s uranium export policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 again ask any honourable member in this House to test what we, as a government, did in August 1977 and have done since then pursuant to the provisions of the Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation against the second reading speech of the then Labor Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the view I hold because if ever these land councils are to perform the duty that is cast upon them by the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation they must eschew political activity so that when the time comes in the ebb and flow of politics they will be in a position to serve the Aboriginal people, whatever political party is in power in Canberra or in Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am quite sure that in that spirit and in the pursuit of the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation in the end a result will be reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As all these programs of the Department develop, measured merely in money or through the activities of the National Aboriginal Conference, the Council for Aboriginal Development or the Government’s land <span class="highlight">rights</span> policies and other policies that honourable members will see in time to come, this Government will be able to look back upon its period of administration of Aboriginal affairs and say that it has given Aborigines a new look at the future- something for which they have been waiting for years and years but which has never been provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clearly the Minister is wild because the Aboriginal people are standing up for their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and at this stage will not allow his Government to mine uranium on their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As regards human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the Government’s views are clearly on the public record both within Australia and internationally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-37-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-I preface my question to the Prime Minister by reminding him of the statement he made in this House on 21 Septemberthat the Government had demonstrated its commitment to the Northern Land Council under the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation and that the Government’s policies in relation to land <span class="highlight">rights</span> would be maintained and continued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that under the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act the Northern Land Council must be satisfied that traditional land owners understand the nature and purpose of the draft Ranger agreement and as a group consent to it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter concerns the responsibilities of the Northern Land Council under the Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not know whether the fares that exist now will be able to be used as tour basing fares, just when the likely date is to be of the announcement of fares between other points of Europe and other points of Asia; what exactly will happen to other legs in an all-inclusive tour; whether or not the airlines already operating the Australia-London route will be able to sell a cheaper range of fares to and from those points; and what stop-over <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be allowed to passengers on those particular tour basing fares. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view, it is not good enough to argue that agreements such as this are based on the practicalities of the real world, such as the safety of passengers in Damascus, the travel costs of failing to maintain landing <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Middle East, and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion, the question of principle should override these considerations, and Qantas and this Government should not adhere to such agreements, even if we have to forgo our travel <span class="highlight">rights</span> in these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can understand all these problems but it does seem to me that it is far more important for this Parliament to say clearly to the Minister for Transport so that he will say to Qantas that, given the nature of Australian society- it is a nation that has people drawn from many origins and religious beliefs, or none- as a nation state operating internationally there is no way we will accept a position where we will be told that any Australian citizen who seeks to fly out of Australia to anywhere in the world will have his <span class="highlight">rights</span> restricted by the views of another nation state in terms of its perceived view of a religious belief or of a political belief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was equating the six uranium Acts with changes in the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation to weaken the Land Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation requires consultation with the traditional land owners and other Aboriginal communities before any agreement can be signed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendment will not apply in respect of assessments yet to be raised in respect of earlier years and it will not apply to assessments already raised in respect of the 1977-78 and prior years where the taxpayers’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> are protected by way of objection or appeal to a court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some of the more recent ramblings of members of the League of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> have suggested that the new international economic order has resulted in Australia’s economic policy being distorted by, and in the sole interests of, the developing countries to the detriment of the Government’s internal economic policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have to compliment those committees for the work they are doing, but, as the honourable member for Grayndler said to me, I hope that in the process we will regard ourselves and the Ministers will regard themselves as the protectors of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this Parliament and the people of this country and not allow the bureaucracy to put into law what it wants because it might find it easier to administer the amendments it wants rather than the amendments that the representatives of the people want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781025_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been the usual thing in the past for the ABC to televise this event, but this year the country dweller was denied the privilege of seeing it because metropolitan-based commercial interests were able to obtain exclusive <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the event-. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to that point I refer to the Australian Broadcasting Commission annual report in which some comments are made on this matter of sporting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rising cost of <span class="highlight">rights</span> to provide coverage of major sporting events on television continues to concern the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason, the ABC’s ability to secure the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to televise major national and international sporting event, to an Australia-wide audience is at growing risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of this process is that the ABC is subject in, for instance, the case of the 1978 Wimbledon tennis championships to criticism for not televising events in some States and many country areas not covered by the commercial television networks when they purchase exclusive Australian <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tonight I mention two issues that relate to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Telecom subscribers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A second case concerns the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms of the individual- subscriber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Commission look at those by-laws because, if it were to enforce that by-law in relation to the individual citizen who has a telephone directory in his own home, how on earth could it insist on <span class="highlight">rights</span> of entry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it would infringe the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of an individual citizen to enter his home to inspect the cover of his telephone directory to see whether it is covered or has adhering to it particular promotional material with advertising on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means that thousands of Australian citizens are currently being denied their legal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is, citizens whose legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> and whose applications had been approved and had been dealt with were simply awaiting an allocation of funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People on criminal charges because of a lack of means are not being represented at all and that, I believe, represents a fairly serious restriction in terms of civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> and civil liberties being dealt with in accordance with the due process of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have thought that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people to legal aid under the Family Law Act are a major factor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem also that the basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> of equality before the law and equal access to the courts cannot be attained without an adequate system of legal aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decisions which have now been made by the Government in this area, following decisions made in the last three years, have restored the legal system to a position where one’s legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> are related directly to one ‘s capacity to meet the cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will have no opportunity to take the necessary legal action which would enable them to obtain their legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> from the financial institutions and those who, as part of their normal business practice- I say that quite clearly- defend unethical and sometimes illegal practices by forcing the maximum and excessive use of the courts so as to raise the cost of challenging those practices beyond what the ordinary person can reasonably risk in case he loses the legal point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The document goes on to suggest that the whole question of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> has to be put over and against the tendency of the Australian community to put economic interest- mining interests- over and against the interests of a particular people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The agreement that I have just tabled has been the result of a lengthy negotiating process with the Commonwealth within the terms of section 44 sub-section (2) of the Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Through an amendment to the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act, the Northern Land Council has been given standing in the Northern Territory Supreme Court to seek an injunction against the mining operators should it feel that environmental conditions are not being observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister is well aware of the traditional methods of consultation of Aboriginal people and of the significance of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-40-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The procedures were praised by the parliamentary select committee on Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> … an anthropologist, a site survey officer and a linguist <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-40-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister several times in his speech referred to various sections of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-40-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has completely rejected the matter of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, on which he has written so eloquently in the  Northern Territory News. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-40-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Justice  Woodward in the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission Report of 1974 indicated that he could see no reason why areas should not be both owned as Aboriginal Land and declared as national park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The documents tabled today give effect to this new and innovative concept which acknowledges that the granting of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> to Aboriginals and the management of that land as a park are in fact compatible land uses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would not be at all surprised if it went to that point because I believe, and I know that the honourable member for Hughes believes, that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the ordinary individual must be protected by honourable members of good will on both sides of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any honourable member who genuinely believes that the power of the Executive should be restricted or who believes in the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals should stand firm and say that this proposed new section 57 ( 1) has within it an incentive for poison pen letters, tittle tattle, hearsay and backstabbing attacks on members of the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are quite satisfied that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual are fully protected under these provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If, like the Prime Minister, one were a dedicated anarch-capitalist who relished an Ayn Rand-type society where governments exist only to police the property <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the very wealthy, maybe one would applaud the Government’s methods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Is he able to say whether in the past when important visitors have gone to the USSR, such as President Nixon in 1972 and 1974, the Soviet Government has placed in custody a large number of persons who may have protested against Soviet violations of basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span>; if so, has this included recall of other dissidents for further psychiatric treatment in political hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the position is as stated, will he seek assurances from the Soviet Government that it will cease to place in custody the large number of persons who may protest against the Soviet Government’s violation of basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> during the forthcoming 1980 Olympic Games. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is unable to say that a correlation exists between actions taken by the Soviet authorities against persons campaigning for human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the USSR and the timing of prospective visits by prominent foreign leaders to the USSR. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The issue of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Soviet Union is one which has drawn the particular attention of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has called on the Soviet Union to implement the important principles of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> embodied in United Nations instruments as well as the 197S Helsinki Accords. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s stand on human <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be maintained into 1980 (when the Olympic Games are to be held in Moscow) and for as long as basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> are denied in the Soviet Union or elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister examine all relevant Commonwealth laws to determine whether any <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms conferred on any citizen by those laws will prevail over any attempted subtraction from the citizen’s right to personal freedom or freedom of assembly by the laws of the State of Queensland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In respect of 1978-79 the two major airlines have agreed to waive their <span class="highlight">rights</span> under clause 8 of the 1961 Agreement and to permit a 15 per cent increase in air navigation charges for this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By the end of World War II all European countries had introduced basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> to maternity leave benefits and employment security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government members have put themselves on record as supporting women’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the equality of women, giving women opportunity and a decent go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of withdrawing provisions which certainly were not generous when compared with those operating in other countries, the Government should be facilitating the establishment of maternity and paternity leave provisions in the private sector; providing adequate child care facilities instead of reversing advances made by the Labor Government in this area; exploring ways of providing adequate permanent part-time work for government employees with young families, and encouraging the private sector to follow suit; and, finally, investigating the effects of making provision for easier re-entry or retention of career <span class="highlight">rights</span> for women who stay out of the work force longer to look after children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Turning to a more serious aspect of this subject, I endorse the comments of the honourable member for Macquarie  (Mr Gillard)  who pointed out that the Government is not stripping away the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to take leave of women in the Public Service who fall pregnant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been no offers and I am not aware of any overtures by Honeywell or any other foreign company for the acquisition of <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the Mulloka system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I consider that under the Constitution any judicial interpretation on what are our <span class="highlight">rights</span> belong to this House alone and to no other body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whose <span class="highlight">rights</span> are at stake in this dispute? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the small businessman are at stake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the matter involves the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the small businessmen of the community to carry out their normal activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it involves the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other unionists in the Transport Workers Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter affects not only the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other unionists in the Transport Workers Union but also the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other unionists throughout the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the public are also involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an attack by certain people against the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other members of their union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter concerning the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other people in the community- people who have to observe industrial awards- to carry out their business in the way in which they see fit but within the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not sticking up for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of small businessmen who want to carry on their activities and who want to be free to work in an honest way to secure their own livelihoods and to make the wheels of industry turn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not sticking up for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of other unionists in the Transport Workers Union who, probably traditionally have been supporters of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members of the Labor Opposition are not sticking up for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members of the public to go about their ordinary affairs in their motor vehicles, to go about their affairs concerned with their businesses, with their family activities or for purposes of their own pleasure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the public ought to have some standing in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members of the Labor Opposition are not sticking up for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all members of the Australian community to have the economy improve and to have it continue on its upswing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the House support the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual workers and of all citizens involved in the Australian economy to be able to go about their businesses and to conduct their affairs in a normal and peaceful way, without intimidation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It shows the intelligence of this Government to suggest that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual must always be maintained, yet from the point of view of conscientious objection no judicial test of its validity has been put in the Government’s legislation; no union can test it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Australians have <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australians also have obligations, and those obligations are brought about by the fact the people do have <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not intend to make comments on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or wrongs of the dispute between that Association and the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I am perturbed that a responsible industrial organisation- an organisation which ardently believes in freedom of speech and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the media to report without fear or favour- should take action aimed not at the Government but at the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the public to enter Parliament House with the minimum of inconvenience, to criticise Parliament, parliamentarians, governments and Oppositions, to demonstrate without undue inconvenience to other members of the public and to exercise their hard won right of a free and secret vote are too precious to allow them to be lost by the inaction of Parliament itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essential element ofthe second article in each Agreement is that the land on which the facility was constructed remains vested in the Australian Government, which accords to the US Government all necessary <span class="highlight">rights</span> of access to, and use and occupation of the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-25-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that quite apart from reason and consultation, the processes of conciliation have to be backed on occasions by the force of law to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual working men and women of Australia and to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all citizens in this country against the predatory actions of some union leaders in some circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that is a measure that significantly protects the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of certain Australian individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The recent use of section  45d  was a classic example of the way in which that provision is used by an employer to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of his own employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore the action under section 45d was encompassed to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a number of Aus.tralian working people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Other aspects of the scheme which require clarification relate to supposed mandatory requirements for the payment of royalties to the Commonwealth, and for the acquisition of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to grant-assisted research and development when a company decides to terminate a project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I draw attention to this table because of the questions raised in the Second Asian Agricultural Survey, which is a survey dealing with the impact of rural development projects which it says has ignored the basic questions of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and employment in rural areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The three principles to which I have referred relate to unemployment, land tenure- the question of tenancy being too high- and the disproportionate gap that is everwidening between those people who have land and those who have no <span class="highlight">rights</span> to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will see just how frequently not a single member of the Liberal Party or the National Country Party attends meetings of that sub-committee, which was set up following a resolution of this chamber to investigate the question of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The resolution that was passed last weekend by the Victorian conference of the Australian Labor Party to which the honourable member referred, states quite clearly the Labor Party’s support for human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in all countries and condemns attacks on those human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, whether they occur in totalitarian regimes of the Right or the Left. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is on a substantive matter, is addressed to the Prime Minister and is subsequent to a number of petitions I have presented to the House concerning human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Prime Minister inform the House of the Government’s attitude towards the Soviet Union’s attempts to deny the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of those of its citizens wishing to exercise the democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of free expression and peaceful dissent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have urged the Soviet Union to implement important principles of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> embodied in the Helsinki Accords, and if that could occur I am quite certain that the thrust for peace throughout the world would be enormously strengthened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker,  in view of answers given at Question Time, I ask whether you will investigate why an undertaking was given by the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Soviet Union that no members of the Joint Foreign Affairs and Defence Sub-Committee on Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in the Soviet Union would be included in any parliamentary delegation to the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made reference to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and to the sub-committee which is chaired by  Senator Wheeldon  and which is currently investigating human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Delegates voted that ‘support for human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and dignity is a fundamental principle of Labor foreign policy and that the ALF is opposed to all forms of authoritarian and totalitarian Government whether based on the ideologies of the Left or the Right’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House may be assured that I and other spokesmen of that Branch- I am the  President-  continue to be concerned at any erosion of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> or liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response to a question which was asked at Question Time and which related to the matter of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Russia and a recent decision of the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labor Party, the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  challenged me to make a statement dissociating myself from that decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implication was that if I did not make a statement dissociating myself from that policy decision, it would be interpreted as evidence that I was not concerned or was not opposing the onslaught against human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They condemn the onslaught against human <span class="highlight">rights</span> by any authoritarian and totalitarian government, whether based on the ideology of the Left or the Right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have gone on public record several times quite recently condemning the onslaught against dissidents in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics but also pointing out that there are extensive erosions of basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in just about every country within our own geopolitical region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be consistent, we would have to raise concern about those matters in specific terms if we are to set upon a campaign of condemning other countries in relation to the abuse of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, on the same grounds as my colleague the honourable member for McMillan  (Mr Simon)  which related to the attendance at the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence which is investigating human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made generalised allegations that members on this side of the House were not concerned about the question of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people in the Parliament are not aware of the strange way in which the law moves; are not aware of how the electoral laws of this country affect the electoral responsibilities of candidates and of members and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ask nothing more than that a parliamentary committee should look at those laws, should see the way in which reform is required to bring about some sense to them, especially those laws which honourable members know are frustrating the proper <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens of this country and are being ignored by those of us who stand as candidates for our respective political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It covers all the matters affecting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens, lt is an enormously important document, following upon the Constitution, in seeing that civil liberties are available- for example, the right to elect or not elect a party in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  Government likes to maintain a high profile posture on questions of political processes and human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Government does nothing about the undemocratic political processes in Australia or about human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth does have such power under the external affairs power in the light of the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question of Australia exhibiting all the political instability of a banana republic is equally as vital as that of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In order to take appropriate account of requirements for security of tenure and, in addition, the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act, the recent agreement with the Northern Land Council in respect of Ranger, and the Memorandum of Understanding, the resulting provisions in this Bill are somewhat involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sub-section (2) provides that the existing Northern Land Council agreement must be extended, or a new agreement under section 44 of the Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act entered into, before the entitlement to a new authority becomes effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bills also seek to plug a blatant tax loophole regarding the repatriation of profits by foreign companies operating in Australia as branches of their parent company; to protect the revenue against a recent court decision which threatens to reduce tax revenue greatly unless counteraction is taken; and they implement the concession on capital investment in Australian film <span class="highlight">rights</span> to encourage investment by Australians in the production of Australian films. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment will not apply in respect of assessments yet to be raised in respect of earlier years and it will not apply to assessments already raised in respect of the 1977-78 and prior years where the taxpayer’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> are protected by way of objection or appeal to a court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly, these measures will allow capital investment in Australian film <span class="highlight">rights</span> to be written off over a two-year period, instead of, as at present, over a much longer period of up to 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a valid argument that as far as possible the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of taxpayers should be spelt out in income tax legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first question is this: Should we as an Australian nation, a major contributor to and supporter of the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Development Fund, place a human <span class="highlight">rights</span> tag on our commitment, which this year is worth $96.8m? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To do otherwise would be to support financially national administrations whose policies are directed against the recognition of basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is perfectly proper that the Australian nation and, indeed, the Parliament representing the people of Australia, should bring to bear all means at our disposal to bring about an appreciation of and a respect for basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in our Asian neighbours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  straightened it out when he said that the resolution condemned the onslaught against human <span class="highlight">rights</span> by any authoritarian or totalitarian government, whether based on the ideology of the Left or the Right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: Has the Government an attitude on barter arrangements between China and an Australian exporting firm such as those that have existed with a number of British exporters for whom marketing <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Great Britain were reserved exclusively by China following the use of the original British technology? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yesterday during Question Time in this House we heard the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  call for human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Soviet Union, a nation as far from Australia’s influence as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But since his Government took office it has been noted for fine words and not for inspiring actions to promote the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the original trustees of his own country, its own Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He does not have the courage to stand up for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people he is supposed to serve, either by defying the Prime Minister as  Senator Bonner  did on one occasion or by defying the Cabinet, his Party Caucus, his mining mates or whoever it is who makes his promises a pose and who makes his credibility a high vacuum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Land Council has to go through the procedures that are very clearly laid down in the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation to consult with the traditional owners and obtain their consent before any action is taken and also to consult with any Aboriginal communities which may be affected by the agreement and this is what is going to happen from now on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clearly section 23 of the Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act has not been complied with, but any legal action would have to be taken by the traditional owners at Oenpelli, and the Aboriginal people are tired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Originally some sections of the Government and even some sections of the Labor Party considered giving to Aborigines what might be called basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation which was introduced in 1975 there was some hint of endeavouring to do for Aborigines some of the things which were recommended by the Woodward report which, incidentally, was never debated or discussed in any parliamentary forum in this land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those people who introduced the original land <span class="highlight">rights</span> Act did not appreciate the Aboriginal approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the Labor Party introduced its land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation in 1975 it has been approaching Aborigines for purely political purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While the matters subject to direction are specified in the Bill as a clear indication of the Government’s intention to preserve contributors’ <span class="highlight">rights</span>, I am hopeful that organisations will administer their rules in a manner which will result in the activation of the ministerial powers of direction being required only in exceptional circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a procedural device to bolster the position of the Leader of the Opposition who realises not only his lack lustre performance during the past 12 months but also that the clouds of ideological differences within his own party, as illustrated by the motions on human <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labor Party and the resolutions of other sections of the Labor Party, will come home to haunt him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill contains some very reaonable provisions in the areas in which it protects the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal land councils and reflects some of the provisions of the agreement with the Northern Land Council on Ranger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am concerned that there has been a decline in milling activity and exploration in the Northern Territory since the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act came into force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that the agreement was produced in violation of section 23(3) of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If therefore the Government proceeds to act on the basis of an agreement made under duress, by the Northern Land Council or by an arbitrator, without it being subjected to the processes required to develop a consensus, the Government and its partners in the ventures are likely to encounter situations in which individual Aborigines or groups of Aborigines who feel their <span class="highlight">rights</span> are being infringed will, in all good conscience, act in conflict with the terms of that agreement Such situations can be productive of grievance, hostility, and, potentially, violence and will damage further the already eroded confidence of Aborigines and their friends among white Australians in the Government’s expressed concern for Aboriginal welfare and undertakings to protect their interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Proposed new section 14 provides that a grant is not payable unless the amount of the export earnings in the grant year exceeds $25,000 or, if the whole of that amount consists of consideration for the disposal of eligible industrial property <span class="highlight">rights</span> or eligible know-how, $10,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The firm exported its second division toy technology to China; the toys and the goods are to be made in China, in return for which it retains the marketing <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Great Britain and in a number of other European countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Were such barter deals to exist between Australian exporting firms and China, the first question would be: What <span class="highlight">rights</span> will exist for the exporting firm to market, similarly to what the Dunbee Corporation has done, those goods in this nation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has referred to the problem which we see in relation to clause 10 sub-clause (3) of the Bill which seems to indicate that, in relation to the value of exports coming from the sale of industrial property <span class="highlight">rights</span> or eligible know-how, if the amount is $10,000 someone would be eligible for consideration of a grant But the point is that the clause says now that the whole of those earnings must be from the sale of industrial property <span class="highlight">rights</span> or eligible know-how. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition quite rightly pointed out, this puts a person who has extra export earnings from another source in a particular difficulty if the total export earnings lie between $10,000 and $25,000 and may make that person ineligible even though he has $10,000 worth of export earnings coming from the sale of industrial property <span class="highlight">rights</span> or eligible know-how. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“(3) Where a person, other than an approved body, received, or became entitled to receive, grants in respect of eligible expenditure incurred by him during any 3 or more grant years preceding a particular grant year, a grant is not payable to him in respect of eligible expenditure incurred by him during that grant year unless the amount of his export earnings in that grant year exceeds $25,000 or, if the whole of that amount consist of consideration for the disposal of eli- gible industrial property <span class="highlight">rights</span> or eligible know-how, 10,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in respect of export earnings consisting of consideration for the disposal of eligible industrial property <span class="highlight">rights</span> or eligible knowhow, such earnings exceed $10,000; or <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time, the Bill is defective in that it provides $25,000 or if the whole of that amount consists of consideration for the disposal of eligible industrial property <span class="highlight">rights</span>, or eligible know-how, $ 10,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not the intention to exclude a claimant who had exports of eligible industrial property <span class="highlight">rights</span> and know-how in excess of $10,000, but who also had other export earnings, the combined total of which did not exceed $25,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What a day of shame for Australia when one of the two major political parties in the State of Victoria came out publicly and refused to condemn the Soviet Union for its treatment of civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> dissidents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will read from the Melbourne  Sun  on the Monday afterwards, Monday, 13 November, in an article headed ‘Surprise rebuff on Red <span class="highlight">rights</span>’: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether the honourable member for Melbourne Ports emphasised the importance of standing up on the question of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and having the ALP adopt an honourable course and support the decision of its administrative commi ttee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We faced issues relating to sovereignty and sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> and special legal and humanitarian problems which involved important national interests for each country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treaty will establish clearly the division of sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> over resources between Australia and Papua New Guinea in the whole area between them- from the Arafura Sea to the Coral Sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Problems will arise because of the number of people involved and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are the questions of traditional fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span>, seabed resources and territorial seas around islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The islanders could have obtained independent advice as to their present and future <span class="highlight">rights</span> and their entitlements in respect of future development of any resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is understood that the normal traditional fishing <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear, arising from that, that there has to be a continuing process because it has got to deal not only with the Islanders’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> as they now are and the maintenance of those <span class="highlight">rights</span> as they must be maintained; there also has to be the future situation as to what problems may arise and how they are best dealt with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not attracted-  Mr Deputy Speaker,  I hope you do not take personal umbrage at this- to the fact that the Queensland Government in our view is not noted for its ability to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It makes the point at times that it proposes to intrude into the issues of what are people ‘s <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is very important when dealing with this on a national basis with another government, as we are, that if there is to be a question of future <span class="highlight">rights</span>, that that be the subject of negotiations and discussionsconsultation certainly between both governments- but with the advice and consent of the people concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not good enough to have national <span class="highlight">rights</span> protected by treaties, or the subject of negotiation by treaties, to be the subject of what we would say are some of the appalling decisions that have been made by Queensland Government officials in the past and at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said those things and having adverted to the fact that we applaud the progress that has been made between our two governments, we hope that the future for the Torres Strait Islanders is a bright one in the sense that their future will be one of progress and that they will have the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of determination which must be recognised and have not to the present been recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I would take up the point he made about the support for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people by the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He insisted at all times that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people must be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under that scheme, a taxpayer obtains a loan of $1,000, promptly pays $700 as a pre-payment of interest, and then buys back, or has an associate buy back, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the loan for $370. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most importantly, how is the average contributor to be made aware of his <span class="highlight">rights</span> to appeal to the Minister to direct the funds? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say in passing that I hope the Grants Commission, in determining grants in the future, will not give such dispersal of police services any added weight because of the Government’s periodic calling in of police from outlying areas to Brisbane to prevent people undertaking their democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> to march in protest through that city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the type of behaviour that was displayed in Adelaide is any indication, one can see that at future major hearings representatives, whether they be of commercial television stations, commercial radio stations or indeed the public broadcasting sector, will have to have legal counsel to work out their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There have been no achievements in that area, except the watering down of the Labor Government Bill, making less broad land <span class="highlight">rights</span> harder to obtain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-44-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The issue of an exploration licence or rnining interest has no effect on the lodgement of land claims as, under the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act, the issue of such a licence or interest does not constitute an alienation of the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-57-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act, a Land Council is required, in carrying out its functions in relation to a particular area of land, to have regard to the interests of, and to consult with,  inter aiia,  the traditional Aboriginal owners (if any) of the land, and in particular not to take any action unless the Land Council is satisfied that the traditional owners of the land understand the nature and purpose of the proposed action and as a group consent to it (see section 23(3)). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-57-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no definition of, or other reference to, a ‘custodian’ in the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Act The term has sometimes been used in various ways referring both to the traditional Aboriginal owners of sites and to other persons who have some traditional responsibilities in relation to sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-57-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Has his attention been drawn to an article in the  Sunday Telegraph  of 12 November 1978 which states that motorists who break any of the Queensland traffic laws, while driving in that State with a licence issued in another State, receive letters from the Secretary of the Queensland Transport Department reminding them that driving a motor vehicle in Queensland on a driver’s licence issued in another State or country is a privilege, and warning them that if they are convicted again of a breach of the Queensland traffic laws, their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to drive in Queensland could be revoked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-50-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is extraordinary that the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  can describe himself as a small ‘1’ Liberal, yet make an important speech here reviewing major trouble spots in the world, and especially those in our region, but never once mention the issues of civil liberties and human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Several members of this regional community have been roundly castigated by Amnesty for their disregard of human rightsIndonesia and the Philippines are among thembut, there has not been a single word of concern from the Foreign Affairs Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I raised the point that the Soviet Union indicated to this country last year that it would invite a parliamentary delegation to visit that country only on the basis that no members of the Joint Foreign Affairs and Defence Sub-committee on Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in the Soviet Union would be on that delegation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden),  making this time a read speech, said that the Minister had not said a single word about human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Seas and Submerged Lands Case, the complete sovereign power and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Commonwealth Parliament over off-shore areas of Australia, that is from low water mark outwards, was affirmed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill makes appropriate provisions preserving existing <span class="highlight">rights</span> to appeal to the High Court under the taxation legislation and to preserve the jurisdiction of the High Court in respect of proceedings instituted in the High Court at the date on which the relevant provisions of the Bill are brought into operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clauses 125 to 128 of the Bill provide for the High Court to remit pending proceedings or proceedings arising out of <span class="highlight">rights</span> of appeal accrued at the date the Bill comes into operation to a State or Territory supreme court having jurisdiction in that proceeding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it also- and I repeat that I state all this so that I can be corrected if I am wrong before giving the Opposition’s attitude to the Bill- at the same time the Bill preserves the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of competitors and consumers by limiting the initial term of a petty patent to 12 months with, as I mentioned earlier, those extensions to six years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, Labor- I am now referring to the industrial wing as well as the political wing of the labour movement; in other words, the Australian Labor Party and the unions- recognises only too well the vital necessity to strike a balance between the need to maintain a labour intensive industry with high technology and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of consumers to the best and cheapest cars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it needs a government which is nationalistic in outlook- not lapdogs, not sycophants of large companies- to exert our <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this way and obtain signed guarantees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do we proceed to expand human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and how do we overcome the obsession with sovereignty which, of course, stops us from acting over most of the world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am more convinced than ever before, after observing the man at close quarters following two intensive meetings involving a deliberation in excess of six hours, that in that office he combines a judicial appreciation of the rule of law under a parliamentary democracy, together with an understanding of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual Australian and of the necessity to ensure the national security of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms of the Australian people are the most jealously guarded in the Western world and are the envy of many nations both near to and far from our shores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that I would have the support of my friend, the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes)  in saying that the Bill in no way interferes with the substantive <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those who have access to the provisions of the two Acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This covers the situation of a trust that is accumulating money from an overseas source so that the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> exist in respect of trusts as exist in respect of an individual who is accumulating profits from an overseas investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some honourable members might say that this could offend aspects of civil liberties and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These schemes involved the taxpayer obtaining a tax deduction for prepayments of interest on a loan which is artificial in that it is then effectively cancelled by the taxpayer buying back the <span class="highlight">rights</span> in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that purpose, there is no requirement of reciprocal <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the foreign country in respect of Australian judgments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether at common law or under the State or Territory legislation, the recognition and enforcement <span class="highlight">rights</span> for foreign judgments are not unlimited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of unsuccessful appellants to seek reopening of their cases by presentation of further evidence and the right of appellants to have access to information in the records relating to their case were inserted in the 1929 Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While incorporating these present day principles for the review of administrative decisions, the Bill seeks to retain the best elements of the existing system- in particular those elements which confer upon applicants special <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Tribunal will be empowered to hear and dispose of those applications without the need for the applicant himself to take any action to preserve his <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I also emphasise that the essential principles of the repatriation appeals system- those that have protected appellants and conferred upon them <span class="highlight">rights</span> to ensure that every opportunity is given to them to achieve justice- are being retained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us leave this matter to be dealt with according to the law and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people rather than point to some nebulous scheme to solve a problem about which Opposition members have no knowledge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People voted for the Fraser Government on promises of a better future, but what they are getting is coming to the surface by a sort of flotation process- grievances, questionable personal dealings, internal turmoil, resignations, patchups and cover-ups- with a total disregard for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of this Parliament to know why a Minister of the Cabinet resigned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will recall that Australia welcomed through a statement of the Prime Minister, joined as I recall by the Leader of the Opposition, the two agreements signed after the Camp David meeting as a constructive framework for resolution of the Middle East conflict based on the provisions and principles of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 and the legitimate <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Palestinian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For a party that at one stage liked to speak of the privacy of the individual and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual, the Labor Party has demonstrated anything but a preparedness to comply with those sorts of restraints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In keeping with the Government’s commitment to civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> and administrative justice, this Bill seeks to provide a proper legislative basis for passport policy and a clear legislative framework for the exercise of ministerial discretion, which must continue to be an essential element in the administration of this difficult area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has signified its recognition of this right by endorsement of the Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> of 1948. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the not too distant past, it was argued that the need to carry a passport was an infringement of basic <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This imposes on the Government a responsibility to ensure, so far as it can, that passports are not issued to persons likely to threaten the national security and public order of another country or the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and welfare of its citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware that this policy has caused inconvenience and even distress on some occasions, but I have found it necessary to retain it as a practical means of protecting the financial <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a spouse or former spouse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in recognition of the Government’s policy relating to human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the view that the Passport Act should neither be used as an extension of the judicial system nor be expected to impose any more restraint on an individual than a court would be prepared to impose, this practice will be discontinued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In brief, these are, with certain exceptions, persons who are not married and who have not reached the age of 18 years, unless the consent of persons having custodial <span class="highlight">rights</span> has been obtained; persons in respect of whom the authorised officer has reason to believe that there is in force a warrant for arrest issued in Australia; persons whom the authorised officer has reason to believe are required to remain in Australia under a court order, or under a condition of parole or of recognisance, surety or bail bond; persons who owe money to the Commonwealth as a result of circumstances arising from previous overseas travel; persons whom the authorised officer believes already to be in possession or control of an Australian passport in force- unless there are special reasons- and persons in respect of whom the Minister has decided that issue of a passport would threaten security or welfare in another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet that person’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> to benefits are considerably less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true to say that those <span class="highlight">rights</span> are now a fading vision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the changing circumstances in the general community, the decisions we make concerning the benefit <span class="highlight">rights</span> of servicemen in relation to the rest of the community may well be irrelevant in 5, 10 or 15 years time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a general way, I believe that where major sporting telecasts are won by commercial organisations which cover only part of the country, it is important for the ABC to be able to secure <span class="highlight">rights</span> to cover those parts of the country which are not covered by commercial organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The learned Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen)  mentioned a moment ago that we have a plethora of parliamentary committees; but we do not have any committees dealing with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people and how the laws we pass affect them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is a wide range of such <span class="highlight">rights</span>, but honourable members will notice that the thrust of what I am saying today relates to a proper system of legal aid and the question of people having human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only weakness in having a Bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> is that another government can do away with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Much stronger emphasis would be placed on human <span class="highlight">rights</span> if those <span class="highlight">rights</span> were entrenched in the Constitution, which they should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think every Australian would ask: Why do we not have the <span class="highlight">rights</span> set out in the Constitution? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There have been legal decisions that clearly indicate that the elementary right of one vote one value does not apply in Australia, yet that is contrary to the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> covenant in regard to what is called equal suffrage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one looked at the most stringent tests which were recently announced regarding eligibility for legal aid one would see that we are not giving any real substance to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a citizen in this regard because he will not have a chance to get any lawyer to represent him or to prepare his case in such a way as to enable him to be able to stand up against all the resources of a bureaucracy or government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One matter that has been brought to my attention- it obviously was not in my mind when I first put this motion on the Notice Paper- goes right to the whole question of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst in the body of the report there is stress on the need for land <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the central importance of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aborigines to regain their self-identity, which is essential to achieving a healthy life, a healthy community and a healthy individual, that was not listed among the principal recommendations of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to put on record, and I believe that this view is shared by the other members of the Committee, that we see land <span class="highlight">rights</span> as being essential to the ability of Aborigines to return to their source of spiritual refreshment and social cohesion, that is, the land with which they identify in a very complex and important manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matters raised in this Bill are matters of great concern to every citizen of this nation because they affect the basic legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> of every man, woman and child in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly far more expensive than a one-man centralist dictatorship, which is a very cheap form of government, but for the preservation of basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> and for a country as widely diverse as Australia the Federal system in my judgment is the only system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The proposal of the Leader of the Opposition to use section 51 (xxix), the external affairs power, in relation to a Bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> not only raises some serious legal and constitutional problems but also is totally at odds with the philosphy and policy I have outlined, which is designed to work in harmony and co-operation with the States, and also in a way that protects the basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States to the extent that that is possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it also overlooks the fact that we have already legislated in a number of areas to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens and will continue to do so where there is a need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Ombudsman, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and other provisions are areas where the Commonwealth has shown concern for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual citizens against, for example, what can sometimes be regarded as a large, powerful and hard to understand bureaucracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Protection for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals in a modern society I think is necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are also quite well advanced at officer and ministerial levels in developing co-operative Commonwealth-State human <span class="highlight">rights</span> machinery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Is the Prime Minister aware of a statement made in 1 977 by the former Attorney-General, the present Minister for Home Affairs, that human <span class="highlight">rights</span> should be the same all over the country, and of a further statement which reads: ‘We ought to be able to get together on this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of those statements and the statement of the Prime Minister today that the Commonwealth would not use the external affairs power under the Constitution to enact a Bill of <span class="highlight">rights</span> which guarantees the provision of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> by all States throughout Australia by the end of this year, will the Prime Minister guarantee that such <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be brought into operation shortly rather than wait a further two years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicated that negotiations were already well advanced at both officer and ministerial level to develop co-operative Commonwealth-State human <span class="highlight">rights</span> machinery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one can easily live with the judgments of Menhennitt and Levine which determine the legality of abortions in the States, one cannot logically believe that a separate life begins at conception and, therefore, one must believe that abortion on demand does not impinge on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of anyone but the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that this evidence dictates the right of the foetus to be born, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the mother and the obligations of doctors and legislators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my view, based on my belief that a separate life follows conception, that the right of the foetus to be born transcends all other <span class="highlight">rights</span>, excepting the most extreme cases of risk of the life of the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all the recent criticism of this motion regarding women’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> and doctors’ responsibilities not one critic has yet put in a plea for the foetus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regarding the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the unborn, I think in this year, the International Year of the Child, when we are celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the adoption by the United Nations of the Declaration of the <span class="highlight">Rights</span> of the Child, we should have a close look at that Declaration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly from the passages I have quoted from the Geneva and United Nations declarations it can be seen that the obligations of the medical profession and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the unborn sit together and together constitute an obligation for legislators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are other <span class="highlight">rights</span> to consider also- the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the pregnant woman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we accept that the foetus lives, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of both the foetus and the mother cannot be protected at once; and I give my priority to the unrepresented and unprotected unborn, with the exception stipulated in the motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fewer and fewer can be justified in terms of strict medical necessity, in terms of morality or in terms of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations of all parties to the procedure; and these arguments should all determine our attitude to funding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have raised other questions relating to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and obligations of the parties involved in an abortion and they lead me to conclude that this Parliament has an obligation to act within its constitutional constraints to restrict the payment of medical benefits for unnecessary abortions as this is the only way we can challenge what has become a massive abuse of the sanctity of human life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From these cases, it must be accepted that there is a rule of law which recognises that an unborn child may possess <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also implies that an unborn child is deemed to be a ‘person’ where the right is for his benefit, so if he survives his binh and obtains the requisite capacity to institute proceedings for an infringement of his <span class="highlight">rights</span>, he may do so and obtain a remedy for the infringement when he was en ventre sa mere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the various cases, as was pointed out, by Cozens.Hardy M. R. the unborn child’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> were considered separate and distinct from the mother’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We consider that the abovementioned judgment is authority for the proposition that the unborn child is recognised by law as a person separate from his/her mother and is the possessor of <span class="highlight">rights</span> under law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recognition of the unborn child as a separate legal person with legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> which are enforceable on birth must mean that the law also recognises that that legal person cannot be deprived deliberately of its life by being aborted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a State <span class="highlight">rights</span> matter as to whether the laws of the State should allow or disallow abortion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It forces women into a specific position of oppression in this society in that they are denied their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to control their own bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third is that in matters of fundamental importance, such as security of life and limb, all members of society have equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> and claims upon society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But over and above that, we believe that the Australian Parliament as the custodian of civil liberties and human values has a responsibility when dealing with human <span class="highlight">rights</span> such as the public funding of abortions to consider the effect that decisions reached in this Parliament will have not only on this generation but also on future generations of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It makes me sick to hear some of the hypocrisy that comes from the mouths of men about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of women to control their own bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clarification Bill debated here on 10 May 1973, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> were preserved when pregnancy had reached a period of 23 weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I made the point on that occasion that the fundamental question was whether the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of an unborn child should be recognised during the whole or only part of a pregnancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nub of the problem is that the community does not agree on precisely what so-called <span class="highlight">rights</span>’ should be accorded to a woman and the foetus she might be carrying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Right To Life Association expresses with great militancy its conviction that the alleged ‘<span class="highlight">rights</span>’ of the foetus prevail over those of the woman carrying it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problems are far more complex than that Association acknowledges and the foetal <span class="highlight">rights</span> it claims have never been recognised by law in that simple manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that this Parliament and other parliamentary forums around the world can be quite justifiably accused of hypocrisy for the way in which we condemn one form of denial of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and then ignore what is happening in countries like Uganda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to remind the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Adermann)  that the Opposition will not oppose the motion although I think that to preserve the integrity of this Parliament it would be wise on occasions such as this for us to use the forms of the House to ensure that Ministers understand that they often trample upon the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all members of the House, particularly members of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because ours is a free society of many differing views, because there exists among persons of goodwill a genuine difference of opinion concerning the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a foetus in its early stage of development and because all people I respect support, among other appropriate and relevant statements, the Catholic Church’s Second Vatican Council Declaration on Religious Freedom, I find myself, as a parliamentary representative, unable to support legislation, which makes criminals of those who do not share my faith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>After years of devoted study of abortion law versus choice morality, Callahan found it necessary, reluctantly, to choose permissive abortion as the only type of abortion law which recognises women’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> over their own bodies, but not absolute <span class="highlight">rights</span> because due regard must be given to the foetus and to society, and which upholds the dignity of the law by not allowing it to fall into disrepute, as laws prohibiting abortion do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if we move away from that principle there will be no end to a progressive weakening of community values and attitudes towards the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of human beings to choose for themselves their very existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the end of the day these arguments of the quality of life for both parents and children and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of women have to be weighed on the scales against the principle of the right of human beings to be born, provided the safety of the mother’s life is not at issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first concerns the timing of this matter and the extent of debate available; the second concerns the economics of the proposition to which he has devoted a great deal of” attention; and the third concerns the health <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, if one wants to talk about financial comparisons, or crudely and vulgarly about the economics of the matter and ignore <span class="highlight">rights</span>, then the economics are dead against the proposition which has been put forward by the honourable member for Hume and overwhelm the arguments that he has put in support of that proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to move on to the health <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people because for me that is the most important proposition involved in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They might then have more sensitivity about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place, any expression of its views is not only irrelevant in that it does not have legislative power to take a moral legislative view on abortion, but also any attempts to do so would involve a subversion of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of sovereign States in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The case against abortion on demand is a strong one, but it has not been strong enough to sway the legislators in those governments which have the sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> to legislate on this matter, or indeed to enforce existing legislation that is honoured more in the breach than in the observance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is improper for anyone to endeavour to use this House to subvert the sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the States by imposing a discriminatory restraint on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals to have abortions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Parliament which decides the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and wrongs of whether they should take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a shame the organisers of this enormous campaign have chosen to direct their power towards getting an expression of opinion and nothing more from a parliament with no <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the matter, rather than to do something that would be practical and useful to its cause; that is, to influence the State parliaments to either introduce additional laws in respect of abortion, or to impose and make certain the existing laws work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third is that in matters of fundamental importance, such as security of life and limb, all members of society have equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> and claims upon society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is the duty of this Parliament and of this nation to recognise that for too long in the abortion debate the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the foetus have been ignored and overlooked by people who were duty bound to uphold those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I fully recognise the logic and the sincerity of the point of view put by honourable members who have taken in this debate a view different from my own, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the mother should be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today’s vote in this Parliament is the first step to restoring here and now in the national Parliament some of the real values of human life, of saying to the community that we stand for those who have the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then again, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of women are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that none of us would readily say that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of women should not be taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an honest and conscientious legislator I have to say that although I embrace the Menhennitt ruling, although I am against abortion, and although I understand the sanctity of the foetus, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of women and the social implications of abortion, I cannot in conscience support the motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once born, no matter how prematurely, I accept that the individual has all the <span class="highlight">rights</span> most or all of us assume it has, even though a new born baby, and particularly a premature baby, in a practical sense is totally dependent on another person or other people, not necessarily its natural mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before birth we are confronted with a pregnant woman who also has <span class="highlight">rights</span>, <span class="highlight">rights</span> that might be in conflict with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the foetus she carries within her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My assumption is that the carrying mother’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> are paramount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The responsibility rests with those opposed to free abortions- that includes me- to have the States enact new statutes dealing with abortions or to test the Menhennitt and Levine rulings in the Supreme Courts of the various States to establish in good law the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the foetus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They have <span class="highlight">rights</span> and other human beings have responsibilities towards them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is preposterous and pretentious for us to be pontificating about what <span class="highlight">rights</span> the other sex should have over their reproductive capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an all-female assembly were to pass laws, Lysistrata-like, determining the sexual <span class="highlight">rights</span> of males there would be considerable consternation among men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not ignore the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the foetus, but I cannot concede that a 3-week foetus has equivalent <span class="highlight">rights</span> to those of a 16 yearold girl. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we accept that the foetus lives, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of both the foetus and the mother cannot be protected at once; and I give my priority to the unrepresented and unprotected unborn, with the exception stipulated in the motion - that is: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that abortion must never ever be granted the mantle of legality, of respectability and of acceptance because, in the final analysis, I hold very dearly the consensus and the point of view that man can only protect his own <span class="highlight">rights</span> by conceding the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> to everyone else, particularly to those unable to defend themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately the law has not denned the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the unborn child, the least of which, surely, is the right to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of women are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If women continue to exercise their legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> to have abortions and some find that they cannot afford their own doctor or a private hospital without the assistance of the scheduled Commonwealth medical benefits, then, as many speakers have said, including the mover of the motion, they would have access to a public hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If my motion passes, the laws that apply in the States tomorrow will be no different from the laws that apply in the States today, no one’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be affected because no <span class="highlight">rights</span> are under challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We on this side of the House say that that sort of option should be written into properly negotiated treaties whereby Australia’s legal positions and obligations are clearly understood and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those countries with whom we would be seeking to act in unison would be clearly set out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-33-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said:  in recognition of the Government’s policy relating to human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the view that the Passport Act should neither be used as an extension of the judicial system nor be expected to impose any more restraint on an individual than a court would be prepared to impose, this practice will be discontinued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of this section is to ensure that the unmarried minor is not issued a passport without steps having been taken to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the child and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of persons who have custody or guardianship of or access to the child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the encompassing of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all those with custody, guardianship or access can draw in many people and can make the work of the passports office very complicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In keeping with the Government’s commitment to civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> and administrative justice, this Bill seeks to provide a proper legislative basis for passport policy and a clear legislative framework for the exercise of Ministerial discretion, which must continue to be an essential element in the administration of this difficult area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, I believe that it is necessary to retain that requirement for the practical means of protecting not only the financial <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a spouse or former spouse but also to guard against this situation of child abduction and removal from the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst it could be argued that the denial of travel facilities to extremists, terrorists and drug pedlars could be in violation of a basic human right, I believe that the risk to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of others that is posed by these persons is a more important consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In explanation, he said that in recognition of the Government’s policy in relation to human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and the view that the Passports Act should neither be an extension of the judicial system nor be expected to impose any more restraint on a person than a court would be prepared to impose, the Government decided to change the practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On a simple cost benefit analysis, the nil costs associated with the Minister’s power to withdraw or withhold a passport of a suspected corporate criminal as opposed to the expensive costs of extradition and the loss of investors’ money associated with corporate criminals who flee, it would seem that as a result of the proposed new practice in this Bill the Government and the Australian people are paying and will continue to pay a substantial price in the cause of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and civil liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not a simple question of hiding behind the twin screens, if you like, one being used as an extension of the judicial system and the other the policy relating to human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a very real civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> belief that to require finger-printing on passports might well transgress the general form of our community requirements in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Its only difficulty is that it intrudes to far too great a degree on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, I am putting strongly and forcibly- I again get back to the amendment proposed at the second reading stage- that there is an interference with a person ‘s <span class="highlight">rights</span> if he cannot have on his passport what he reasonably wants to have on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the principle of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> should be accepted in this situation but not to protect white collar criminals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar):  If he is concerned about human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and civil liberties- I confess that it is an area that has never bothered me- how many people have really suffered? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did they consider that this infringed human <span class="highlight">rights</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where has any company director subject to investigation by either a corporate affairs commission, an insurance office or the Taxation Office, had his civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> infringed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If their own leadership is not giving them that chance, this Government, through the action it is taking, undoubtedly will give a greater chance to the majority of workers to assert their views, their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and their aspirations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Deregistration can work only in situations such as we saw when the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia was deregistered and the carpenters and joiners came in and picked up the constitutional <span class="highlight">rights</span> which the deregistered union previously had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is possible that, in different circumstances from those which apply now, in the metal trades industry if the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union were deregistered, the Australasian Society of Engineers and the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia could move in and pick up the registered <span class="highlight">rights</span> which the AMWSU now has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This allows protection for the Commonwealth Government and, should objections on a States’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> basis be lodged they can be dealt with in this place or in the State parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In line with this philosophy the proposed amendment provides for a greater control over machinery matters of government for the proposed Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly; control over a much wider number of matters of government; a reduction in the Australian Government’s powers in the Bill; the provision of social security and an industrial court for Norfolk Island; the extension of Australian taxation legislation to Norfolk Island; a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> to be included in the Bill; and the proposed Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly to be elected by the fairest method to all concerned, in this instance proportional representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>that a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> for Norfolk Islanders be included in the Bill, ensuring, in particular, the recognition of the island as the historical homeland of the Pitcairners and the protection of their remaining <span class="highlight">rights</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Labor Party believes in a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> for all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is necessary that there be a special provision for the people of Norfolk Island, as an Australian Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> would fail to take into account the special <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the descendants of the Pitcairn Islanders who were given the island by Queen Victoria in 1865. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are discussing is not whether the island is to be more closely integrated into or to become a more remote part of the Australian scene, but how we can preserve the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people of Norfolk Island, the environment of Norfolk Island and the security of Norfolk Island and still retain it as part of the Australian scene with the advantages which that bestows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are on the island a group of people who have not accrued those <span class="highlight">rights</span> in some other country and it is proper that this Parliament and the Government here in Canberra should be concerned about the welfare and the security of those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Council of the Aboriginal Legal <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Movement in South Australia recently announced that, due to insufficient funds being made available by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, it is no longer able to provide legal aid to all Aborigines for all matters requiring legal assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Aboriginal Legal <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Movement was founded in 1970 in response to a situation in which a majority of Aborigines appearing before the courts had no legal representation at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the period from 1973 to 1978, the Aboriginal Legal <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Movement in common with Aboriginal Legal Aid services throughout Australia provided free legal assistance to all Aboriginal applicants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For that reason, the assistance provided by the Aboriginal Legal <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Movement has been free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of inflation and increased legal costs, the Aboriginal Legal <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Movement has been effectively granted less money since 1976-77. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The residents of Aurukun and Mornington Island have security of tenure for their land and have been granted their traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span> in a way which no other Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community in Queensland has achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What has happened,  Mr Speaker,  is that the Commonwealth selfmanagement legislation has been a catalyst for the advance of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the Aboriginal and Islander people of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Local Government (Aboriginal Lands) Act 1978 might very well be regarded as the flag flying at the masthead of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have said, those two communities, as a result of Commonwealth action, now enjoy <span class="highlight">rights</span> which other Aboriginals and Islanders in Queensland do not enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these <span class="highlight">rights</span> can be vetoed by a white manager who has nothing in common with the Aboriginal people, who is not chosen or employed by them, and cannot be sacked by them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only is there a lack of self-determination in the matter of where Aboriginals are entitled to live or with whom they can communicate, but also there are many other human <span class="highlight">rights</span> denied Aboriginals in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The administration of these provisions has not been fully effective because they do not provide an adequate legal framework, nor do they contain protection of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of staff against arbitrary action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These procedures and principles together with the appeal provisions to which I will refer shortly will offer the protection to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual officers which does not exist under the Public Service Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not under threat and the laws of Norfolk Island, I hope, will continue to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those people who live there to enjoy their culture and to ensure that they can contain the number of people who go there to share the island with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since 1962, when the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 was amended to make enrolment for Aboriginal people a matter of choice, the Australian Electoral Office has conducted ad hoc visits to Aboriginal communities in order to acquaint them with their electoral <span class="highlight">rights</span> and responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790501_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-1-63">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That statement to me, when weighing up the problems and difficulties associated with trespassing, as it were, on civil liberties and private <span class="highlight">rights</span>, seems to be a sufficient safeguard to ensure that Australia has the best of both worlds in maintaining the freedom of people and capturing those who are engaged in drug trafficking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the Minister for Post and Telecommunications: Did the Australian Broadcasting Commission lose its exclusing <span class="highlight">rights</span> to televise test cricket simply because this Government slashed the ABC’s budget and left it without the capacity to submit a competitive tender? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The first point I make is that since it took over the functions of the old Arbitration Inspectorate, the Industrial Relations Bureau, as part of its normal day-to-day ongoing functions, has been carrying out thousands of inspections of a routine kind, and has been giving advice to companies, individual employers, unions and unionists on their <span class="highlight">rights</span> in relation to industrial legislation, the observance of organisations ‘ rules and things of that kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition agrees that that is so, but it will not co-operate to the extent that the House plays a secondary role, nor will it co-operate to the extent of asking its members to deny themselves their right to call divisions, or to call for a quorum if they feel that is necessary, or to deny themselves any other <span class="highlight">rights</span> which they have as members of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I find myself in the situation where I feel my <span class="highlight">rights</span> are being abused- I know other members of the Opposition feel the same way- it is my intention - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having recognised their <span class="highlight">rights</span> on the one hand and their particular relationship with the land on the other hand, the Government said to them: ‘Although you, as communities, are reluctant to have mining companies cutting a swath across your land and plundering it for whatever mineral wealth is there, whether or not you like it the only thing that is open to you to negotiate is how much compensation you will get. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the adoption of them in terms of Aboriginal communities- most of which are struggling and deprived communities- is another example of a swindle being performed on Aboriginal communities by a government which, while talking about Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> and sensitivity in understanding their problems, is prepared in the final analysis to give with one hand and to take away with the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The principles of the Fox report were sold out by the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation, which was emasculated in 1976 by the change of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who sold them out, the people who leaned on them, are the people who sit on the opposite side of the House and talk great pious hypocrisy about land <span class="highlight">rights</span>, human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and Aboriginal culture and then torpedo it whenever there is a mineral, pastoral, State government or Northern Territory government interest which says: ‘We cannot afford those blacks; we want the minerals at any price’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But over the last 20 years there has been a great advance in the attitude of the Australian people towards the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That realisation could not be sheeted home to any government in particular, but over the last three years or so there has been a constant chiselling of the progress of the Aboriginal people and of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> that have been established for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I just remind honourable members of four issues involving the lands and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During that period the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation was established! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its purpose was to give permanent <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the Aborigines and to establish absolute, unqualified obligations on the part of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Diamonds have been discovered in the north-west part of the Kimberley Ranges, and so there has been a move to unsettle and to take away the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Oombulgurri people in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should think that all the royalties and all the money which have been paid to the 30,000 to 40,000 Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory would not amount to what  Mr Lang  Hancock, for instance, has made out of his <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is, if the Republic of Korea withdrew from the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty and from the safeguards regime, and if it further declined to accept the full scope safeguards required, Australia would have the capacity to exercise its safeguards or retrieval <span class="highlight">rights</span> only in respect of, say, 40 per cent of the nuclear material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A further amendment moved by the Government in the Senateinsertion of clause 40- will require the Organization to furnish assessments intended or likely to be used by a State for prescribed administrative action only through a Commonwealth department or authority, thus ensuring that the person concerned has the benefit of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> as to notification and appeal provided in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They therefore represent one of the most important steps taken in this Parliament for many years directed to the protection of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The legislation that I am today introducing represents a balance between the needs of the nation for a strong, reliable and highly efficient security service and the need to preserve our individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will equip ASIO with the powers essential for those tasks and at the same time provide safeguards for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals and the continuation of our democratic institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As salvage <span class="highlight">rights</span> or liabilities under the Navigation Act acquired before a wreck is declared historic are to be preserved, the Bill also makes express provision for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another topic that the Prime Minister has raised from time to time as an issue of some compassionate concern to him is that of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in countries within our region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recognise the limitations on a country such as Australia seeking to lecture developing countries on the issue of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bill incorporates significant amendments to the earlier Bill in the area of appeal <span class="highlight">rights</span> following discussions with staff organisations, as I have outlined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many cases, there would be direct termination of employment and there would be no <span class="highlight">rights</span> of appeal or guarantees of compensation which are provided for under this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before retirement can take place, alternative employment opportunities must be thoroughly explored and all staff have <span class="highlight">rights</span> of appeal to an independent tribunal against decisions taken under the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It modifies the other provisions which have been described in the past as being of too summary a nature by providing a more extensive range of appeal <span class="highlight">rights</span> available to staff affected and by setting out more clearly the framework within which decisions are taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those officers who might be affected by these provisions have very extensive <span class="highlight">rights</span> of appeal and in many cases they will obtain extensive additional benefits which are not available to other officers retiring voluntarily or to people in private industry whose employment is terminated for various reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this Bill the employee also has <span class="highlight">rights</span> of appeal to an independent tribunal against decisions taken under the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are providing the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of appeal that are not there now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we speak about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of employees to appeal, we are talking about individual employees only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If so, will this belated recognition of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> be eroded by (a) persistence of slow worker permit laws and (b) imposition on wage-earners of new levies for rates, rentals, etc., on reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-57-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They sounded more like the words we have become used to hearing from the pro-communist left wing which has now most assuredly taken control of the Australian Labor Party in this country- the same sort of people who are in charge of the Victorian branch, which last year at its conference refused, and I repeat ‘refused’, to stand up and condemn the systematic and brutal violations of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people were not even prepared to utter one word of criticism in respect of those continuing violations of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government states that the consultation that will go on between the parties involved will preserve the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individuals or class of employees of a department who may be involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members say ‘All the appeals are there; all the preservations of <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the public servants are there’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that some sections of this Bill go some way towards achieving that end, but we are not prepared to accept the arguments that have been put forward by other speakers or by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs  (Mr Viner)  that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the public servants are preserved when the Government introduces a provision into the Bill such as clause 7(b) (iii). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government decides to opt out of certain services now available to the public we believe that the method should be laid out and compelled in this Bill so that everybody, especially the people affected, would know of the decision, the reasons for it, how they would be affected and what their <span class="highlight">rights</span> of appeal would be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was a member of that Royal Commission and he made this contribution in his own name under the heading ‘<span class="highlight">Rights</span>, Obligations, Grievances and Remedies of and against staff’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>(6) to clause 9 whereby the Opposition seeks to require that a redeployment declaration should include certain details of the declaration made and the reasons for it, the date from which the redeployment declaration is to be effective, and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of and methods for appeal against the declaration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among these matters will be the information to be given to an employee at the same time as a copy of a redeployment declaration, including the information to which I have referred, namely, details of the declaration itself, the reasons for it, the date of it and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and methods of appeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me make it quite clear that it is intended that the regulations issued under the legislation will require that when employees are joined to an appeal they be advised and be given the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> to make submissions as the appellant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, they will be in an equal status before the tribunal so that they can protect their own <span class="highlight">rights</span> before the tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know this is a point that is sought to be whipped up outside this chamber, but I make quite clear the way in which the regulations will protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals who have not had a declaration made with respect to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But an individual, declared surplus as a result of the outcome of the appeal by another employee, retains the further separate <span class="highlight">rights</span> of appeal against any redeployment action taken or a decision that redeployment is not practicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure honourable members will readily appreciate that, by the procedures I have described and through the <span class="highlight">rights</span> which each individual affected by a declaration has, he will be fully protected in respect of his own personal position within the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition members are not relieved at all in their expectations of the way in which this Bill will be implemented by the Minister telling us that the person who is roped in at the appeal is going to have the same <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> that person is going to have is the right to rope in a few more people, and so it goes on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me remind the honourable member for Port Adelaide of what  Mr Munro  said in his appendix to the report of the royal commission when dealing with the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, obligations, grievances and remedies of and against staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would add one more thing concerning this aspect of the Bill because the honourable member for Melbourne has drawn in a number of other arguments in support of his attack upon the appeal <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this legislation provides is a more extensive range of appeal <span class="highlight">rights</span> to staff affected by redeployment or retirement and, furthermore, sets out more clearly the framework within which decisions are to be taken by the Public Service Board or a permanent head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that comment, in itself, is a measure of the completeness and the adequacy of the provisions of this Bill and in particular, the completeness and adequacy of the appeal <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this legislation but which are absent in the existing provisions of the Public Service Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides more satisfactory and extensive safeguards and appeal <span class="highlight">rights</span> for such staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What <span class="highlight">rights</span> have they to be any more secure than, perhaps, people in private industry or the self-employed person, the small business man or the small farmer? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a massive abrogation of the basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly in relation to the Coombs Royal Commission findings concerning grievances, <span class="highlight">rights</span> and duties, it would be our intention to explore the implications of these in association with the Public Service unions and other affected groups, bodies and people to bring about genuine reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would seek to establish a statutory framework concerning the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of staff and to have that incorporated within the Public Service Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That framework would affect things such as a clearer definition of processes for determining services for which the staff are engaged, tenure or conditions of employment, issues reflecting appeal processes, the establishment of equal opportunity and, of course, the enshrining of civil and political <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It takes away <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of the Committee stage of the debate we will take the opportunity to move amendments designed to improve the provisions of the Bill and certainly to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members of the Australian Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first of those additional benefits is a cash payment on severence in those circumstances set out under the Bill in addition to- and I emphasise ‘in addition to’- the public servants’ <span class="highlight">rights</span> under the Superannuation Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The vast majority of the ordinary workers in Australia have none of those <span class="highlight">rights</span> whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thank the honourable member for Holt  (Mr Yates)  for making the point that he, like all members on the Government side of the House, can tell public servants that the Opposition would deny them the very real <span class="highlight">rights</span> that will be provided to them under the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill by way of voluntary retirement and the real protection which this Bill will give to them in contrast to the existing provisions of the Public Service Act in a case of redundancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Offset credit is also allowed for the value of transferred technology, the waiver of licence fees, manufacturing <span class="highlight">rights</span> and royalty payments and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That this House expresses its grave concern and regret that Queensland is approaching the status of a one party state, that members of the Parliament have been denied basic democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> in accordance with Westminster principles of parliamentary democracy and that Queensland Opposition members have been denied balanced facilities, resources and speaking time, and accordingly the House should initiate action designed to established a Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> describing and protecting basic political and human <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all Australians - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because development <span class="highlight">rights</span> ensue from government action, it is the community generally and not individual land holders who should reap the benefits accruing from such <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>in growth centres or land held by Land Commissions or urban Land Councils, residential land be freehold subject to improvement conditions and reservation’ of development <span class="highlight">rights</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as secretly crusading for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the oil companies to drill the reef, the Federal Government has been concocting another scheme by which it will give the reef to the Queensland Government which will allow drilling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly, he seemed to say that the Government should rush ahead, declare the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and totally ignore the complex constitutional issues involved and any <span class="highlight">rights</span> and interests that the Queensland Government might have in the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By handing over to the Queensland Government the three-mile offshore territorial waters, as the Prime Minister will do within the next three months, he is virtually handing the Gulf Oil Company the mining <span class="highlight">rights</span> to the Great Barrier Reef on a gold platter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite erratic and inadequate notification of <span class="highlight">rights</span> to claimants, coupled with an appeals body that lacks independence and may have its decisions reversed by the Director-General of Social Security, more than 50 per cent of those unemployment beneficiaries who appeal against termination of benefit are found to have been unjustly penalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These provisions were based on a precedent contained in section 42 of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act  1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the House in talking about conciliation and arbitration that the trade unions have <span class="highlight">rights</span> and duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly it was an interesting case and it does have implications for both employers and employees and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition would know, the Bureau’s work is primarily concerned with protecting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals and protecting the status and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of organisations where such <span class="highlight">rights</span> and status are infringed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have referred already to the protection of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the Labor Government’s term of office, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals were ignored and economic stability crumbled to meet the demands of the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless the legislation is changed, it will leave only unions open to prosecution under the sections of the legislation allegedly aimed at protecting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals against actions by unions and employers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was based on our argument that his original Customs Amendment Bill 1979 gave too much to the necessities of law enforcement and lacked consideration for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Traditionally, on questions of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual and the due process of law, we have been absolutely emphatic that we would not permit encroachment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that some of these proposals will be recognised for what they are- expressions of concern for the preservation of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not one who goes overboard in that particular area but when we start to transgress on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals to their privacy our steps must be considered most carefully and most properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But some honourable members should be allowed to stand up as friends of the protectists of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual in relation to privacy, and I place myself in that category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals are subject to the danger that the information gathered by departments could be abused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I believe that it should be an offence for Customs officers to disclose information gathered by them except where Parliament gives them authority to disclose it and it should be made a criminal offence for which they can be charged in order that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual citizens cannot be abused by the wrong use of the information that is properly collected for the purposes of the administration of the Customs and narcotics laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that an increasing number of people in this chamber are turning their attention in this changing age to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals is at least rewarding for some of those who have been long time champions of the cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In previous years, the following items were also exempted from taxation: 20 per cent of profits from certain prescribed minerals; dividends paid out of profits from sales of petroleum; and income from sale of mining <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that that is critically important to a parliament that believes that one of its fundamental missions is to look after the cause and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual and to treat them as the supreme ideal of parliamentary government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are even more important in terms of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because of the need to maintain the privacy of those sorts of relationships that the rule of law has operated traditionally in our system to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe there is any situation in Australian society which justifies this Parliament abrogating people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> because we are concerned about a handfull of drug traffickers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what we are doing is adopting legislation that strikes at the basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of every Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basically, what we are talking about is something which goes to the basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of every Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that that provision will cut away the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of thousands of citizens in States in Australia which are not prepared to use bugging devices as a means of investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that on the subject of safeguarding people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span> to a fair trial or to the administration of the law, there should be freedom of information in a matter as important as the use of listening devices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have taken great care to try to prevent both the dangers suggested by the Minister and the threats to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of fair trial, without in any way endangering Customs agents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if this provision is left in, I believe a provision is being placed in the statute books which is alien to our law, alien to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of every Australian, and places at risk the property of people who might very well be innocent but who cannot prove it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If not, I hope that members of goodwill on both sides of the House will accept that this provision as it is drawn is too strong, is alien to our customs, is contrary to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australia, and ought to be rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the current position is that the appeal <span class="highlight">rights</span> in respect to existing members of the Commonwealth Police Force and the Australian Capital Territory Police Force are laid down in regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 16 May 1975 the Law Reform Commission reported on the question of the appropriate legislative means of safeguarding individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties in relation to the law enforcement process of the Australia Police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties ought to be safeguarded, but such a provision is not contained in the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I make this plea to the Minister: If the Government wants an efficient and effective police force it should ensure that the provisions for the welfare of the members in respect of promotions, appeals and transfers, whether they are written into the Act or made by way of regulations, safeguard the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in 1689 and the Act of Settlement in 1701 embodied in legal terms the settlement of constitutional government between Parliament and the Executive following the 1688 Revolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that Parliament over the next decade will need increasingly to ensure that, in the ultimate, it is Parliament that protects the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals and the very democracy which brings us as elected representatives of the people to this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the 1974 Second Report of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission,  Mr Justice  Woodward commented that ‘this is obviously a very drastic penalty and it is not surprising that it has never been invoked’ (paragraph 218). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790821_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-117-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But my hunch, based on discussion with members of the ethnic communities and so on, is that six weeks is not an adequate time for migrants to become skilled enough in the English language for the purposes for which the Government wants to give them training, namely, to ensure they can better fit into jobs and that they can find their way around and have better access to their <span class="highlight">rights</span> as members of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Once that becomes the practice- it appears that this Government has decided that it will be the practice- then the House itself loses control of its opportunities to fix the Standing Orders which not only protect the Government’s right to govern and to have its business conducted but also affect the Parliament’s right and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members of the Parliament, including the members of the Government who passively have agreed to this change in procedure over the last few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government is the first Government since I have been a member of this House and, I think, the first Government in the history of this Parliament, which has sought to impose Standing Orders on this House which have been predetermined, without taking into account the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual members of the House to consider and make private decisions on those Standing Orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this regard, I quote from Section 6 (Assignment of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>), of the original tender document C3/79/10, contained in Appendix B (Terms and Conditions to be observed by Concessionaires) which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The concessionaire shall not assign or sell any privileges or <span class="highlight">rights</span> arising under this authority or sub-let any part or parts of the business, except that he may appoint persons as his agents on franchise for the purpose of conducting the business at any of the airports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no procedure to allow the Minister to move a motion to do something with a petition- particularly something that would affect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of any member of this House- unless the House agreed by unanimous decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That right is guaranteed in Article 9 of the Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> 1688, which declares that the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not be impeached or questioned in any court of place out of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I pay tribute to him for his work in restoring the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of tuberculosis pensioners and bringing in many other improvements in benefits for veterans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known that, by the 9th Article of the Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, it was declared: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the House belong to each member and should not be transgressed by a government or by anybody getting the numbers and saying: ‘I am going to make certain that what you said in the House is going to be the subject of crossexamination in a court’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill of <span class="highlight">Rights</span> gives certain freedom of expression in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a member transgresses the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals, we, as a parliament, can deal with that member and can expel him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to inhibit us on the basis that perhaps we are not allowed to say something, because if we do we can be the subject of legal action which will be the subject of cross-examination, I think, is an inhibition of our <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not want to alter it now, but I want to say that if and when it goes to the Privileges Committee, members of the Committee ought to look at the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of each and every one of us in this chamber on the basis that those <span class="highlight">rights</span> are in no way interfered with unless the House unanimously agrees that such action can take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But by way of the ill-informed land <span class="highlight">rights</span> Act the development has been frustrated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Up to that time the claims and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of immigrants were largely ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were based upon needs that had arisen by virtue of the fact that for the first time in over 20 years when the Labor Party came to power immigrants recognised or began to recognise that they had <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and they began to ask for those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again one would have thought that because we are acknowledging the greater need for language training and because more and more people are learning of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this area, there would be an increase in the allocation for language teaching materials, but no. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that migrants often do not know their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and they will not come forward, so these people have to seek them out-  to encourage them to use the health resources available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> as every other Australian but this Government is still continuing to ignore their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said many times, and quoted examples, when mining projects have impinged on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span>, that the Government seems to give first priority to appeasing and co-operating with the States and to getting the consensus of the States even with a State like Queensland where the relevant Ministers are, frankly, totalitarian in these matters and have no intention of putting Aboriginal <span class="highlight">rights</span> ahead of their philosophies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the start of the liberating influence was at the end of the seventeenth century when John Locke proclaimed the right of the individual to his person and to his property and proclaimed the role of government to be limited to protecting those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This inevitably raises the question of whether the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual are in jeopardy if a government takes steps to discourage a course of conduct which is now pursued by a minority in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These might include health warnings on packets, taxation manipulation, restrictions on smoking opportunities, encouragement of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the non-smoker, as well as measures such as are involved in political, publicity and education programmes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is pleasing to me, as it is obviously pleasing to other Government members that we have also decided to restore through the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of tuberculosis pensioners and to bring about many other improvements in benefits for our war veterans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sir Reginald  Ansett ‘s Avis rent-a-car company, which previously had sole <span class="highlight">rights</span> as national operator, missed out when outbid by its two competitors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, Budget and Hertz paid their high prices on the clear understanding that the terms and conditions of the tenders protected their exclusive national <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suddenly, Avis appears likely to gain a national operation at a much lower cost, without having to service less profitable, or marginal, airports as its competitors, Budget and Hertz, are forced to do by the very terms and conditions they thought protected their exclusive national <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The original tender document C3/79/10 contained in appendix B ‘Terms and Conditions to be observed by Concessionaires’, section 6 ‘Assignment of <span class="highlight">Rights</span>’ stated as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would expect that in view of the enormous controversy that had raged around car rental <span class="highlight">rights</span> at airports, the details of the tender documents would have been meticulously examined and mulled over to ensure that there was no confusion in anybody’s mind as to what were the conditions of tender. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Operator shall not without the approval of the Secretary assign or sell any privileges or <span class="highlight">rights</span> arising under this authority or sub-let any pan or parts of the business, except that he may appoint persons as his agent or franchise for the purpose of conducting the business at any of the airports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Tenderers exercised their commercial judgment in the full knowledge of these facts and, in the event, placed vastly different values on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Great play has been made on the difference in wording between the paragraph in the original tender schedule relating to transferability of <span class="highlight">rights</span> and in the authorities issued to Budget and Hertz. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under a Labor Government, unions would be positively encouraged to trample over the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual workers with a genuine conscientious objection to union membership or to engaging in industrial action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one looks through the 13 ‘A pages of this statement on industrial relations, it is incredible that one sees the accusation that the Labor Party is one-sided, that it speaks on behalf of the trade union movement or the wage and salary earners of this country, but it does not look after, protect or stand up for the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of employers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The political systems, social structures, cultures and attitudes towards human <span class="highlight">rights</span> of our Third World neighbours differ in important aspects from ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also provides thoughtful, informed and some very trenchant views on the policy options available to Australia on crucial matters: How we should adjust to the rapid economic growth now taking place to our north; how we should conduct our relations with the Association of South East Asian Nations; how far our interests coincide with general Western interests in relation to the Third World; what our posture should be in the United Nations and other international forums; what principles should inform our policies on such matters as aid, human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, immigration and refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A related shortcoming is the approach it takes to human <span class="highlight">rights</span> issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas the report in various places urges us not to be patronising and claims, in referring to human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, that we should not impose our democratic values on other countries, the fact is that it rather patronisingly suggests that we should not expect our neighbours to respect human dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This also raises the pious argument in the report that we should not allow human <span class="highlight">rights</span> to be a factor in our relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In response to that I have emphasised several aspects; but let me now ask: Is the Committee trying to say that there is no concern in the Philippines about human <span class="highlight">rights</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a regrettable pattern of capitalseeking, rapid return, minimal national constraints and minimum <span class="highlight">rights</span> for as few local employees as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When a charter which is designed to balance corporate responsibility and personal <span class="highlight">rights</span> is given to a security organisation the ultimate purpose of that charter is the defence of a country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For reasons of common sense, for reasons of what occurs elsewhere in Australian society, for reasons of what occurs with respect to other organisations in Australian society, and for reasons of no guarantees as to the nature of appointments, it ought to be quite clear to this House that there ought to be no judicial review but that <span class="highlight">rights</span> are to be determined within the valid aims of the security organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let it be said that this package of measures at least attempts to lay down a charter for ASIO and a definition of its functions, the extent of its powers and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens with respect to the Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These agencies have been used by at least one American President to deny American citizens their democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and in fact used by him to corrupt the electoral process which is surely at the heart of the democratic system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has to be kept secure is not simply a physical entity; the society which exists within Australia is one with standards and principles which secure <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms as well as obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That society is not to be safeguarded by a repudiation of those standards or those principles with the consequent erosion of <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I also hold the view that, because there have been events within our country and elsewhere, one should not simply abandon for all times the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of all individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Already this debate largely has been concerned with the degree to which the legislation balances the need for adequate security on the one hand with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the liberties of the Australian citizen on the other hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether we like it or not, the history of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, like that of other intelligence agencies in Western society, shows that it has often abused its role and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the ordinary Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that every member of this Parliament, on looking back at the record of ASIO, is aware of some circumstance in which the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the liberties of the ordinary Australian citizen have been abridged to some extent by these actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a gross and, in my view, unjustifiable erosion of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the average Australian citizen going about his business, being involved in the workings of his own political system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any security intelligence gathering organisation in the discharge of its statutory duties, in my view, has a prime duty and a prime obligation to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the liberties of the Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation is very critical to the proper operation of our security forces and, indeed, to the hard won <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the ordinary Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was concerned to hear him argue so illogically that the same sorts of standards and prescriptions that apply to a company or a trade union- which is a public organisation, a voluntary organisation, like a company, with rules laid down- ought to apply to a security service, in the face of the findings of  Mr Justice  White and  Mr Justice  Hope and in the face of all the body of accumulated evidence that the laws have been broken and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the ordinary citizen have been transgressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I say that this is an opportunity when one does not make the sorts of glib presumptions which in the past have eroded the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the ordinary Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This action is recorded in our history as the greatest invasion of security possible and a violation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that a balance between the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual persons and the preservation of the security of Australia as a nation is no simple or easy thing to achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Granted that there are problems, it is necessary for us to ensure that any techniques adopted do not infringe fundamental human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, common law has guaranteed the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual to such an extent that there has been no successful prosecution for sedition in England for over 100 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is right to continue the practice of tilting the balance in favour of offering greater protection to the security of the State, rather than in the direction of the safeguarding the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the Conference of Privy Councillors- the greatest legal authority- has said that it would favour protection for the security of the State rather than safeguarding the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This clause appears to me to guarantee the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of any person who may be aggrieved in relation to any assessment made of him under the ASIO legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The definition should be more restrictive and the legislation should contain checks and balances guaranteeing that the civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual are not infringed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to know the extent to which this kind of practice becomes the order of the day under a government that seems to treat so indifferently the civil liberties and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should ensure when we are looking at security matters that we do so knowing that we believe in the declaration of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>; that we want to protect the privacy of the individual and his right to conduct his own life in his own way, provided always that he works within the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unemployment, reduced living standards, increased pollution and the restriction of our hard-earned industrial <span class="highlight">rights</span> will continue to be eroded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are intimidatory threats to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people to defend their interests through assembly and industrial action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The emotionalism which has been associated with so much of the objection to constructive critics in the past in my view has been couched out of concern to protect our security agency from any sort of criticism rather than a genuine concern about establishing or maintaining the minimal level of secrecy consistent with the democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the community and, on the other hand, an appropriately effective functioning of a security service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people have no appeal <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and no <span class="highlight">rights</span> even to know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are, firstly, to what extent does this nation require the services of such an organisation and, secondly, to what extent do our responsibilities as a national government demand that we protect and secure the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the citizens of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those people who call themselves Australians and who in the majority are law-abiding citizens, there must be some form of security organisation even if the socalled <span class="highlight">rights</span>- the civil <span class="highlight">rights</span>- of those few subversive elements have to be denied them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If telephone tapping and intelligence gathering are to be regarded as denying civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> to those few, it must be remembered once again that in our society it is only the guilty who have to worry about being denied their liberties which normal and good living Australians will retain and enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, this new Austraiian population deserves protection and these people should have the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> and should be encouraged to express their aspirations as all Australians do without fear of recrimination from outside influences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to be able to protect their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and guarantee to secure them against previous allegiances, as we should for all Australians against the challenges of the few who would want to interfere with and disrupt our way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is an argument it is whether the legislation strikes a reasonable balance between the maintenance of national security and the protection of personal privacy and individual <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole thrust of the Opposition ‘s case is based on the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation means that those <span class="highlight">rights</span> can be seriously interfered with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not think that people are entitled to have their <span class="highlight">rights</span> interfered with unless there is a good and valid reason so to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this Bill there are all sorts of intrusions into people’s <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think that as fair minded small ‘1’ liberals, honourable members opposite would understand that people have <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My attitude to the Bill and my attitude to the law is that we want a security system that is well nigh perfect but, equally, we want to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals- their civil <span class="highlight">rights</span>, their right of freedom and their right to live their own lives provided they live within the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want some means to exist by which there can be an oversight of ASIO’s operations so as to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of those individuals and do it well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has no respect for the civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> of persons and no respect for the legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens in a democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts of the situation are that the Government has decided that no consideration of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual in this society will be given and that no alterations will be granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would appreciate the opportunity of considering the actual clauses of the Bill in circumstances where they are not placed in the position of having to dispute with their Government the clauses that they feel should be altered in the interests of civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people should stand above petty party politics, but in this House it is quite obvious tonight that honourable members opposite are not prepared to give even basic consideration to those <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am fearful of the infringements to the civil <span class="highlight">rights</span>, liberties and freedoms of the Australian people that have been upheld since federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australians, many of whom fought in these wars to overthrow fascist regimes and to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms of the individual, are now being placed in an insidious position of having to look at the prospect of a new form of fascism in their own backyards of clean, respected Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been inundated with people suggesting that their <span class="highlight">rights</span> are going to be infringed and all the evidence points strongly to that fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right honourable member for Lowe has said, and all of us who have been in government know, that mistakes are made on many occasions and they can affect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everybody in the country could improve on this legislation from the point of view of his <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words, in a legislative committee, each person other than the 13 to 19 shall have less <span class="highlight">rights</span> than they have in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government is concerned about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have already acted to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals in relation to industrial organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Registration under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act confers very significant <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges upon an organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the full bench makes a declaration the Governor-General may within 6 months direct the Registrar to cancel the organisation’s registration or make orders suspending the <span class="highlight">rights</span>, privileges or capacities of the organisation or giving directions as to the exercise of any of its <span class="highlight">rights</span>, privileges or capacities or for restricting the use of its funds or property to ensure observance of the order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They would be used only where these <span class="highlight">rights</span>, fundamental to any democracy, are threatened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any group acts in a way which puts these <span class="highlight">rights</span> at risk, then they cannot expect the community to continue granting them the privileges to which they would otherwise be entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposal in clause 9 enabling beneficiaries under the Act to decide whether to insure their homes with the Corporation or with another insurer is, of course, subject to the Corporation retaining the normal <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a mortgagee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under this legislation these <span class="highlight">rights</span> can be infringed on the basis that people at some stage in the future might be likely to commit violent action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It could affect church groups, civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> groups, protest groups, minority political groups and, in fact, any opposition party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I basically believe that we in this country have a democracy which is robust enough to enable us to accept precision written into laws which concern security and intelligence and which protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of every Australian person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what the Opposition in this place is about; we are here to protect civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> and to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of every Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It should not be hard to compose a form of words that guarantees those civil <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been used in a way which has been directed at picking up people who are on about social reform, people who are concerned about class distinction in this society, about inequalities and the deprivation of <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Back in the old days of the 1 890s trade unions had to be formed to get some <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the workers and back in the Industrial Revolution in the early 1 820s something had to be done to get children out of the mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at the background of ASIO, no member of Parliament can say that in the past it has not abused its prerogatives and has not- in many cases wrongly, on a number of occasions illegally- jeopardised the fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> of many thousands of Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no compelling reason for parliamentarians having to balance the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the ordinary Australian citizen and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a security intelligence organisation or to make any presumption in favour of that organisation as against the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the first duty of any government instrumentality or any government police force is to preserve and enhance the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legislation which by its very definition tends to reduce the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of the Australian people is bad legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I think we have to protect the country and I think we have to protect the country against people who believe that an individual ‘s <span class="highlight">rights</span> should be subject to the political nees or thoughts of a person such as the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How many people have been disadvantaged in Australia- denied Australian citizenship, denied positions in the Public Service and denied normal civilian <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Australiabecause of the existence of a security file? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that this House is involved in a practice of denying protection to citizens and acquiring for instrumentalities of the Government of the day means by which the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals can be denied rather than protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The dilemma of this clause is that it imposes a responsibility on the Director-General which means that he does have seriously to consider whether he is going to waste the time and funds of his organisation by placing officers of security in buildings in Brisbane to take photographs of people who are exercising their democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that we should be involving the Director-General of Security in situations where we give him a definition that is so broad, so wide that he finishes up having to involve himself and having to involve his service in what has been described as spook activities which are directed towards the legitimate <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the ligitimate expression of view and the legitimate exercise of the civil liberties of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do so because people listening to this debate might think that neither this Government,  Mr Justice  Hope, nor ASIO itself, has any regard for the individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms of Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government knows, as did  Mr Chifley  and the Menzies Government before us, that in this area there is a delicate balance between those individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms and the security of our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had in mind throughout my inquiries that a balance between the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual persons and the preservation of the security of Australia as a nation is no simple or easy thing to achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can do what they like’, it means immediately that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the private citizen are annihilated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, once the dragnet has been cast so wide that it encompasses unlawful and lawful activities and the Government says ‘They are to be regarded as part of the process of surveillance’, that is the first step towards some kind of police state where the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the citizen are qualified and where the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the security organisation are unlimited; where the Parliament keeps putting restraints on itself and keeps giving carte blanche to somebody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What sort of a democratic parliamentary institution are we if we really are abdicating our <span class="highlight">rights</span> and saying to somebody else: ‘You take them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had brought to my notice in my time things which I regarded as very dangerous to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals and their future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is totally dissatisfied about the protection of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals under this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the difference between the honourable member for Dundas  (Mr Ruddock),  the Government and the Opposition on this matter really comes back to an approach to the responsibilities- as supporters of the government see them- and the role of the security forces and our approach in balancing that role with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one of the functions of our intelligence and security forces to protect and enhance the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difference between the honourable member for Dundas, the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs  (Mr Viner)  and members of the Opposition is simply this: We say that when it comes to balancing those two issues the presumption always has to be and should be on defending the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the citizen, not on imposing additional and complex responsibilities on the Director-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its attitude towards the Parliament is that because it is a defence matter none of us have any <span class="highlight">rights</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat what I said earlier in the day: The establishment of a security file on a person places a very serious limitation on that person’s civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ability to establish a security file on a matter which is deemed to be subversive but which is not illegal would seem to be an extension of the inroads into the legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens which should not be tolerated in a democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He certainly has no respect for the law as a protector of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a citizen but he looks on it as a vehicle to inhibit the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said at the beginning, this clause is bad enough, but when I hear these sorts of arguments, I am terrified that anyone ought to have these sorts of powers because what we are dealing with are the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of the ordinary Australian citizen and what this clause is dealing with is the crime of subversion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from certain direct financial benefits, such as access fees, which will flow to the community from the AFZ, the Government anticipates that other benefits will flow, for example, to the Australian fishing industry as it increases its share of the total allowable catch; to the fish processing industry, which may handle a portion of the foreign catch as well as the expected increase in domestic production; and to traders and local authorities in ports to which licensed foreign boats are granted entry <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The implication was that if they did not sign they could lose the Northern Land Council, the Land Council could lose some of its <span class="highlight">rights</span>, the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act might be amended, or the Government might appoint an arbitrator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In any case, any of those outcomes was more likely than the appointment of an independent arbitrator to determine Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the event of the Aboriginal people not toeing the line and not signing the agreement which the Government felt they should sign within the time specified by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to use the opportunity presented by clause 17 to point out the deep concern of all members of the Opposition at the cavalier way in which the Government has chosen to treat this Parliament by gagging this legislation, legislation which affects the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of some two and a half million people, legislation which dramatically alters the basic fabric of the Act dealing with conciliation and arbitration and the settlement of industrial disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so, I condemn this Government for its blatant interference with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation affects the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of some two and a half million people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, one particularly disturbing aspect of the Timor situation is the persistant refusal of those countries that normally champion human <span class="highlight">rights</span> to examine, let alone accept, the steady flow of evidence that a tragedy of far greater proportions that was at first believed has been endured by the inhabitants of an island only 350 miles from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus no single nation has sought to bring any significant pressure to bear on Indonesia, the power largely responsible for what must be one of the most flagrant denials of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the history of modern decolonization. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it seems that the present level of relief, not to speak of the low level of interest in the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> situation, does not match the magnitude of the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent times abuses of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in relatively distant Uganda, Eritrea and the Central African Empire have been more extensively reported and responded to in the Australian press than reports at least as credible, that have come out of East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the most disturbing dimension of the Timor tragedy is that none of those countries who are in a position to exert some influence on Indonesia, has shown other than a sceptical and passive interest in reports of this disturbing contravention of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The case of East Timor presents, in relative terms, the most serious case of abuse of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, not to mention the right of self-determination, ever to have been inflicted ona people, in the crude guise of integration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a very bad Government in Western Australia when it comes to the question of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue for this national Parliament is to look at its responsibilities in respect of legislation to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If such legislation is allowed to persist in this country which means that people can be incarcerated or fined simply because they have expressed their democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> it will lead to a very fascist-like domination of the trade union movement and many other movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this particular case the people involved held a meeting to discuss the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of their fellow trade unionists, an action which the Conciliation and Arbitration Act well encourages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is wrong in law and it is important that the Australian people, the trade unionists and particularly the people of Western Australia know that the laws in Western Australia contradict the principles of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the principles upon which the laws of public assembly should be based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has already entered into an International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a covenant to which the Australian Government has subscribed, and Australia is a member of the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential that this be done not only because of present industrial matters in Western Australia but also because it would help in Queensland in regard to street marches, and it would help in Western Australia from the point of view of Aborigines having equal voting <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister should also state that, on the basis of ordinary democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span>, they are entitled to hold a meeting and should not be refused those <span class="highlight">rights</span> because somebody grabs hold of a law and says: Look, you have to get permission but we will not give you permission; so if there is a meeting, you will be arrested’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has come to light because there has been a connivance and collusion between the Premier and the Government of Western Australia and the Police Commissioner to deny Australians their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is totally contrary to the sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual States to deal with legislation in accordance with the procedures of their parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall now deal with the first point raised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition which was related to the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order … the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government certainly has an interest in trying to see that national strikes are brought to an end, but it should not do so by interfering in the sovereign <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individual States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition failed to mention further is that the Commonwealth has no power to legislate in respect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of public assembly in a State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last point I mention is the way in which the smokescreen has been thrown up to divert attention from the left wing and Labor-inspired activities of people who seek to abuse the democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of others in this country by false and fake assemblies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, in respect of my representations about the fallacy of what he said, the law in Western Australia does not give any <span class="highlight">rights</span> of appeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not misrepresent the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  on Article 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that a similar situation obtained last year when air navigation charges were increased and the two airlines agreed to waive their <span class="highlight">rights</span> under clause 8 of the 1961 agreement and to permit a15 per cent increase in ANCs for that year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to say that the two major airlines have again agreed to waive their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to permit the 25 per cent increase proposed by the Government this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments proposed do not, in any way, take away or reduce the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of existing invalidity pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the very basis of the principle of separate development and distinct <span class="highlight">rights</span> as between people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We desire to remain friendly with countries without surrendering basic <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, if a foreign policy attitude is adopted on account of a conception of basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> and there is evidence of attempts to alter those <span class="highlight">rights</span> there is a consequent obligation on a country to take those attempts into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill enables our security organisation to have powers that on any view of it greatly infringe upon and impede the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the liberties of the Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would not matter if I were a member of a Labor government and this Bill were our legislation, I would say that the security and the protection of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of the Australian people would be enhanced and safeguarded by the simple fact that the Leader of the Opposition whoever he may be- whether it is the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  or the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs  (Mr Viner)  who is sitting at the table, or anyone of a host of prominent members of the Liberal Party- would be kept fully informed as of right within the terminology of the amendment moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would safeguard the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of the Australian people against any temptation by the Attorney-General of the day to use the very considerable processes within this legislation for bipartisan purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We reluctantly believe that many of these powers are necessary for a security organisation, but in giving those powers to a security organisation we need to have a system of checks and balances to ensure that the prerogatives of this Parliament and through those prerogatives the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Australian people, are maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this amendment were to be accepted, many of the arguments that have already been put forward in respect of the legislation could be transfigured inasmuch as the people of Australia would know that, whatever changes of government or of personnel take place, the Leader of the Opposition as spokesman for the alternative government must as of right be kept fully informed of the exercise of those powers which strike most at the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of the average citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are going to interfere with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people who vote for members of the Opposition as well as voting for members of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I do not think that is the basis upon which to make judgments as to whether or not there should be an amendment to an Act of Parliament to give certain <span class="highlight">rights</span> to a person who, as an individual, will give certain undertakings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That quote was not dragged out of the air by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith  (Mr Lionel Bowen);  it was a statement made by the Attorney-General in the public media at a time when, it has to be presumed, he understood and had knowledge of the very considerable <span class="highlight">rights</span> and powers that he had under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are dealing with is interference with the basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the average Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is precisely because there is that difference of approach, that different perception of tasks, that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of Australian citizens would be made more secure if we adopted the phraseology and the standard set by the Attorney-General when he said that he was prepared to make as much detail as possible available to the Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Dundas, in order to take a schoolboy debating point, deliberately attempted to misconstrue what was said by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, This amendment will go a long way to securing the confidence of at least half the Australian community who at present are concerned about this legislation and want to see legislation which will mean not only that our security force can have the powers that it needs to act but also that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and hard won liberties of the people are maintained and are secure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I would say this: If those <span class="highlight">rights</span> were to be infringed, they would have to be on very strong grounds, so great that it was palpably a case where national security was involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is very silly and very trite if it believes that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, despite its antidemocratic track record, is going to be a better judge of national security and the people’s democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> than those who have been elected to serve the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if there is a conflict and the Attorney-General says to the Director-General: I believe that I am entitled to have this information in order to know how you conducted a particular aspect of your activities’, the DirectorGeneral is perfectly within his legal <span class="highlight">rights</span> to say I am very sorry, Attorney-General; I do not propose to tell you’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This very Government, this very AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Durack)-  these people who talk about our system- are creating an exception which could ultimately undermine in very serious ways the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do we say that the Director-General is a man of such unblemished character that his judgment ultimately ought to prevail as against the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Attorney-General on these very serious issues? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sorry that my erudite friend, the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs  (Mr Viner)  who one day might even be the Attorney-General, is prepared to vote for legislation which would limit his traditional <span class="highlight">rights</span>, his traditional prerogatives, rather than the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and prerogatives of the Director-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that is a very serious inroad into the whole concept of ministerial responsibility and therefore is a very serious derogation of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and powers of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is extraordinary that we ought to be debating a clause like this which is so fundamental to the whole legislation and which strikes at the basis of the question of authority and the system of democracy as it operates in this country, where a DirectorGeneral of an organisation whose record is not, to say the least, particularly good in terms of safeguarding the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual is, in terms of this clause, able to deny to the Parliament, and to the Minister, information which has been collected by the organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One gets the feeling that the Government is somewhat embarrassed by this legislation, that it is not prepared to come into the chamber and debate the legislation even to the extent that it was debated in the Senate where there may be, perhaps, stronger traditions of civil liberty and stronger Government members who are concerned about protecting the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that as long as the Government is prepared to allow a clause like this to stand within legislation like this, we cannot really believe that the cant about individual liberties, the cant about democracy and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of freedom of speech and the right to organise, is anything more than cant or anything more than hypocrisy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, at the same time, we have to get a balance in order to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been abuses in the past in respect of <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals unfortunately from people who occupy very senior positions in this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has recognised this special cultural identity of the Aboriginal people within the life and laws of Australian society in its Lands <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Legislation and its minerals development policies. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In extending jurisdiction over a 200-mile fishing zone Australia gets certain <span class="highlight">rights</span> but also has to assume certain obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 4 of the Bill continues the Government’s policy of expanding, wherever possible, the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to administrative decisions which affect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> or entitlements of persons under Commonwealth legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are many of us who are concerned about the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the liberties of the people of Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no single piece of legislation that deals with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and liberties of the Australian people that is as important as this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is on that basis again that we can give some safeguard to the people who elect all of us, to whom we are answerable and to whom we must guarantee that their <span class="highlight">rights</span> have not unnecessarily been infringed or invaded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The knowledge that there will be a judicial audit will act as a sanction and guarantee that those people will not violate any of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the citizens of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition wants to stengthen the standing and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the ordinary citizen vis-a-vis ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of what we know or what leaks out about ASIO suggests that ASIO in Australia really concentrates very much on easy targets -on targets on street marches, especially in Brisbane, Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> campaigners, pacifists, environmentalists, trade unionists and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, the issue of a warrant would be the last resort and it was necessary to go to that extreme length of interfering with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very important, in dealing with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people, to bear in mind that this Bill goes a long way in providing that a judge has to be satisfied on oral and other facts which are put before him before he issues a warrant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, they strengthen the Bill insofar as there is a guarantee to every citizen that there will be no unnecessary interference with their <span class="highlight">rights</span> of privacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps he has entertained the Parliament a little but really he has insulted the judiciary of Australia and has suggested that the judiciary does not know the first thing about human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, whereas I believe it is the fundamental protector of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs: In view of the imminent declaration of Australia ‘s 200-mile economic zone, is the Minister aware of United States law which declares tuna a free swimming fish and bans any country declaring a 200-mile zone from interfering with the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of United States fishing vessels to catch tuna in those areas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister also aware that the same law prescribes that any interruption to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a United States vessel under these circumstances will result in all possible sanctions being placed on the country concerned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit to the Committee that in taking this legislation to the stage at which it is now before the chamber, the Government is merely providing for a punishment for persons for being members of a trade union, of a protective association for their <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One needs to look at the amendments set out in clause 36 within the context of the whole range of measures that this Government has brought in to restrict the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms of people involved in industrial action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Victoria the general view taken is that prosecutions are launched for summary or relatively minor offences in an attempt to get a quick hearing and to have directors convicted so that they lose their <span class="highlight">rights</span> to be directors for some years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a sense, I think the attitudes which are present in this legislation, attitudes which are reflected in clauses 35, 41 and 42, are designed essentially to increase alienation within the Australian community, to increase division and bitterness, to make people feel that, if they do not match up to a test which most of the people in this Parliament have rarely matched up to, somehow they are less than equal and somehow they do not have the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> as the rest of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Implicit within them are concepts of social control, of coercion, of conflict within the community, where we repress people in a certain section of the community and deny them basic <span class="highlight">rights</span>, where we subject them to harassment, where we pursue them rather than seeking to understand how they can make a contribution to the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having regard to the above, it is realistic to say that contributors, who may or may not have voting <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the election of boards of management, can be regarded as the owners’ of the registered benefits organisations, to the extent of their benefit entitlements under the rules of the particular organisation and the fact that under the provisions of the National Health Act dealing with the winding up of a medical and/or hospital fund, the Federal Court is required to make such order as it considers to be most advantageous for the’ interests of the contributors ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the world-wide protests against this mockery of justice perpetrated in Prague and in view of the public statements of  President  Carter,  Mrs Thatcher,  the Italian  President  and the European Parliament, will the Minister now indicate Australia’s attitude to this travesty of basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It follows the last answer which he gave during this Question Time when he gave a noble and impartial display of concern about abuse of civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> in Czechoslovakia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, would he extend that noble and impartial declaration to other areas, such as areas within our own region, and condemn the quite nasty abuses of civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> which have been documented in a number of reports such as those from Amnesty International and the International Commission of Jurists in relation to countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, as well as many other countries which are in our region but are a little further away? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that it was this Government that sought and obtained election to the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission, and that those who sit opposite who proclaimed their interest in these matters at no time when in government sought or obtained election to that body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The term ‘disarmament’ is most usefully seen as shorthand for ‘disarmament and arms control’, and covering a wide range of activities which could be put under these six headings: Firstly, the negotiations between the superpowers to control nuclear armaments and otherwise limit or control the development of the strategic environment or particular weapon systems; secondly, the discussions in international organisations, particularly at the United Nations, among wider groups of countries to seek the elimination, or ban the use of, particular categories of weapons; thirdly, the diplomatic conferences sponsored by the International Committee of the Red Cross to improve international law relating to humanitarian <span class="highlight">rights</span> in armed conflict; fourthly, the various activities underway to prevent the diversion of nuclear material to military or explosive use; fifthly, regional negotiations to secure limitations to or a reduction of force levels, or to establish procedures for war avoidance; and finally, unilateral actions by countries to shape their defence forces and their diplomatic posture to diminish the prospects of conflict and enable reallocation of national resources in their region to social purposes rather than military expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s explicit policy towards human <span class="highlight">rights</span> issues as set out in his annual foreign policy statement on 9 May 1978 is that these issues should be discussed in the United Nations and not elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again, today in Question Time, the Minister was anxious to say that Australia was on the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Opposition does not want to see the Minister embarrassed at the United Nations, but if people start to agitate in this country- as they are- against the deprival of their human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, he is going to be so embarrassed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me to be imperative, considering the makeup of our economy, that when we are dealing with manpower programs and trying to monitor the work force we involve the largest of the pressure groups exercising their <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the years that I have been here the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges of the rank and file members of this Parliament have been eroded bit by bit, and greater power has gone to the Executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I say in passing that it is extraordinary for members such as the honourable member for Reid to pretend that less time has been given this year to the consideration of Estimates than was given in the past, and that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of members have been eroded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has he considered the publication and distribution of a Disarmament Kit similar to the Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Kit which the Government is publishing for use by educational institutions and community groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-66-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>President  Park ‘s Government faced enormous problems in managing the country’s economic development and meeting this continuing external threat, and there were criticisms of his Government’s observance of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also undisputed, however, that material success alone does not guarantee community satisfaction and the deficiencies of the previous Government of the Republic of Korea in representing what we would generally regard as basic democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> have been the cause of a great deal of dissatisfaction in the Republic of Korea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recording our sadness at the manner of the late President’s death we also feel a need to observe that perhaps the new government might find it timely to initiate a program aimed at establishing broadly and comprehensively the democratic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people ofKorea including the basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the members of its National Assembly under a new constitution to reinforce the impressive material gains which have been made in its economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister confirm that this is the result of the sale of exclusive television <span class="highlight">rights</span> by the organisers, the Victoria Racing Club, to a commercial television operator who can provide only a limited coverage? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Yarrabah is an example of some of the other problems in Queensland- and I believe it is- it is timely, appropriate and urgent that the Commonwealth Government assert its constitutional <span class="highlight">rights</span> and take over the administration of the care and advancement of Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal people in Queensland are quite clear as to their <span class="highlight">rights</span>, namely, that they should have control of their own destiny and that they should have control of the land on which they are located. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that all special legislative and administrative measures affecting Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders should be based on respect for individual dignity and human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and should be designed to develop selfrespect, independence, self-management and self-sufficiency of Aboriginals and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, the Council requested that the Minister- and I emphasise this point- try to negotiate with the Queensland Government on behalf of the Yarrabah Council a form of land tenure for Yarrabah Community Council similar to that legislated for Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory with the addition of timber <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  has noted from a statement that I made to the House some time ago that the Commonwealth is committed, as it has been committed in the past, to obtaining for Aboriginal communities in Australia the right of selfmanagement, and with it a form of land tenure which in particular would secure for them their traditional, <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the usage of their traditional lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it is well known that by an Act of this Parliament land <span class="highlight">rights</span> by means of a particular form of land tenure were granted to Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory over which at that time the Commonwealth had exclusive constitutional control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known to this House that both self-management and land tenure were achieved by the Commonwealth for the Aboriginal people of Aurukun and Mornington Island under an Act of the Queensland Parliament, but one which specifically entrenched the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the Aboriginal people in those two communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think a government which in the future sought to take away from those two communities the entrenched <span class="highlight">rights</span> which they have achieved under that legislation would be a government which threw fear and caution to the wind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I can inform the House and I can positively inform members of the Yarrabah Council, through this House, that the twin <span class="highlight">rights</span> which my colleague is seeking to negotiate on their behalf, as requested by them in January, are to obtain self-management of their community and their reserve lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a very grave infraction of basic civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> as the law stands at the moment and it is a much more grave infraction of the legal authority of the Narcotics Bureau to function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But until it was provided there could be no justification at all for such illegal incursions taking place- incursions which took place in circumstances about which we know nothing and which may have been a very serious infringement of the basic <span class="highlight">rights</span> of perfectly honest people going about legitimate activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not endorsing one-armed bandits for Queensland; I am simply trying to point out that the <span class="highlight">rights</span> that people have depend on which side of that non-existent invisible line they happen to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But in any objective sense or analysis at all the levels of government the States have the least claim to any so-called <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Queensland Government’s record in acknowledging local government <span class="highlight">rights</span> and a certain amount of local government autonomy would be, without a doubt, the worst in Australia’s history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the new South Australian Government has now withdrawn the Bill, with a view to introducing a new Bill with considerably reduced <span class="highlight">rights</span> for the Aboriginal people, especially in respect of mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-47-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, it does not necessarily follow that it is also in the national interest to favour inventive, technology-exporting countries by extending monopoly <span class="highlight">rights</span> to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee believes that the civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Soviet citizens have improved considerably since the Stalin period ended in 1953. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the Soviet Union has failed to enter into the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, and has failed to implement many of its formal commitments in such documents as the International Covenant on Civil and Political <span class="highlight">Rights</span> and the Final Act of the 1975 Helsinki Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within three years of  Mr Brezhnev  signing the Final Act of the Helsinki Agreement, the Soviet Union flouted the Agreement’s human <span class="highlight">rights</span> provisions to such an extent that it has even imprisoned or expelled most of the people who, with considerable courage, had openly monitored the extent of Soviet compliance with the Helsinki Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms of Soviet citizens are very much subordinate to the interests of the Soviet State; this is made clear in the Soviet Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular, Soviet penal regulations, and even more so their implementation, fall far short of humane concepts- in the system of punishments, the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of prisoners to make complaints, to communicate with their families and friends, and, most seriously, to receive adequate nourishment and medical care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the evidence before the Sub-Committee on Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in the Soviet Union was to a great extent unfavourable to the Soviet Government, the Committee regrets that the Soviet Embassy in Australia did not avail itself of ample formal or informal opportunities to put a Soviet viewpoint to the Sub-Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My concern is that in undertaking an inquiry of the magnitude of this report into human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Soviet Union no funds- I repeat, no funds- were made available for the Committee to enable it to ensure it had available to it those witnesses whom it sought in order to carry out its inquiries or inspections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Certainly, we as parliamentarians profess to represent a country in which respect for human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and civil liberties is paramount although we do have certain blind spots of our own where we choose to ignore repression of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Such inquiries in almost all cases would bring to the attention of the Australian people, at least temporarily, the extent to which civil liberties and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people to act freely and to practise freedom as they believe in it exists throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are, in fact, repeated blatant denials of the fundamental <span class="highlight">rights</span> which should be accorded to every citizen in 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this report is adjudged to be prejudiced, to lack foundation in fact or to utter one intemperate comment, the report, the Committee, this House and this Parliament could stand condemned by every individual concerned with the protection of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our Parliament could be ridiculed by institutions in other countries and by world bodies keen to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and privileges, and to promote the responsibilities, of the individual in a complex, competitive and jealous world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In accepting this reference on Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics the Sub-committee placed itself in an invidious position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The human <span class="highlight">rights</span> campaign was designed to replace the old bankrupt anti-communist and anti-Soviet tenets which no longer can serve as the basis for foreign policy … the same naked anti communism with its corollary of attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries is still there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Zorin was commenting on the position of the United States of America and what he considers was its pretended concern for human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We received testimony from 25 witnesses with different backgrounds, experience and knowledge on human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the USSR. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The human <span class="highlight">rights</span> movement throughout the world was responsible for the ultimate release by the Soviet authorities of Leonid Plyushch and the permission which was granted to him to leave the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be clear to any reader of the transcript of the public evidence which is available, or from this report, that witnesses were called to give their evidence because of expertise on the Soviet Union and its application of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>, and not for their political allegiance or philosophy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is there recommended that the Australian Parliament establish a standing committee on human <span class="highlight">rights</span> to report on serious violations of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in any country, including Australia- I emphasise the words ‘including Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are several members of both Houses who, from time to time, take action to express a view to representatives of another State on some event or series of events which have occurred, or to condemn a government for denying basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, some have presented letters of protest and petitions to USSR Embassy officials expressing views on the lack of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> being granted to individuals in their country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is recognised that it will always be difficult to obtain evidence from governments of other countries of suppression of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That should not be a disability to members of this House who are anxious to see every government adopt and practice the tenets of the Universal Declaration of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> or the Helsinki Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The appointment of a parliamentary committee for that purpose gives honourable members the opportunity to ascertain whether human <span class="highlight">rights</span> are being ignored in another country and, if affirmed, to register their concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I respectfully suggest to those honourable members that it is naive to suggest that any parliamentary committee investigating a reference of this type- that is, the deprivation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in another state- could ever obtain the total evidence which would be available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Annex H of the report we note, for example, that Pastor Grivans was sponsored by the Latvian Evangelical Lutheran Church of Australia, that it helped to bring that gentleman to this country; that  Mr Victors  Kalnins was sponsored by the Latvian Relief Society of Australia; that Leonid Plyushch was sponsored by the Victorian division of the Ukrainian Committee for the Defence of Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>; that the Rev. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the parliament may not have been responsible for the payment of the fares of some of those witnesses is, I respectfully suggest, an irrelevant argument to condemn that part of the evidence which has been used by the Sub-Committee to support its findings of the denial of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The participating states will respect human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and fundamental freedoms including the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by considering one matter which the Committee was careful to determine early in its deliberations and that is the question whether an investigation by a parliamentary committee into human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the USSR would have an adverse affect in the Soviet Union on those people whom the Committee was anxious to support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost without exception witness after witness confirmed that the Committee’s actual hearing, let alone its final report and recommendation, was of considerable assistance to those within the Soviet Union who were seeking to establish human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He referred in particular to the Soviet Union being a super power which, because of the enunciation of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Soviet citizens in the Constitution, wants the world to believe that those <span class="highlight">rights</span> are enjoyed by every citizen in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this report goes some way to demonstrate the hypocrisy and deceit of that regime in its application of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and therefore of the regime itself, then we have succeeded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be also my wish that every member of the Red Army Russian Song and Dance Company, presently touring Australia, could return to their homeland with a copy of the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Soviet Union report made to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a member of the Sub-Committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence which prepared the report on human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Soviet Union, I would like to make a few points. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why the present position in respect of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> exists in the Soviet Union, as illustrated in this report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make one point in relation to human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Soviet Union and in relation to the nationality question: I do not necessarily support nationalistic claims, whether they be by people who originated in the Baltic States or in the Ukraine, those of Jews and so on and tend to oppose nationalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to make a couple of points about human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that those of us who have been interested in the question of freedom and the question of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Soviet Union and in other countries know- the report emphasises it in its first conclusions- that there have been positive changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the greatest number of cases the practice has been that the most effective way is not criminal prosecution but striking at a person’s mode of existence- his job level of income and so on- and administrative measures such as the reduction of certain <span class="highlight">rights</span> and advantages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee has aimed in its report on Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in the Soviet Union to present an objective, factual body of material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From this information the Committee has drawn a number of conclusions which to a large extent are based on the testimony of witnesses whom the SubCommittee on Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> had sought due to their personal experience in the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other speakers have outlined the justification for the production of the report on human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Soviet Union and some of its findings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A major area in which the Soviet Union represses human <span class="highlight">rights</span> concerns ethnic minorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further example of repression of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> is the restriction on a citizen’s intention to permanently move to another part of the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The West cannot ensure Soviet compliance with the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> provisions of our report or of the Final Act of the Helsinki Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, one of the key aspects of the Agreement is that, for the first time, good relations between nations are linked explicitly with observance of internationally agreed upon principles on human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most notable international efforts to counter human <span class="highlight">rights</span> violations in the Soviet Union has been the campaign against Soviet abuse of psychiatry for political purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report makes several recommendations on what the West can do to secure improved human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia should insist that a regard for human <span class="highlight">rights</span> be part of Australia’s relationship with the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should take the opportunities presented by bilateral discussions or negotiations between the two governments and cultural, academic and scientific exchanges between individuals to express its disapproval of Soviet breaches of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> commitments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, Australia’s international position with regard to human <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be much stronger once the Australian Government ratifies the international convenant on civil and political <span class="highlight">rights</span> which it signed in 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Soviet Union sometimes claims a lack of understanding in the West of its case on human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Soviet Union of course is not the only offender regarding the violation of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>; there are some other nations where attention needs to be directed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the report highlights is that basic human <span class="highlight">rights</span> of any kind at all are denied to anyone who dissents even slightly from the Soviet Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend this report, as other speakers have done, to the reading of anyone who has just the remotest interest in human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would our position be if we were to inquire into the question of civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the negro minority in the United States? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We accept on the available evidence that there are serious denials of human and civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the USSR, particularly with reference to minorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would reiterate our view that based on the substantial evidence available the civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> of certain groups,  especially minorities, in the Soviet Union are seriously infringed and fall below that which should be expected in any civilised society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have made the point that paragraph 65 of the conclusions and recommendations, which recommends the establishment of a Standing Committee on Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span>, would do damage not only to the Parliament but also to Australia’s relations with other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have made the point that there are serious infringements of civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> but that this occurs in probably 75 per cent of the countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those reasons, whilst I accept completely that there are infringements of civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Soviet Union, I am one of those who feel that the recommendation in paragraph 65 and the original reference of the matter to the SubCommittee can do untold harm to Australia in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As a member of the Sub-Committee on Human <span class="highlight">Rights</span> in the Soviet Union, which undertook this inquiry, I want to speak for a few moments on this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if we have anything in us at all we have to be concerned with human <span class="highlight">rights</span> round the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are concerned here with civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> not only in the Soviet Union but also throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>God alone knows, there is a lack of civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> in that area . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are the members of this other committee, because of remarks that have been made by certain people in this House and in the other House, to ignore the lack of human <span class="highlight">rights</span> that has already become evident to that committee? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because they trade where they want to trade there is an extra responsibility on us as members of Parliament to show that we are concerned in taking evidence about human <span class="highlight">rights</span> round the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, the important aspect of this document is that a group of members from both sides of this Parliament was given the responsibility to look into human <span class="highlight">rights</span> in the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would not be a bad idea if we started with some equal <span class="highlight">rights</span> in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Human <span class="highlight">rights</span> everywhere are important; it is the duty and obligation of free people everywhere to uphold them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, one would have to be blind to not recognise that inside the Soviet Union there are great deprivations of human <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, in my view the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of humanity transcend the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of sovereignty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not suggesting that we become as dramatic as that but it would not hurt us to get into’ the international arena and point out wherever human <span class="highlight">rights</span> are being trampled on, and try to use whatever influence we have with the people with whom we deal to have those <span class="highlight">rights</span> restored to suffering humanity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is exercising a judicial role in the same way as a judge and I believe that in this situation, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case and having regard to the serious question of ministerial responsibility, you ought to find for the Parliament being able to deal with those issues of ministerial responsibility but being able to deal with them in a way which cannot and should not affect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of any person charged before the courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The debate on the Bills to be dealt with next week will bring the whole matter into the forefront of what we are about in this country when we are talking about civil <span class="highlight">rights</span> of people, their <span class="highlight">rights</span> of privacy and their right to be protected against malicious prosecution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#debate-65">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was our policy, I believe correctly, that since the Northern Territory in particular is rapidly proceeding towards full independence- it has a new constitution and the same <span class="highlight">rights</span> as other States of the Commonwealth- therefore it would not be proper for a committee of the Federal Parliament to involve itself in its activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is suggested that the following sub-section be inserted after sub-section (3):  (3a) Where, in proceeding in a court in respect of an offence, objection is taken to the admission of evidence on the ground that the evidence was obtained in contravention of, or in consequence of a contravention of, or in consequence of a failure to comply with, a provision of this Act, in relation to a person, the court shall not admit the evidence unless it is, on the balance of probabilities, satisfied that admission of the evidence would specifically and substantially benefit the public interest without unduly prejudicing the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms of any person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as I am concerned, it is right and proper that any such information should be conveyed to the security service, but I have very grave doubts whether it is proper in a society such as ours that there should be an ability to pass on this type of special information to the police that could be prejudicial to the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we have here what can be regarded as the chronic difficulty of distinguishing between the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the people to be protected against too effusive action on the part of the bureaucracy and the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual to be able to sustain his proper position in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have another indication of the fact that it is for the Parliament to exercise caution and to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual, unless its actions are manifestly shown to be in the security interests of the Commonwealth and of the people of the Commonwealth and that they are necessary in the case of narcotics abuse or narcotics use, unless such use has been authorised by an authorised medical officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But we did stress very strongly- indeed some of our amendments were accepted- that we clearly need to protect the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of citizens if this power should ever need to be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the tragedies of parliamentary life is that so few people are interested in the intrusion into the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether, despite the provisions of the legislation, members of the Australian Federal Police will be able to resist the temptation to pass on to their State counterparts information which they have accidentally gathered as a result of the special <span class="highlight">rights</span> now being given to them to assist them in their pursuit of narcotics dealers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by inserting after sub-section (3) the following sub-sections: “(3a) Where, in proceedings in a court in respect of an offence, objection is taken to the admission of evidence on the ground that the evidence was obtained in contravention of, or in consequence of a contravention of, or in consequence of a failure to comply with, a provision of this Act, in relation to a person, the court shall not admit the evidence unless it is, on the balance of probabilities, satisfied that admission of the evidence would specifically and substantially benefit the public interest without unduly prejudicing the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms of any person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a guarantee of a double onus in this new section, that where there is a suggestion that one had evidence which is illegal and cannot be used, there is still a chance for the prosecution to say that the gravity of the situation is such that it is in the public interest to use it and that it would not unduly prejudice the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and freedoms of any person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many ramifications of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> which can legitimately be commented on in debating this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: whilst not opposing the Bill, the House is of the opinion that the Government as soon as possible should extend by legislation the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aborigines in the Northern Territory to Aborigines in the Australian Capital Territory ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole aim and spirit of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation indicates that this land should be dealt with on the same basis as any other land which is assigned, recognised and reserved for Aborigines as their traditional land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Land councils have shown themselves not always to be fully apprised of the <span class="highlight">rights</span> and interests of local traditional land owners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is to amend the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and it refers to the Northern Territory, so we will scrub - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Drummond)Ruling on the point of order, I believe that this debate is a free-ranging one that could encompass most arguments regarding Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the second reading speech of the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs  (Mr Viner)  stated, the point of this Bill is to clarify the intention of some sections of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and to give assistance in certain cases to people who are drawn into litigation which has been caused by that Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In speaking to the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill, I refer to the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Capricornia  (Dr Everingham). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party introduced the land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation in 1975 following the Woodward report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The incoming Liberal-Country Party Government introduced its own style of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it can be said in all fairness that, although we differ on the emphasis in and the areas dealt with by the legislation on the question of land <span class="highlight">rights</span> there has over the last four or five years been what could in some respects be called a bipartisan policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People can talk about health, education, housing and all sorts of things but unless the Aboriginal people who still live in tribal communities are given land <span class="highlight">rights</span> the other things do not seem to matter a great deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that there have been attempts to get the Commonwealth Government and the two States to agree on a central area for the Pitjantjatjara which would satisfy their land <span class="highlight">rights</span> claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of years ago the South Australian Labor Government took the first step in establishing land <span class="highlight">rights</span> for Aboriginals when it set up the Aboriginal Lands Trust in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it was necessary for other legislation to be introduced to give effect to land <span class="highlight">rights</span> claims in a way similar to that which the Commonwealth Government has introduced for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The South Australian Government introduced what was called the Pitjantjatjara Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course with the defeat of the Labor Government in South Australia a couple of months ago, that Pitjantjatjara Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill has now lapsed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the question of mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be given attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the remarks made by the present Premier of South Australia and by the Liberal member representing that area, there is a possibility that mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span> will be excluded from the .operations of the new Pitjantjatjara Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> Bill when it is introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that in his discussions with the new South Australian Government he will do his utmost to see that this question of mineral <span class="highlight">rights</span> is not taken out of the Bill for these people who, as I say, are still in a tribalised state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sincerely hope that the Federal Minister, in his discussions with the South Australian Government, will ensure that the full <span class="highlight">rights</span> of these people are protected and that he will use his influence with the South Australian Liberal Government to see that they are protected in a manner similar to the way in which the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of Aboriginals in the Northern Territory have been protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I approached the honourable member to see whether he would be prepared to debate the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Bill that night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our submission we made the point that Labor policy is committed to legislation and constitutional reform to protect individual <span class="highlight">rights</span> and the right to privacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-37-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an understandable struggle for human <span class="highlight">rights</span> and self-determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In both of these discretionary areas, the Commissioner’s decision will be open to the usual <span class="highlight">rights</span> of objection and appeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such amendments may be made whether or not the employee has exercised the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of objection and appeal that the law provides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1 977 the Council of the Australian National University adopted new fee rules which provided for exemption from compulsory membership of and payment of fees to approved student bodies and gave <span class="highlight">rights</span> of appeal to any students dissatisfied with decisions on these issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second fact is that in the past there has been a denial of student status and student <span class="highlight">rights</span> by some university administrations around the country to those students who refused to pay the compulsory student union levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to safeguard students’ <span class="highlight">rights</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Companies holding current onshore petroleum exploration or mining licences, permits, leases, <span class="highlight">rights</span> or interests therein are issued and registered under State mining laws will be able to take advantage of the concession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-55-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will also provide for full disclosure of relevant information to incoming franchisees, <span class="highlight">rights</span> for franchisees to continuation of supplies, without discrimination in the event of any shortage, and <span class="highlight">rights</span> of assignment of their franchises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-56-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have received a large number of representations from members and the general community concerning the granting by the Australian Cricket Board of exclusive television <span class="highlight">rights</span> to cricket coverage to a commercial network. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the proposed examination of Aboriginal land <span class="highlight">rights</span> legislation referred to by the Minister on 1 3 November 1 979 be without detriment to the basic principles of the Act; if so, will the power of veto possessed by the Aboriginal community over developments at Jabiluka not be abrogated as a result of this examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-58-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my statement of 13 November I emphasised that the examination would be without detriment to the basic principles of the Act; and I further stated in the Senate on IS November during the passage of the Aboriginal Land <span class="highlight">Rights</span> (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill that the right of veto is a matter of principle and, therefore, outside the scope of the review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-58-18">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He said that he would examine the <span class="highlight">rights</span> to employment in the Commonwealth Public Service of a person imprisoned under the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that no government could justify a situation in which it denies forever the <span class="highlight">rights</span> of these persons to employment in the Commonwealth Public Service or in other areas because of their criminal record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And that this procedure providing for selection by a method of chance is an unfair and arbitrary imposition on the human <span class="highlight">rights</span> of a minority and discriminates against certain of the young male persons in the community in favour of others solely by reason of their respective dates of birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When it is desirous to have people conciliate one can inform them of their <span class="highlight">rights</span> and inform them that certain facilities are available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
