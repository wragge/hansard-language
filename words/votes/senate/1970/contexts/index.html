<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Is he aware that a meeting held at Richmond Town Hall, Victoria, on 2nd February 1970 to discuss the Moratorium Campaign a motion was carried by 102 <span class="highlight">votes</span> to 86 to remove from the Moratorium Campaign policy statement the wordsthat all actions taken be of a peaceful and nonviolent nature’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the considerable delay in finalising the result of the Australian Capital Territory by-election due to the existing provisions of section 96 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, I ask: Has the Minister given consideration to fixing an earlier cut-off period for the lodgment of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many honourable senators may recall that eventually a motion which was moved by me - and I well remember it - to increase the allowance of a senator by Si 50 was carried by 31 vo’.es to 16 <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we do not want this chamber put on a course by little more than half its <span class="highlight">votes</span> at any one point of time without the balance of the Senate being really in agreement and willing to go along and work for that particular pattern of operating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Democratic Labor Party thinks that any piece of legislation which is considered next week should be amended, my colleagues and I will certainly provide our <span class="highlight">votes</span> to support such an amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time the Commonwealth has not been invited nor has it decided to enter upon direct assistance for primary education,  rt  will be remembered that the Commonwealth has assisted by substantial <span class="highlight">votes</span> the increase of teachers, thereby enabling a greater number of teachers to be available in the schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700827_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary for me to add only that in addition to these very sound <span class="highlight">votes</span> of great increases that the Commonwealth has made, due to the policy of increasing State grants, the States by their own efforts over the last 10 years have increased their expenditure on education from $325m ten years ago to $898m this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700827_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party always <span class="highlight">votes</span> with the Government against my Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is not the fact that 4 major parties each polled approximately 1 million <span class="highlight">votes</span> the truest possible indication of the existence of free elections? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When can senators expect to see a preview of a film aimed at educating voters to avoid informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the forthcoming Senate election, the commentary for which is to be given by Bill Peach who spearheaded the successful ‘This Day Tonight’ programme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister approved any proposals to ensure that as far as practicable a minimum of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> will be registered at the forthcoming Senate election? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the voting system operating in Holland provide for absentee voting rights: for example, can crews of the North Sea fishing fleet delegate to other members of their family the right to exercise proxy <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one of those who has supported the general principle which has been spoken about on the occasions when <span class="highlight">votes</span> have been taken in this chamber, I indicate that I shall adopt the attitude which was described by <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  comments on ratification are correct, in that 950 producer country <span class="highlight">votes</span> are required for ratification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4 being dealt with concurrently and at the end of the debate, <span class="highlight">votes</span> being taken on each separately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the end of the debate I suggest that the <span class="highlight">votes</span> be taken separately on the Bills and any amendments that may be moved, and that after disposal of the Bills a simple vote be taken on the notice of motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take it that his wish would be to have separate decisions taken by separate <span class="highlight">votes</span>, because he has 2 separate amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">votes</span> will be taken separately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a company holds 200 or more hives, it is entitled to one vote; the shareholders in that company do not receive <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy President,  for the convenience of honourable senators I suggest that the second reading debate on the next 7 Bills on the notice paper, namely, the Dairying Industry Bill 1972, the Processed Milk Products Bounty Bill 1972, the Dairying Research Bill 1972, the Dairying Research Levy Bill 1972, the Dairy Produce Sales Promotion Bill 1972, the Butter Fat Levy Bill 1972. and the Dairy Research Levy Collection Bill 1972, be taken together and that at the conclusion of the debate <span class="highlight">votes</span> be taken separately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, unless otherwise ordered, the <span class="highlight">votes</span> be considered in the same groupings and order as in the Estimates committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am told that a list setting out the proposed groupings and order for the consideration of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> has been circulated for the information of honourable senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the <span class="highlight">votes</span> for the group of departments covered by Estimates Committee A be now passed without requests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I merely rise to say that the Australian Democratic Labor Party supports the provisions contained in this Bill and we will be casting our <span class="highlight">votes</span> accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime each senator has been issued with a copy of a return showing the <span class="highlight">votes</span> recorded at each polling place and Sub-division in the State he represents and each Member of the House of Representatives has been issued with a copy of a return showing the <span class="highlight">votes</span> recorded at each polling place and Sub-division in the Division he represents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is only reasonable that we ought to support any law which gives equality of <span class="highlight">votes</span> to all citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-It must seem very peculiar to people overseas that in Australia one Party can receive more <span class="highlight">votes</span> than another Party and yet obtain fewer seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Is the Leader of the Government in the Senate aware of the urgent call which was made within the past 24 hours by, I think, the former  Chairman  of the World Bank,  Mr McNamara,  that massive starvation will occur in the underdeveloped areas of the world within a year unless those countries able to do so substantially increase their aid <span class="highlight">votes</span> to meet this threat? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question is: ‘That the <span class="highlight">votes</span> related to the departments covered by group B be passed without request’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) That clauses 1 to 6 and the First Schedule be postponed until after the consideration of the Second Schedule; (2) that, unless otherwise ordered, the <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the Second Schedule be considered in the same groupings and order as in the Estimates Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question is: ‘That the <span class="highlight">votes</span> for departments in group E be now passed without request’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the Minister for Primary Industry seen the report in today’s ‘Australian’ that the Government is to spend $2 7 m to buy <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the <span class="highlight">votes</span> would be taken separately as if the Bills were being debated separately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I suggest that <span class="highlight">votes</span> concerning each of the days be taken separately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over the last 30 sitting days of the Parliament he has chosen to support the Government 49 times in <span class="highlight">votes</span> in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) That clauses 1 to 7 and the First Schedule be postponed till after consideration of the Second Schedule; (2) that, unless otherwise ordered, the <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the Second Schedule be considered in the same groupings and order as in Estimates Committees B, C, D, E, F, G and A respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that it would serve the purposes of the Senate- I am sure it would be appreciated by the Committee of the Whole- if future debate were confined to the actual items of expenditure included in the <span class="highlight">votes</span> under consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this table shows is that between 1949 and 1974 the party which obtained the majority of the primary <span class="highlight">votes</span>, except for one year, 1954, obtained the majority of seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Out of that independence which the richness of an income of $15,000 a year gives to me, I maintain that my attitude in this matter is not actuated in the slightest degree by political <span class="highlight">votes</span>, of which throughout my whole career I have been just as independent as I have been of Ministers and party leaders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As if political <span class="highlight">votes</span> afford any advantage to me at my stage of parliamentary experience! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition proposes to insert after clause 29 proposed new clause 29a which, in effect, is a consequence of the Opposition’s proposed new section 88a dealing with general postal voters, and provides for the numbering or other means of marking of automatic postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> issued under the proposed system of registering certain electors as general postal voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This proposed omission accords with the proposed omission of section 92 (2) of the Act by clause 30 of the Bill and is in line with the Government’s proposition that completed postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> be transmitted to the divisional returning officer or the division concerned rather than being posted or delivered to another official for onwards transmission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present system gives us the Australian Democratic Labor Party which <span class="highlight">votes</span> for issues on their merits and, whether people like us or not, honourable senators will find that, throughout the community, people will say that since the Australian Democratic Labor Party has been represented here the Senate has never functioned better in its capacity as a House of review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Votes</span> were involved and the Government was quite prepared to tolerate a situation in which the wheat industry would get into a mess, as it has, because if the Government attempted to interfere at any time it might lose <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was led up the garden path by people in the Government who refused to provide any leadership and who were actuated only by one thing - the fear that if they opposed the people running the wheat industry they might lose <span class="highlight">votes</span> In those circumstances I say we will vote for this measure, but in the future I hope we will get a little bit of leadership from the Government for the wheat industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is cheap in money and it is cheap in <span class="highlight">votes</span> because if every 20-year-old or every 22-year-old or every young able bodied man in the community were conscripted there would be a wave of reaction through the families which were affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Old  argument about ‘my country right or wrong’ carried some weight with the majority of the Australian people  and  that those who were opposed to the war were accused of sabotaging in some way the war effort, of stabbing our boys in the back, and we were losing some <span class="highlight">votes</span> at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one felt that there were <span class="highlight">votes</span> to be gained and offices to be won by supporting the war in Vietnam, and that even if one felt it was wrong that would be a reason for supporting it, I do not believe that the Labor Party came into existence merely to acquire jobs for people who were looking for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that in the debate honourable senators express their points of view and, having expressed their points of view, we then have <span class="highlight">votes</span> on them so that we can get the Bill to the other place as quickly as we can. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that, when he asked a leading member of the German Government why these measures for a free economy had been applied to everything except farming, the answer was that there were too many <span class="highlight">votes</span> involved in the agricultural areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite obvious that  Senator Greenwood  has a very short memory because a matter of 500 or 600 <span class="highlight">votes</span> in a few seats - no more than  A  - throughout Australia on the occasion of the last House of Representatives election determined whether the Labor Party would govern in its own right or the coalition would be returned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask him: Does he think that the Government is enhancing Australia’s prestige by stopping one person from coming here, irrespective of whether this person wants to speak at a meeting which is being held to protest against the declared policy of the Government and which has the support, one may say from the <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast in the last general election, of practically half the population of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am asking that my amendment, which is in terms similar to an amendment of mine which was carried on 1 1th June last by 28 <span class="highlight">votes</span> to 23 <span class="highlight">votes</span>, will be endorsed by the Senate today, so that this will be the first matter referred to the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare, one of the committees which have been talked about so glibly and so graciously, as a matter of fact, over a long period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What happens in relation to this motion is that the Opposition parties express their opinions of the Budget, but any decision to defeat the Budget depends not upon this vote but upon <span class="highlight">votes</span> which will be taken upon subsequent Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Agreement shall, for the Governments which have deposited instruments of ratification, approval or acceptance, enter into force definitely as soon after 30 June 1971 as such instruments have been deposited on behalf of Governments representing at least six producing countries as set out in annex A holding together at least 950 of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> set out in that annex and at least nine consuming countries as set out in annex B holding together at least 300 of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> set out in that annex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This seems to me a pretty onerous kind of definitive ratification of the Agreement when the 6 depositing countries that are required to ratify the Agreement have to control at least 950 of the 1,000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> that are available to the producing countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>provided that such instruments or notifications have been deposited with the depositary Government: By 30 June 1971 or, if the Third Agreement is extended, by the date of termination of that Agreement; and On behalf of Governments representing at least six producing countries as set out in annex A holding together at least 950 of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> set out in that annex, and at least nine consuming countries as set out in annex B holding together at least 300 of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> set out in that annex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 think it is important to note that this group of <span class="highlight">votes</span> may be judged in its importance by the fact that in cash terms its proposed expenditure is $l,579m in a total vote under the whole of these Estimates of some $2,934m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am disappointed that it has become apparent that the Commonwealth Government is coasting along in this regard simply because, to my mind, there are not many <span class="highlight">votes</span> to be won in public transport seeing that most people want to use their own cars and, in the main, it is only the under age, the very old and the very poor who have lo use the public transport system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now we have reached the stage where the Government is using this matter to show a solidarity in its organisation, a solidarity in the Democratic Labor Party, and divisions in the Labor Party because the Labor Party is the only honest group which <span class="highlight">votes</span> according to its conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior whether voting facilities can be provided for the recording of absentee <span class="highlight">votes</span> in any polling booth throughout Australia at the next Commonwealth election without the need for amendments to the existing Commonwealth Electoral Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No longer can this discredited Government, with its ‘how can we best win <span class="highlight">votes</span>’ attitude to such major questions as war and peace, frighten the Australian electorate with its images of the great yellow peril or of Chinese hordes descending upon us, because they no longer wash in the eyes of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time the Government came within one seat of not being returned; in fact,  15  <span class="highlight">votes</span> against the Government would have made the difference to its continuation in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Turning to the question of the Budget winning <span class="highlight">votes</span>, if the unemployment position was markedly reduced by the time of the election some people might accept the fact that the Government knew what it was doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wish to ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts, ls it a fact that at 2 recent international conferences Australia managed to record 2 different <span class="highlight">votes</span> on the same subject of a 10-year moratorium on the commercial killing of whales? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not prepared to put its foot down about anything because it thinks that its action might affect <span class="highlight">votes</span> at the next election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think on 4 occasions in the Journal I have written: Put not your trust in political parties because either party will sell you down the river as fast as it can if it thinks it can win <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this way we would avoid absentee <span class="highlight">votes</span> and other problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that on an election eve he might want to score in this regard for purposes of the election and I forgive him for that, but I repeat that this issue will endure past the election and is far more important to Australia than his getting <span class="highlight">votes</span> from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some 70 people are involved - a major group - and there is no reason why the Government should not extend itself a little and at least forward applications for postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> before the writs are issued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>election date might be extended to November, or even to December as seems to be favoured by some sections of the Liberal Parly, or to January as is favoured by another section - after all Santa Claus might bring <span class="highlight">votes</span> at Christmas and the Government may be able to afford to postpone the election until January - but under the Constitution the date cannot be extended beyond 20th January. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In every election since I have lived in South Australia - and I went there in 1950  -  the Labor Party has polled more than 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to put on record that after the redistribution took place in South Australia the Labor Party received less <span class="highlight">votes</span> at the 1970 election than it received at the 1968 election when it could not win the government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can voting facilities be provided for the recording of absentee <span class="highlight">votes</span> in any polling booth throughout Australia at the next Commonwealth election without the necessity of amending the Commonwealth Electoral Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Electoral Bill which the Minister for the Interior introduced on 31st March 1971 contains provisions which would enable electors to record absent <span class="highlight">votes</span> at polling booths throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will not be a rushed action designed to gain a few lousy <span class="highlight">votes</span> in an election by condemning the Government over something which it has not yet had time to consider. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This order of the day relates to the Commonwealth Electoral Bill 1972, the purpose of which is to provide <span class="highlight">votes</span> for 18-year- olds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>5m be provided in the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the Department of the Interior for expenditure on Aboriginal advancement in the Northern Territory, $305,000 in the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the Department of Labour and National Service, S3. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In previous years these amounts for the Departments of Education and Science and Health were included in the Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account, and it would therefore be appropriate to compare last year’s provision in the Trust Account of $ 1 4.83m with total provision this year of $26.5m for the same purposes; but it has been thought more appropriate that provision should be made from now on in the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the functional departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question is not whether we will in appropriate circumstances support or oppose the principle of <span class="highlight">votes</span> for 18 year olds but whether we support the passage of a Bill of this nature at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1961 the DLP received 472,578 <span class="highlight">votes</span>, which was 9.82 per cent of the total vote, but it was not able to have one candidate elected to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same election - I repeat that I am not being critical of it - the Country Party received 489,000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> or about 82,000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> more than the Democratic Labor Party and obtained 20 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But in the country electorates there would be some Liberal Party <span class="highlight">votes</span> which would counterpoise that argument to some degree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the last House of Representatives election, which was held in 1969, the DLP received 367,977 <span class="highlight">votes</span> and obtained no seats at all, whereas the Country Party had the usual record in relation to its vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There was proper scrutiny and proper accounting of <span class="highlight">votes</span> and ballot papers, and I could find no fault during an attempted objective assessment when going around polling booths both in Saigon and in one of the new provinces to which we were lifted by helicopter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>You double the number of candidates that you want and you divide that into the number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> and add one, which gives  50  per cent plus one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I am concerned the whole of the Labor Party’s approach to the question of <span class="highlight">votes</span> for 18-year-olds has been phoney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to note that on that occasion, on 21st April 1970, the Government defeated the Labor Party amendment by 61 <span class="highlight">votes</span> to 52. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I feel that the Government by making this move at this time will gain many <span class="highlight">votes</span>, particularly from Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Withers  addressed that conference on his own behalf and on behalf of  Senator Durack  and myself in declaring our support for <span class="highlight">votes</span> for 18-year-olds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In a few words these are many of the reasons why I sup port <span class="highlight">votes</span> for 18-year-olds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we believe that the best interests of Australia will be served by giving <span class="highlight">votes</span> to people at whatever age it may be - in this case 18-year-olds - then I suggest this must be the criteria upon which we should make our judgments and decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall continue to use my endeavours, and try to harness the endeavours of my colleagues who support <span class="highlight">votes</span> for 18-year-olds, to convince the Government that it should introduce this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was an example of a government seeking to gain an advantage by giving the vote to another age group, but it was surprised to find that the people in that age group cast their <span class="highlight">votes</span> more in favour of the Conservative Party than for the irrational Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 think it could be said that, if 18-year-olds were entitled to vote, their <span class="highlight">votes</span> would be in the mould of their parents’ <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is to take from every person in the Australian community who <span class="highlight">votes</span> for the Democratic Labor Party - there are close enough to 500,000 of them - the right to have an effective franchise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party says that it will let those people vote for the Democratic Labor Party but it will make their <span class="highlight">votes</span> ineffective in the final analysis by having the first past the post system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Proportional representation allows every person in the community to express freely his political point of view without the penalty of disenfranchisement because he <span class="highlight">votes</span> for a minority group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many of the people in  Senator Bishop’s  Party today advocate first past the post voting as the millenium of all reforms because at this point, according to the <span class="highlight">votes</span> his Party is now getting, it will advantage his Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite sure that  Senator Little  will accord with that view because his Party, the Democratic Labor Party, is represented  in the Senate whereas although the percentage of <span class="highlight">votes</span> it gains at each election would normally entitle it to some representation in the House of Representatives if that chamber were a truly representative assembly, it has no representation there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In effective terms, if there were some 5 or 6 candidates standing, there could be a situation where the one who polled 21 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> was the candidate who was elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then  Senator McManus  went on - this hurt me - to point out that the Australian Labor Party, when it finds that certain aspects of a Bill will be defeated if it keeps up its opposition, turns round the next time the Bill comes into this chamber and <span class="highlight">votes</span> for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask  Senator Gair,  when he speaks and <span class="highlight">votes</span> on this matter, to consider the objections that he,  Senator Kane  and  Mr John  Maynes took to the original proposals of the previous Government when it decided late in 1971 to impose all the strictures on the union movement which would have stopped the right wing unions as well as the left wing unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is simply that honourable senators opposite do not follow and cannot accept what was accepted overwhelmingly by the majority of the Australian people, when the Labor Party received more <span class="highlight">votes</span> than the combined vote of all the other political parties in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To squeal unfair and to want to alter the system so that the Labor Party may win with a minority of <span class="highlight">votes</span> will fool no-one, least of all the average decent sensible Australian who, whilst pretty easy going about many matters, will not be fooled by cheap political slogans which he knows instinctively to be untrue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 have heard some Australian Labor Party supporters contend that it will be a big advantage to their Party, but I understand that in some places where it has been tried it has not been found to have a very considerable effect upon the percentage of <span class="highlight">votes</span> received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An examination of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast on that occasion reveals that 25 senators voted in favour of retaining the excise and 23 voted against retaining it and that 3 South Australian supporters of the then government were paired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the light of the new development in the Senate with the emergence of independent senators, we should look at the Standing Orders to see whether there is some way in which the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of honourable senators in respect of a particular matter can be registered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If tonight the Labor Party in this Senate <span class="highlight">votes</span> to reject the motion seeking the establishment of this select com mittee there can be one reason and one reason only for it doing so; it is covering up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to make this comment: Whilst this is primarily a Senate matter - I can understand that perhaps the Government has no need for pairs in this place; it may think that it will always be in the minority if the 3 Opposition groups combine and therefore a pair or two does not matter, and that whether the Government loses by one vote or by 4 <span class="highlight">votes</span> is immaterial - I, of course, must have discussions with my parliamentary leader, the Leader of the Opposition in another place, because if the same course were adopted by the Opposition in the other place - at this moment I have no knowledge of whether it would be adopted - the working of government would become impossible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that what  Senator Withers, Senator Greenwood, Senator Wright  and  Senator Young  are putting to the Senate and to the Australian people, that the 3 <span class="highlight">votes</span> that  Senator Young  claims were denied tonight were <span class="highlight">votes</span> automatically to be cast in support of the motion submitted by the Democratic Labor Party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that what parliamentary democracy is about, that those <span class="highlight">votes</span> would have automatically been for the adoption of the motion? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would not be equality and the provision of a 10 per cent variation instead of 20 per cent is not going to make <span class="highlight">votes</span> any more equal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the simple fact is that if one looks at the statistics of the primary <span class="highlight">votes</span> of this country over a period of some  30  years one will find that the party or the group of parties that received the greatest primary vote took office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last election we had a situation in the 2 electorates of Chifley and Gwydir where Chifley had approximately 65,000 people and Gwydir had approximately 46,000 people recording <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we take that difference of 20,000 and apply it throughout other divisions of the Commonwealth it is undeniable that the surplus of <span class="highlight">votes</span> can be skilfully juggled to maintain the number of what are now Opposition strongholds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, the Committee concluded that it should recommend the inclusion in the Constitution of provisions ensuring the regular review of the electoral divisions of each State and also accord near uniformity to the value accorded to the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the electors for each of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other day I was reading a statement by a South Australian, politician - this will appeal to the Minister for Works  (Senator Cavanagh)  in which he pointed out that in the recent election in that State the Labor Party received SI per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> and won 57 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He believes in the system under which 10 honourable senators can each receive 18,000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> but a man who stands for Parliament and receives 200,000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> does not obtain a seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On that occasion the split was caused by the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of one-quarter of the Labor membership of this country which determined on the split in opposition to the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of three-quarters of the Labor membership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat also that if .the principle of one vote one value is to be tested it has to be applied to an electoral system so, in the end, the conjunction of all the electorates and their results produce a majority of <span class="highlight">votes</span> and a majority of seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I say, if we were to remove the electorate of Darling from New South Wales and leave in the electorate of Eden-Monaro - it would take 2 days to drive around its 122 polling places - one country vote at the last general election was equal to 1.04 extra metropolitan <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We also have a preferential system of voting which enables the person who <span class="highlight">votes</span> to have a second or a third choice which is taken into consideration if his man does not get enough primary <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I clearly recall how many <span class="highlight">votes</span> were discarded as informal because the voter had placed ‘1’ against the name df the candidate that he wanted but had not placed any other figures against the names of the other candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has been reiterated during the course of this debate that the strength of political parties in the Parliament has reflected the number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> that were cast for them in the electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been amazed at times at the reflection of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast because the <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast for  a  certain political party were in no way reflected in the percentage of members returned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus, the Committee concluded that it should recommend the inclusion in the Constitution of provisions ensuring the regular review of the electoral divisions of each State and also accord near uniformity to the value accorded to the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the electors for each of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Year in and year out, on the total aggregate of <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast throughout Australia at Federal elections, generally speaking the Labor movement has secured more <span class="highlight">votes</span> than the total <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the Liberal Party, Country Party and Democratic Labor Party put together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the last election we received the overwhelming number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> and for the first time, thank goodness, despite the gerrymander of the honourable senator’s Party in 1965, the electoral weight of the people was so much against the then Government that they threw it out of office and now we are trying to bring parliamentary democracy back into the Australian electorate by reducing the 20 per cent disparity to what was normal custom, practice and tradition until 1965. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1966, 40 per cent of the Australian electors showed by their <span class="highlight">votes</span> that they wanted a Labor government while 57.2 per cent showed they did not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1969, 47 per cent showed by their <span class="highlight">votes</span> that they wanted Labor government while 49.4 per cent were decisively opposed to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not disguise the fact that this Government has never won the support of the majority of the Australian electors, that it has never won 50 per cent plus one of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> in any election held from 1958 up to and including 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since 1958, the present electoral system has rewarded with office the parties able to muster more <span class="highlight">votes</span> than their opponents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the difference between the value of city <span class="highlight">votes</span> and country <span class="highlight">votes</span> is the tiny margin that I have mentioned, the Parliament in 1965 was well justified, as I see it, in writing into the Act concern for electors living in divisions vaster than some of the largest nations of Europe, peopled by a thinly scattered population, remote from the great population centres of the Australian seaboard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The situation could arise in any election in this country in which, say, 2 parties were vying for <span class="highlight">votes</span> and where one party got 51 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> in every electorate and the other party got 49 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a matter of history that the amalgamation of the unions which now comprise the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union came about by the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of a mere handful of people and that the people who counted the <span class="highlight">votes</span> were involved with those who wanted the amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a sad reflection upon the paucity of business acumen in the Government and a sad reflection upon the degree of responsibility of an outfit masquerading as a government in Canberra today that the Caucus of this Government <span class="highlight">votes</span> to overturn the decision of a Cabinet and, quite contrary to the repeated declaration of the Reece Labor Government in Tasmania, seeks to drain Lake Pedder and regenerate the vegetation at a cost of up to $ 12m, followed by alternatives that will entail about $S0m in one case and $ 100m in the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But if the Opposition <span class="highlight">votes</span> to delay this Bill by some amendment and to put it over until the next year, that means it is deliberately saying ‘We are not prepared to consider any amendment of the existing legislation which we know to be unworkable and we are prepared, for whatever motive, to allow those practices to go on and to leave the consumer unprotected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the things that people forget, particularly the juvenile Press that we have about the country today, is that this Senate derives its constitution from the people of this country and it derives its election from the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the people of this country- the same people who elect members to the other chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apparently the reason for the slowness of the receipt of the figures by comparison with the rate of receipt at Federal elections is that for Federal elections full-time electoral officers are engaged in counting the <span class="highlight">votes</span> whereas for the New South Wales State elections part-time electoral officers are engaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the light of the promises given by  Mr Whitlam  and his cronies for the purpose of capturing <span class="highlight">votes</span> in order to gain office and receiving a report such as this which divorces the real benefits of our system from a significant section of the non-government school students, this Party would deserve to earn discredit if it did not fight to establish the principle that every child in this country is entitled to receive 100 per cent of the cost of his state school education if he wants it- and I took it- or, if he goes to an independent school, that he is entitled to such proportion of that expenditure as the Federal Government of the day decides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Government says to us that it will fight an election on the issue, I tell it that we will welcome an election on the issue of whether the promises that the Government made when it wanted <span class="highlight">votes</span> to win an election can be believed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Webster,  who would talk under water, stands here talking day after day, week after week, and then sends his statements to the provincial Press in the western district of Victoria, hoping that he will get enough <span class="highlight">votes</span> to send him back to this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the Labor Government should be strongly criticised for the attitude that it has adopted in this legislation which indicates that it discriminates in areas where it wants to discriminate but not in others where it thinks it can play up to the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of certain people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I did not hear all of  Senator Greenwood’s  remarks on this matter, but I have campaigned in quite a few Senate elections over the past few years and on each occasion I have heard the leaders of the Liberal Party and the Australian Country Party advocating <span class="highlight">votes</span> for the Liberal Party and the Country Party and the leaders of the Australian Democratic Labor Party advocating <span class="highlight">votes</span> for the DLP. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators opposite advocate <span class="highlight">votes</span> for their candidates when they are in government on the basis that they should also have a majority in the Senate to be able to govern, why would they argue that the elections for the Senate and House of Representatives should not be held at the same time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To win <span class="highlight">votes</span>  Mr Whitlam  said that the unfair freight rates imposed by overseas shipping companies and the inflation throughout Australia has resulted in a breakdown in the economic viability of many rural areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He finished up winning after the recount by some 200,000 <span class="highlight">votes</span>, which was a much as he was going to win by after the first count. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Any man who <span class="highlight">votes</span> against allowing the people to vote on the proposition which the elected Government wishes to put to them can hardly claim to be a democrat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to accept the argument put yesterday by the Government senators that we would be acting undemocratically in not allowing the proposal to go to the people then I ask this quesiton and I would like to hear the comments of Government senators on this proposition when they reply: If a Bill which would submit a proposal for an alteration of the Constitution to the people should pass through the Senate with a constitutional majority of 31 <span class="highlight">votes</span>, go to the House of Representatives, and be rejected and then, after an interval of 3 months, again be passed by the Senate with a Constitutional majority of 3 1 <span class="highlight">votes</span>, would the Government give an absolute undertaking that it would advise the Governor-General to submit that proposal to the people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear to me to be a departure that if we are not going to insist upon a vote by the majority of States to vary the Constitution but enable the referendum to be passed on an equality of State <span class="highlight">votes</span>, together with a majority of the aggregate of the people ‘s <span class="highlight">votes</span> it will be, to use my original term, a misconception of the very nature of the compact of federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Questions arising in the Senate shall be determined by a majority of <span class="highlight">votes</span>, and each senator shall have one vote . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Questions arising in the Senate shall be determined by a majority or <span class="highlight">votes</span>, and each senator shall have one vote . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You would have to say that the question has been carried by whatever the <span class="highlight">votes</span> were and then say that, in accordance with standing order 242, there not having been an absolute majority, the Bill is laid aside forthwith, and is not to be revived during the same session. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, attention has been called to section 23, which we have debated previously; but in accordance with rulings which prevail in this chamber, a decision as to the passage of a Bill or- let me be more precise- a decision on a question arising in this Senate shall be determined by a majority of <span class="highlight">votes</span>, each senator having one vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I submit that the  President  of the Senate should record the decision of the Senate as being that the Bill as amended was agreed to by a majority of 28 <span class="highlight">votes</span> to 23. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It states that any question that arises shall e determined by a majority of <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A a result of a physical division of the Senate in order that I could discern where the numbers lay and who was in favour of and who was against the motion, the tellers informed me that the <span class="highlight">votes</span> were ayes 28, noes 23. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And it was a successful frustration of the democratic process, for in the elections of 1950 the Liberal and Country Party team won a majority of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>, actually 49.7 per cent, but gained only 31 of the 75 seats, whereas Labor polled but 46.5 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> yet ‘managed to get 42 of the seats.  ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time Labor endeavoured to argue that preferential voting, which has served Australia very well, meant that people had 2 <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They argued that under preferential voting a person virtually had 2 <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means that the people resolve the difference between the 2 candidates who are left when those candidates who obtained a smaller number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> have been eliminated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An analysis of the British figures shows that Labour polled 37.2 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party in England polled 1 9.3 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the difference between 19 percent and 37 percent is the difference between 14 seats and 301 seats, enabling Labour at the moment to form a minority government when it does not have twice the number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> of a minority party which has only 14 seats in the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mere fact of it gaining more <span class="highlight">votes</span> meant that it took primary <span class="highlight">votes</span> from the 2 major parties, which ensured that one of the major parties would be faced with a situation of having to form a minority government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had a rundown on the figures prepared, and to my very great surprise I found that Labor got only 48 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>, yet it got 64 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, the Government Party at that time, the National Party, got 41 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> and only 37 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor with 48 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>, got 64 per cent of the seats and the other party, with 4 1 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>, got 37 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures I received from an official in the Library show that at the last election Labor with 49 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>, got 53 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal-Country Party got 41 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> and 46 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the factors that leaps to the eye is that in the last election the Liberal Party won 19 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> and gained 2 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other minor parties gained 24 seats from approximately 1,700,000 <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberals received more than 6 million <span class="highlight">votes</span> but only 14 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labour won S seats more than the Conservatives, while polling 0.9 per cent fewer <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But one thing is clear: The States and the State governments are ruman and they have a tendency to want to give up those powers and responsibilities which at any point of time are unpopular- those that are too costly, those that are difficult and those that they feel they could let the other fellow have without losing <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no <span class="highlight">votes</span> in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here, of course, there are additional safeguards because one has to get a majority of <span class="highlight">votes</span> in respect of the States so that four out of the six States, as well as a majority of voters, must approve the proposed change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Prowse and others joined with us and we successfully defeated the resolution in all States with the exception of New South Wales where the Yes vote won by a handful of <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that some leaders of State governments are prepared to sacrifice and to surrender any power which they think might cause them to lose <span class="highlight">votes</span>, instead of having the courage and determination to preserve the sovereignty of the States which they are charged to control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that he took any real part in the actions leading to an increase in interest rates, but I believe that the Prime Minister primarily understood what the Labor Party was quite deliberately doing, particularly to people with whom Labor had entered into a contract in the last election campaign in order to win their <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because one Party- the Australian Labor Party- recieved a very small surplus of seats and <span class="highlight">votes</span> at the last election, that does not mean that that Party should have a completely open go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rate of income for pensioners should be established by a tribunal independent of political boastings in this Parliament and independent of an atmosphere of bribing the pensioners, paying them more than someone else to get their <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It surprises me that the colleagues of the Country Party senator from Western Australia allied themselves with the Democratic Labor Party in what may be described as the national disaster alliance and lost <span class="highlight">votes</span> much more effectively than any other party in the whole of the election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-With a slightly reduced majority but overall- collectively so far as <span class="highlight">votes</span> throughout Australia are concerned- with a majority of <span class="highlight">votes</span> being cast by the Australian people in support of the policies and candidates of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was a product of precisely the same sort of perverted logic which compels the conservative parties to insist that an electoral system- such as that used in Western Australia and under which the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of some Western Australians have 15 times the value of other Western Australians- is democratic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It ought not to be forgotten that the Government was returned having lost 5 seats and having secured office by one seat which was won by 146 <span class="highlight">votes</span>, by another seat which was retained by only 147 <span class="highlight">votes</span> and by still another seat which was retained by only 163 <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But  Mr Daly’s  refusal to accept 52 per cent of the seats for less than 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> leads one to believe that he and his Party want more than 52 per cent of the seats for a similar or lesser vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I emphasise again that if the number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast for a candidate exceeds the aggregate vote of that candidate’s major opponents and he still loses the seat, how can it be said that the vote cast by a person in one electorate is reasonably on a par with that cast by a person in another electorate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All I am saying is that the Labor Party won the last 2 elections, and won them under an electoral system which it ought not to say is weighted against it, particularly since in neither case did the Labor Party secure 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even though we might have hopes that the Government could do better in the Australian Capital Territory, surely no one doubts that it is a very formidable task to expect any one party or group to win 66 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>, even in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would think that members of the Opposition would hang their heads in shame if they looked at the divisions and the way <span class="highlight">votes</span> were recorded in the House of Representatives in the period from when the Parliament assembled on 28 February 1973 to the end of 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The argument seems to be that by allowing the senators for the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory to have equal <span class="highlight">votes</span> with existing senators who claim to represent the States, the rights of those States would be reduced disproportionately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee feels constrained to say, however, that the one-firth margin on either side of the quota for a State which the Act allows may disturb quite seriously a principle which the Committee believes to be beyond question in the election of members of the national Parliament of a federation, namely, that the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the electors should, as far as possible, be accorded equal value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Such a possible disparity in the value of <span class="highlight">votes</span> is inconsistent with the full realisation of democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At least that is his official title; but he is generally known as the Minister for the conservation of a Labor government in office even with a minority of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the present system of redistribution, seats gained in Commonwealth parliamentary elections have reflected with sufficient accuracy the number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast for a party or groups of parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One need only remember that the Labor Party polled less than 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> in 1972 and again in 1974 but gained more than 50 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party wanted to give <span class="highlight">votes</span> to people under the voting age and to people who were not citizens by drawing up electorates on the basis of population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the Labor Party holds more seats in this House proportionally than the <span class="highlight">votes</span> it polled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party polled less than 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> yet it has more than 50 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basis of its argument in fact is that the Government believes that there can be manipulation in its favour to preserve it in office with under 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In local government in elections for city councils most people have no <span class="highlight">votes</span> and some have 8 <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the Labor Party won the election but not with a majority of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, its proportion of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> was reduced compared with the number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> it received in 1972, its representation in the House of Representatives was reduced, it did not get control of the Senate and it lost the 4 referendum questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No distribution should permit a situation where a party or a coalition of parties which secures a majority of <span class="highlight">votes</span> does not secure a majority of members in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The simple fact of life is that what the Australian Labor Party wants is 52 per cent of the parliamentary seats for about 45 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A political party like the Country Party which rarely receives more than about 10 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the Australian people has a disproportionate influence on the welfare of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at a few members of the Liberal Party I reckon that they have some dead <span class="highlight">votes</span> and that if there were more cemeteries in their electorates a few of them would not be here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party in that State won 5 seats with 46 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>, and the Liberal party won 5 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 18 May last the Country Party polled 10.7 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention the following matters in order to bring the situation up to date: In Queensland, for instance, the Australian Labor Party with 48 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>- more than the combined total of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of all the other parties- holds only 33 seats; yet the combined parties with 42 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> hold 47 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland it takes 13,045 <span class="highlight">votes</span> to elect a Labor member, 9,600 <span class="highlight">votes</span> to elect a Liberal member and 6,972 <span class="highlight">votes</span> to elect a Country Party member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer to the problem of representing country seats is not to weight the electorates for country members but to give them adequate facilities to carry out their responsibilities and to reach their electors and not by making country <span class="highlight">votes</span> worth more than city <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is that in 1954, 1961, 1969 and 1972, the Australian Labor Party obtained more <span class="highlight">votes</span> than were obtained by the parties of those who sit opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That principle is to ensure that every electorate shall have approximately the same number of electors, so that the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of all electors shall be equal in value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Leader of the Opposition has effectively pointed out, the real test of equitable electoral legislation is that the party which receives the majority of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> should also receive the majority of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time in respect of the House of Representatives the present Government polled 49.3 per cent of the formal <span class="highlight">votes</span> and received 5 1 .96 per cent of the seats in the new Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact when the vote is expressed as a ratio of the percentage of seats to the percentage of <span class="highlight">votes</span> the result slightly favours the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is on record in this Parliament as supporting the principle that all <span class="highlight">votes</span> should have equal value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact of the total <span class="highlight">votes</span> polled, the Australian Labor Party polled about 250,000 more than the combined <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the Liberal Party, the Country Party and the Democratic Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gladstone once said: ‘Do our opponents believe in counting <span class="highlight">votes</span> or weighing them?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is where one gets the weighing of <span class="highlight">votes</span> to suit a series of areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is absolutely no doubt that the Australian people want a system which gives equality of value of <span class="highlight">votes</span> for all voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it was assumed that, consistent with the constitutional requirement, there would be equality of value of <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast in elections for this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been argued in this Parliament in the past that there has never been an occasion when the party with the majority of <span class="highlight">votes</span> has not had the majority of seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1 972 the Australian Labor Party gained 49.59 per cent of the primary <span class="highlight">votes</span> and 41.48 per cent of the primary <span class="highlight">votes</span> went to the Liberal and Country Parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It took that proportion of the primary <span class="highlight">votes</span> to change the government and put the category A boys in their place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With one exception the party that got the majority of <span class="highlight">votes</span> formed the Government, and that is the real test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are the people of Australia to trust government of the future to a Country Party that can poll at best, say, 10 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> and demand 16 per cent of the seats? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The justification for the Senate was the preservation of State rights, not the destruction of <span class="highlight">votes</span> for city people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Admittedly, as a result of the double dissolution we did remove a splinter Party which supported the Liberal Party and the Australian Country Party through thick and thin but did not have enough <span class="highlight">votes</span> to have one person elected to the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the present situation, the Labor Party can poll 5 or 6 per cent or more of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> than the Opposition Parties but can only obtain a narrow majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts are that in 1972 the Australian Labor Party received 49.6 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> and 53.6 per cent of the seats and won Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact- the honourable members for Phillip  (Mr Riordan)  tried to ignore it but it is a simple fact- that the only redistribution that did not present the perfect result in terms of seats won for percentage of <span class="highlight">votes</span> won was the 1949 redistribution which was brought in by Labor itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that occasion the Labor Government tried to gerrymander the electorates and all the prima donnas wanted safe seats with a majority of about 20,000 <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the South Australian elections in 1968, when the Labor Party received almost 54 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> but were defeated in government, 20,000 people marched from the parade grounds in Adelaide to Light Square to demonstrate against the iniquitous electoral system that operated in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 9 elections held under  Sir Thomas  Playford ‘s Government, Labor won the majority of <span class="highlight">votes</span> in 8 elections but it never governed during that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It needed only 11 more <span class="highlight">votes</span> in one seat in that State, as my friend the honourable member for Stirling  (Mr Viner)  can confirm, and it would have won 60 per cent of the seats on 46 per cent of the State vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That principle is to ensure that every electorate shall have approximately the same number of electors, so that the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of all of the electors shall be equal in value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the reason lies in the means by which the Government expects that it can influence the <span class="highlight">votes</span>, to give it control of the Senate, in the representation from those Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1970- the figures would be greater now, of course- a person required almost 300,000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> to be elected as a senator in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Victoria he required almost 225,000 <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to be elected a senator for the Australian Capital Territory all that would have been required in 1973 was 28,000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> and to be elected a senator from the Northern Territory all that would have been required was 10,600 <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one examines the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory and considers the methods which have been adopted one can only believe that the intent of this Bill is to ensure that representation from both of those places ultimately will be secured for a Labor Government which, by the expenditure of money, buys <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is by this means that we have seen developing in this country the use of patronage in order to secure <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is patronage, that is corruption and that is the way in which <span class="highlight">votes</span> can be won and it was the way in which of course, prior to the English Reform Acts, <span class="highlight">votes</span> were won in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1972 the Liberal Party secured 26 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> and again the result would have been the same and members of the Labor Party know this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, I am confident, the belief of the Labor Party is that by the distribution of Government largesse and by the exercise of patronage the necessary <span class="highlight">votes</span> can be secured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can there be one vote one value when 28,000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the Northern Territory will elect one senator and 300,000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> are required to elect one senator in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a Bill which would give a disproportionate influence to the Territory senators so that they would have the deciding <span class="highlight">votes</span> in any issue on which, having regard to the equality of State representation, the major parties would be equally divided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each one of those State representatives is going to be prejudiced by the degree to which his voice is watered down by the addition to that chamber of additional <span class="highlight">votes</span> by persons who are not going to be in the same way concerned with these basic economic issues which only last week in this chamber have been shown to be of so little concern to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if honourable senators and members- even those few on the Government side who think sanely and sensibly about the implications of this legislation- genuinely believe that the statement of Edmund Burke that bad laws make for the worst form of government should not be seen to be repeated by the Government in this Parliament, they should cast their <span class="highlight">votes</span> against this measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone in this chamber will watch with interest the way in which the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  <span class="highlight">votes</span> on this measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the chamber will watch with interest how the honourable member for the Northern Territory <span class="highlight">votes</span> on this measure because he has consistently said that he supports Senate representation for the Northern Territory, but just as consistently he has voted with the Country Party against any measure which is designed to bring that about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the Parliament look with great pride to when this vote will be taken, because when the vote is taken we will see a majority of <span class="highlight">votes</span>- as is needed under the Constitution- in this Joint Sittingto give the people of the Northern Territory the just rights for which they have been fighting since 1911. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every member on this side of the House will be watching the performance of the honourable member for the Northern Territory to see which way he <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What members opposite are saying is that, so far as the Senate is concerned, 100,000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the ACTU should have no value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be recalled that when the motion for the second reading of the Bill was agreed to by the House of Representatives on 29 May 1973 it was carried by 78 <span class="highlight">votes</span> to 43 <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are members of the Opposition parties being so complimentary to us as to say that the Australian Labor Party will receive over twothirds of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> in each of those Territories and thus have its senators elected? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I put it to the Parliament that the Government cannot have it both ways, lt seems strange, putting it in the lowest possible key, to claim that these people would be full senators for the purposes of some sections of the Constitution- for example, section 22 and 23 relating to <span class="highlight">votes</span> and quorums in the Senate- but not in others, for example, section 24 relating to the nexus between the number of senators and the number of members in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that if these Bills are passed, as the march of numbers means they will be, it is certain that every man sitting on the Government side of the chamber who <span class="highlight">votes</span> for them will rue the day, because it is an absolute certainty that each generation will pass on its achievements or its failures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But he sits there and consorts with the Opposition and <span class="highlight">votes</span> for their socialist policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are all variations on a theme and they all come from the magnificent promise of freedom from cost and worry, mainly from politicians in order to curry favour and win <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite a remarkable thing that in the electorate of Kalgoorlie there was a tremendous swing in <span class="highlight">votes</span> against a man who was highly regarded in that area but who had one great burden to carry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the time the vital <span class="highlight">votes</span> on this Bill are taken it will be apparent, in view of the expressed attitude of the Liberal-Country Party Opposition to the Bill, whether party political ideology purportedly masked under the guise of self-professed independence will prevail or whether the interests of all Australians as consumers will be safeguarded by a joinder of certain forces with the Government to destroy the reactionary and conservative opposition to the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact of the matter is that if the -honourable senator peruses the estimates for my Department she will see that no <span class="highlight">votes</span> for grants are provided by the Treasury funds for my Department to make for that purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Country people are not able to have telephones installed because there are fewer <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Wright  has cast the wholly unwarranted aspersion that this Government has deliberately spent more on urban roads because there are more <span class="highlight">votes</span> in urban areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that there are more <span class="highlight">votes</span> in urban areas, but it is not true that this Government has allocated a higher percentage of the expenditure under this Bill vis-a-vis the previous Bill to urban areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it certainly was not a very sensible thing to do if it was trying to attract <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the urban areas by bribing them with a greater allocation of road funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In respect of each of these elections, the detailed list of candidates forfeiting deposits; candidates’ party affiliations; and first preference <span class="highlight">votes</span> polled is prefaced by a summary, consisting of a two-part breakdown analysis on a StatebyState andParty basis respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In respect of each of the four elections the detailed list of candidates forfeiting deposits, candidates’ party affiliations, and first preference <span class="highlight">votes</span> polled is prefaced by a Summary, consisting of a two-part break-down analysis of the number of candidates forfeiting deposits on a State-by-State and Party basis respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the rank and file meeting was finally held the decision to lift the ban was made by 20 <span class="highlight">votes</span> to 8 <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Eventually, amongst the small nations, Australia was able to muster enough <span class="highlight">votes</span> to enable  Dr Evatt  to be elected as the  President  of the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Willesee  has pointed out previously, the argument put up by the Opposition to the effect that  Senator Willesee  is bending towards certain countries with a view to gaining <span class="highlight">votes</span> is quite false because these countries are not entitled to cast a vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that  Senator Willesee  was looking for new friends so that he could get their <span class="highlight">votes</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the matter was put to the meeting  Mr Harding  lost the motion 64 <span class="highlight">votes</span> to 1. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suggestions were made that Australia would get <span class="highlight">votes</span> from the Soviet Union, other countries of the Soviet bloc or the developing countries in support of  Senator Willesee  ‘s candidature for  President  of the United Nations General Assembly in 1975 as a quid pro quo for the Australian Government’s de jure recognition of the incorporation of the Baltic republics into the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, the amalgamation is taken to be approved only where more than one-half of the members who record formal <span class="highlight">votes</span> vote in favour of the amalgamation, provided that ballot papers are received from at least one-half of the members on the roll of voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An amalgamation is now to be taken as approved if, in the ballot or each of the ballots if there is more than one, more than one-half of the members who duly record formal <span class="highlight">votes</span> in favour of the amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, both the Country Party and the Democratic Labor Party were represented by quite a number of senators in this place, in addition to which the Democratic Labor Party in its own right polled a significant number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> at the previous Senate election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They obtained a significant number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> in their own States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, the Austraiian Labor Party received approximately the same number of first preference <span class="highlight">votes</span> at the last general election after the double dissolution of the Parliament as the Liberal Party and the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We received approximately the same number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> as the Labor Party which is why we came back with the same number of senators as the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it is very difficult in mathematical terms, to work out the proportion of <span class="highlight">votes</span> received by each party in the other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though these 2 motions are the subject of a cognate debate I take it we will have separate <span class="highlight">votes</span> on each motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite clear that he wants to transform the Constitutional Convention into another senatorial chamber, because no <span class="highlight">votes</span> are taken at the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However it attempts to manipulate the figures, it did not get a majority of <span class="highlight">votes</span> in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Opposition senators have been talking a lot of nonsense and rubbish because Playford was the worst Premier that any State ever had because he controlled South Australia under a system in which his Party prevailed in government with a minority of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-We have heard a lot of nonsense from time to time from honourable senators opposite, even when they were in government, about outside interference and people being bound by <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They always forget that it is a traditional feature of our parliamentary party system that even Cabinet is bound by <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Which period is accepted will depend on the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the two independent senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It divided 4 <span class="highlight">votes</span> to 2, and the 4 <span class="highlight">votes</span> included my vote as a Liberal Party member of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But he did not seem very responsible when he said in Hobart some time ago, in effect, that he was not very interested in Tasmania because there were more <span class="highlight">votes</span> in Newcastle than there were in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that if the Opposition <span class="highlight">votes</span> against the Bill one puts beyond possible improvement the sort of industrial complexities which we have today when we should be aiming to solve many of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the occasion that I forced a vote on this issue, 15 November, believe it or not, my motion attracted 14 <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether I get 14 <span class="highlight">votes</span> on this occasion because of my advocacy or the couple I needed on a former occasion, I, as Leader of the Government in the Senate, will remain steadfast to the proposition that Camp Hill should be the site for parliament house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The total Protestant, Anglican and other <span class="highlight">votes</span> in favour of granting a divorce immediately or after an interval of 12 months was 71.8 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So when honourable senators cast their <span class="highlight">votes</span> they will be doing so completely, absolutely and utterly according to their own views and their own approach to the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Hall, as the representative of the Liberal Movement, was unable to secure nationally one per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is said that  Senator Steele  Hall on occasions <span class="highlight">votes</span> with the Labor Party, which he does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it can be said that because  Senator Steele  Hall sometimes <span class="highlight">votes</span> with the Labor Party, which he does, that makes him in some way not a member of the Opposition, what can be said about the DLPthe Party that kept the Liberal and Country Parties in office for 17 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, expressed as <span class="highlight">votes</span> by individual senators, this represents 11,571 occasions on which the 29 members of the Liberal-Country Party Opposition have not opposed the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to find the number of occasions on which the LiberalCountry Party Opposition has voted for the Government, one has to multiply the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the 29 Liberal-Country Party senators by the number of Bills by the number of procedural matters which are decided by vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It can be- the allegation is certainly madethat it is a method of patronage and support for the Australian Labor Party because the persons in this western region commission who have had the sponsoring of the organisation are essentially there in order to ensure that by the use of money judiciously dispensed the Labor Party can secure <span class="highlight">votes</span> for itself in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These include: optional preferential marking of ballot papers; printing of party affiliations of candidates on ballot papers; registration of political parties for purposes of indentification and printing of affiliations on ballot papers; introduction of mobile polling booths at hospitals and similar institutions; drawing for positions of candidates on House of Representatives ballot papers; closing of the polls at 6 p.m. rather than 8 p.m.; requiring a candidate changing his name within 12 months prior to nominations to declare the change, and providing for the former name to be included on the ballot paper; prevention of persons enrolling or nominating for election under changed names in certain circumstances; an earlier deadline for the return of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> and for the return of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> direct to respective Returning Officer; restricting postal vote application forms to be used at an election or referendum to those specified by notice in the Gazette; prohibiting the listing of names of persons who apply for postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>, except in certain specified circumstances; providing postal voting facilities for prisoners who have retained their franchise entitlements; increasing the amount of deposit required with nomination and varying the conditions under which deposits may be saved; preservation of the voting entitlement of Australian citizens posted overseas in the service of the Crown, and retention on the roll of the name of an elector temporarily absent from his address; precluding nomination for election to the Australian Parliament of a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory or the Australian Capital Territory; prevention of a person from nominating as a candidate for more than one Federal election held on the same day; protection of candidates against the issue of misleading how-to-vote cards; change in qualifications for enrolment, voting and candidature from ‘British Subject’ to status of a British Subject’; eliminating the need to state the address of author in the case of broadcasting or telecasting of political matters; the manner of announcing the name of an author of political matter on radio or television; responsibility for publication of matter or comment of a political nature in the Press between issue of the writ and the close of the poll; removal of the restriction on exhibition of electoral posters within a hall or room being used for political party meetings; provision of support staff for Distribution Commissioners; authority for alterations to the roll when a street is renamed or renumbered; lowering the permissible age of Presiding Officers or Assistant Presiding Officers to 18 years; appointment of substitute Assistant Returning Officer at places outside Australia in certain circumstances; increases in penalties for failure to enrol; the provision of fines as an alternative to imprisonment where relevant; amounts of monetary penalties to match imprisonment terms; amendment of questions to be put to voters by Presiding Officers; conversion of distances to metric measurements; use of ‘given names’ in lieu of ‘Christian names’: candidates making gifts, donations etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it is proposed that an earlier deadline be fixed for the return of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it is proposed that postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> be returned direct to the relevant Returning Officer, by the elector or his agent, rather than through an Assistant Returning Officer, some other Returning Officer or a Presiding Officer as allowed under the existing law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present, a period of 10 days’ grace after polling day is allowed for the receipt of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> by the relevant Returning Officer, of <span class="highlight">votes</span> posted direct to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, under the proportional representation system used for the Senate, the quota for an election cannot be determined, nor can the count commence, until the exact number of formal <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast is known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the recent Senate elections, the precise number of formal <span class="highlight">votes</span> was unknown until over 2 weeks after polling day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the proposed introduction of optional preferential marking of ballot papers will speed up the counting process, especially for the Senate, this advantage would be largely lost if it remains necessary to wait for postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> for up to 10 days after polling day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore proposed that postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> be returned so as to reach the appropriate Returning Officer not later than the close of the poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as can be ascertained, no other country allows the admission of <span class="highlight">votes</span> returned after polling day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill also makes provision for <span class="highlight">votes</span> to be recorded at specially designated hospitals and institutions before polling day itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Government is particularly anxious to prevent unscrupulous persons taking advantage of aged or infirm electors, it is also proposed to prohibit the inspection of postal vote applications for the purpose of listing of names of persons who applied for postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> at an election, except where such listing is genuinely required in connection with an inquiry into possible malpractices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to prevent any possible misunderstanding, I must stress that people who, because of their religious beliefs, are precluded from voting during certain hours will retain the right to apply for postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But so that it can be fully understood it is necessary, I believe, to analyse what the Committee has already determined that the law should be, because of <span class="highlight">votes</span> earlier this afternoon the Committee has established the Family Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently the group’s deliberations and the manner in which <span class="highlight">votes</span> are taken are not a matter of public record from which I can indicate how  Mr Grenville  might have voted on the resolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-82-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could have the arguments now and then take the <span class="highlight">votes</span>, one after the other without further argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee has decided by its earlier <span class="highlight">votes</span> that the ground for divorce should be one year’s separation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is any delay in the counting of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>, a lot of it must lie at the foot of the postal system rather than at the foot of the electoral system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One may say that we are also somewhat suspicious politically in regard to this proposal because it is a statistical fact that certainly over the last 20 years postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> have favoured my side of politics, not the Government side of politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to the percentage of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> for this place sometimes, perhaps we should have symbols too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another argument put by the Government is that optional preferential voting will reduce the number of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, in the election for the House of Representatives this year the informal vote was only 1.92 percent of the total <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, since 1900 the percentage of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> for House of Representatives elections has hardly moved, up or down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the Government’s argument on informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> for House of Representatives elections, I do not think that has much validity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turning to Senate elections, if one uses the argument that optional preferential voting will reduce the percentage of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span>, I do not know how the Government can attempt to substantiate it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe it is valid to take the results of an electorate here, an electorate there and an electorate somewhere else and talk about the percentage of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> within the electorate generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What one must do is look at the informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast in Australia because, after all, we are talking about a Bill for an Act which will affect all electors in Australia in elections for the whole of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>might have the effect of continuing to produce a fairly high informal vote, it definitely precludes the possibly greater evil of exhausted <span class="highlight">votes</span>- that is, <span class="highlight">votes</span> which become exhausted in the process of transfer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>one result of a system that does not require electors to vote for all candidates whose names appear in the ballot paper is that a candidate may be declared elected although the total number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> credited to him falls short  or  the required quota. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the parliamentary election in New South Wales in 1922 and 1925, the exhausted <span class="highlight">votes</span>, which far outnumber the informal <span class="highlight">votes</span>, were the cause of much dissatisfaction and disputation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is sometimes stated that if we introduce optional preferential voting for the Senate we may reduce the number of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find that during that time a percentage of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> between 4 per cent and 9 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly is not any significant reduction in the rate of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not going to enter into the detailed arguments about what is being done to alter the right to cast postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can recall many malpractices occurring in order to secure <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have in mind the present Labor Government in the United Kingdom which is in office after having polled 37 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This system was tried, as  Senator Wood  said, in Queensland in the 1930s and when it last operated there, in 1941, 1 notice that with something like 5 1 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> the government of that day was elected with 66 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had this sort of system prevailed for the last Federal election in Australia 49 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> would have won 58 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that came from the 1974 election was that with 49 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> the Labor Party became the Government, having won 51 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is possible, of course, that there happens to be a State election campaign and that my beloved friend, the Premier, with whom I converse regularly- I will not refer to him religiously tonight; he has over the last few weeks done a lot to lose that title- would adopt this sort of tinny gimmick which he would think would probably gather <span class="highlight">votes</span> for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was up in the Torres Strait Islands just last week buying <span class="highlight">votes</span> for the Australian Labor Party in Queensland by handing out money to the councils for the Torres Strait islanders as though it was going out of style. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was been Minister for Aboriginal Affairs for almost 18 months, but 2 weeks before an election he goes to Queensland and starts tossing money around so that he can buy some <span class="highlight">votes</span> from the Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will recall that on Thursday 28 November last  Senator Bonner  accused him of buying <span class="highlight">votes</span> for the Australian Labor Party in Queensland by handing out money to the councils for the Torres Strait Islanders as though it was going out of style. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can he also inform the Senate whether  Senator Bonner  has ever sought financial assistance from him to be used for the welfare of the Aboriginal people in Queensland and, if so, did he consider that by agreeing to any such requests he might be leaving himself open to being accused by  Senator Bonner  of attempting to buy <span class="highlight">votes</span> for the Australian Labor Party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether I would be accused of trying to buy <span class="highlight">votes</span> by acceding to  Senator Bonner’s  request never entered my head, nor did it enter my head that such an accusation would be made in the Torres Strait Islands where I was trying to improve the conditions of Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that everything the Government does which is of benefit to someone could be alleged to be buying <span class="highlight">votes</span>, but the Government- through my portfolio in particularhas a responsibility to advance the conditions of Aborigines and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I remind him that the measure we were debating last week was not in the <span class="highlight">votes</span> or any of the clauses of a Government measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the areas of these Ministers money is used for purposes which the Labor Party regards as desirable and it is hoped thereby to buy <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The improvements we have made in the industrial field are said to be things we have done because we want to get <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that in all the <span class="highlight">votes</span> that have been taken on this tonight I could have remained out of the chamber and the results would have been the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that  Senator Wood  is no admirer of the Prime Minister of this country, but he is Prime Minister because of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the people of Australia, twice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia or even of Queensland take such comfort, from a situation where a coalition with S8.7 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> gets 69 seats and the Australian Labor Party with 36.3 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> gets only 1 1 seats? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has assumed financial responsibility for these people, so let the Federal Government pay the right price for their <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Talking of electorates I am reminded of the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones),  the honourable member for Newcastle, who made a famous statement which appealed to Tasmanians no end, that there were more <span class="highlight">votes</span> in Newcastle than there were in Tasmania, so why worry about Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would think that all honourable senators can be assured that had any undercover members of the Labor Party been present in the ranks of the Liberal Party their <span class="highlight">votes</span> would have been cast in favour of retaining  Mr Snedden  as Leader. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It would have been an impossible state of affairs if, having secured over one-third- 36 per cent- of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>, the Labor Party had ended up with only one or two seats in a House of 82 members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me say, more for the benefit of the public than for the benefit of the members of this Committee of the whole, that the debate which is taking place is a free debate and the <span class="highlight">votes</span> which are to be taken are free <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They would call for a division knowing that the result of it would be 55 <span class="highlight">votes</span> to 5 <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But such senators called for a division because they wanted their <span class="highlight">votes</span> recorded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The basic principle of proportional representation is that <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast for each party should be reflected in seats won by that party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to give expression to this principle, it is necessary that in the filling of a casual vacancy, the representation of the parties should remain a reflection of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast for those parties at the previous election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On that occasion, the Australian Labor Party candidates polled 200 000 first preference <span class="highlight">votes</span> more than their LiberalCountry Party opponents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Murphy, received some 200 000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> over and above the Liberal and Country Party candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, at the last election in New South Wales the Labor movement secured a majority of <span class="highlight">votes</span> over and above the Liberal-Country Party candidates in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, and it is only 7 months ago that the people of New South Wales expressed that point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that a mere 7 months before the people of New South Wales by their <span class="highlight">votes</span> had elected  Mr Murphy  and other Labor candidates to this Senate,  Mr Lewis  is now cutting across the expressed wish of the people of New South Wales and determining to rip up that convention and that vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liberals are frightened to speak because they are bound by strict Party <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators here are trying to say that no <span class="highlight">votes</span> are taken in the Liberal Party room, that they are not held to <span class="highlight">votes</span>, let them get up and say so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the defects of proportional representation and the transfer of <span class="highlight">votes</span> from the original papers is that if there is an election in 1974 and the casual vacancy occurs in 1975 a great deal of change in the political judgment of the electors may have occurred in that interval. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if it is found that the Constitution is in line with the general theme that the Senate is a body in which the States have a particular interest and that the Constitution prescribes that the members of both Houses of the State Parliament sitting together shall fill a casual vacancy, it can be seen that it may be that a decision by the people’s representatives in the State Parliament would be a more appropriate interpretation of the will ofthe people in February 1975 than a transfer of <span class="highlight">votes</span> from an election held in May 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most satisfactory way to ensure this result, the Committee considered, was by a provision in the law that any <span class="highlight">votes</span> credited to an ex-senator be transferred to the next in line according to his ballot papers and the candidate elected by a continuation of the count would serve until the expiration of the term or until the election of a successor at the next election, whichever should first occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As reported in the Constitutional Review Committee’s report the Committee found it impossible to devise a provision which would allow for the transmission of <span class="highlight">votes</span> according to party nomination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the States concede their constitutional power to fill a casual vacancy they could refer that power to the Parliament of the Commonwealth and enable the Commonwealth, having got rid of section 15, to go on and add to the present truncated proportional representation provisions, those provisions that would enable casual vacancies to be filled in accordance with those principles by a transfer and a recount of <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, is this a precedent which will be followed in relation to victims of any natural disaster which happens before Parliament debates and <span class="highlight">votes</span> on the National Compensation Bill? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Early in this situation I was asked- accused really- by  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack whether we were canvassing <span class="highlight">votes</span> from the Third World group, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out then that this was quite ridiculous because the Third World group does not have <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be a little like Malcolm Fraser in his bid for the leadership of the Liberal Party canvassing <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposed law received a majority of yes <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the most populous State, New South Wales, and was only narrowly lost in Victoria and South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government imagines that by putting up the deposits required or the percentage of <span class="highlight">votes</span> required is going to overcome this problem it has another think coming because it will not achieve what it attempts to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I shouted for the bar- that was not canvassing <span class="highlight">votes</span>, so they tell me in western countryand the honourable member was able to partake of the refreshments provided by me on that occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a mockery to say that the average man’s vote equals the millionaire s  vote, so long as the millionaire’s vote can be supplemented with a $100,000 contribution to buy television time that will influence thousands of other <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On that occasion 49.3 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> gave this Government 5 1.2 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Moreover the new provisions provide for an amalgamation to be taken as having been approved if in the ballot or each of the ballots, if there is more than one ballot, more than one half of the members who recorded formal <span class="highlight">votes</span> are in favour of the amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I am saying to  Senator Wright  is that if he <span class="highlight">votes</span> against the second reading he is precluding the alteration of the Bill in this fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-We received more <span class="highlight">votes</span> throughout the Commonwealth for the Senate than for the other place and, strangely, the Labor Party received less <span class="highlight">votes</span> for its Senate candidates than it did for its House of Representatives candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The promise of open government- a promise that it thought would win <span class="highlight">votes</span>- has proved as phoney as its other election promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will not follow the <span class="highlight">votes</span> through, because I have already explained them in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition believes in a fair and equitable electoral system, one in which the party with the most <span class="highlight">votes</span> wins the most seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We always collect enough <span class="highlight">votes</span> to keep our deposit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party has tried to disguise the fact that this Bill would effectively deprive many people of a postal vote, without offering them any other way of having their <span class="highlight">votes</span> counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition takes this basic stance: If voting is to be compulsory electors should be given every possible opportunity to have their <span class="highlight">votes</span> counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the specious excuse of avoiding delays in counting election results, the Government would insist that all postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> be received by the close of the poll if they are to be counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are few occasions when counting of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> materially delays the outcome of an election; but if it does, surely these <span class="highlight">votes</span> are vital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will be proposing that for each election a different coloured postal vote form be used, ensuring no party can store up forms and then solicit <span class="highlight">votes</span> with these forms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Donkey <span class="highlight">votes</span> come about because people do not understand the system and do not understand how it works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One can imagine being a polling clerk at a small booth where one can expect only 40 <span class="highlight">votes</span> in all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the last Federal election less than one year ago, 5 1 per cent of the seats in the House of Representatives were gained by the Australian Labor Party with 49 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Postal voting, it is suggested in this Bill, should be such that no <span class="highlight">votes</span> will be counted that are not received by the closing of the polls on the Saturday, if that be the day of the election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that the period of 10 days which has been the normal time outside which it is not allowable for such <span class="highlight">votes</span> to be received is to be changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to labour this particular point, but I do want to suggest that hundreds of thousands of Australians are not in the spectator group of the community and do in fact enjoy playing bowls, cricket, football, golf or whatever, and to these people, I say quite seriously, this is an option that is being taken away from them- the option of coming back after 6 p.m. and having until 8 p.m. to register their <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the question of the cut-off time for <span class="highlight">votes</span> after an election, if there is to be some malpractice or some honest misunderstanding with regard to the <span class="highlight">votes</span> in transit, that will certainly happen in those 10 days after an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we were to apply to a postal ballot for a trade union election the safeguards that exist for postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> in our electoral system of the moment, there could be resorts to all kinds of rorts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not say that postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> are the be all and end all ingredients of victory in an election where the results are very close. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were some misgivings on the part of the Labor Party at the number of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> which seemed to indicate a manifestation of Party loyalty out of all proportion to the trend of voting in metropolitan Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suppose the Opposition was to say to us:  We do not like your idea of having a cut-off time for postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unquestionably, the facts have shown that there is a preponderance of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> which go to the Opposition and which during the later counting, in some cases, tend to swing seats towards the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I had a pretty high level crew at that time, and each one of them and the others who joined me on those many occasions would agree with me when I say that many of the proposals incorporated in this Bill are those which used to be indicated to us by people coming to cast their <span class="highlight">votes</span> and encountering some of the difficulties and problems associated with the casting of <span class="highlight">votes</span> and who observed very strongly to us that it was time the electoral laws of this country were brought up to date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I come now to the rather vexed question of the earlier deadline for the receipt of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I can do no better in my observations on this point than to indicate to the Senate that research around the world has led to the conclusion that we are the only country which allows postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> to be received after the time of closing of the polls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The order of election of senators is based upon the obtaining of a quota, and that quota cannot be determined until all the <span class="highlight">votes</span> are in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that on the basis of reason there ought to be a concession which will allow the lodgment of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> before but not later than the close of the polls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we are a democracy catering for everybody and everybody should have an equal opportunity of recording their vote as do the great bulk of the people- by going along to a polling booth and recording their <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know it is quite easy to say we should cut down the hours for voting but, when all is said and done, as a democracy our aims should be to get every vote possible and therefore whilst it might take a couple of hours longer than some people want I think that in the main the extra <span class="highlight">votes</span> that come in really suit the true democratic purpose of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to preferential voting, here again I know that it is very easy to say: ‘Why force people to give preference <span class="highlight">votes</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> will occur at any time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether the system is a straight-out first past the post system, whether it is an optional preference system or whether it is a compulsory preference system, informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> will still be cast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> must be received within 10 days after the close of the poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore we should cast the net widely and make the voting system elastic so that notwithstanding the faults of the voters we get as many <span class="highlight">votes</span> as possible, and that when the election result is announced it is what the people of the country really intend- a government of their choice elected to govern this country for the following 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they cannot get an absentee vote, their <span class="highlight">votes</span> are lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must get the most <span class="highlight">votes</span> possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To get the correct decision for the government of the country for the ensuing term we should make the recording of <span class="highlight">votes</span> as easy as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this system has lent itself to the manipulation of <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are well aware of the actions of one gentleman who immediately after an election is held begins compiling applications for postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> for the next election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He was first off the mark and had an advantage over others from his activities in helping people to apply for postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another reform is the prohibiting of the listing of names of persons who apply for postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>, except in certain specified circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But for the alertness of Liberal Party scrutineers the Labor Party would have won 60 per cent of the seats in my State of Western Australia with only 46 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What  Senator Withers  was trying to imply was that this Government under  Mr Daly,  the Minister responsible, had by some manner or means instructed the electoral officers to manipulate the <span class="highlight">votes</span> in that electorate so that the candidate from  Senator Withers’  Party,  Mr Viner,  would not win the seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It needs a safe result in which the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of all electors are considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It needs a result in which the people, by their <span class="highlight">votes</span>, say who they do not want to be elected as well as who they do want to be elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate once again that with the present system the political party gaining the majority of <span class="highlight">votes</span> in Australia can form a government because it will obtain the majority of seats in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people are not impressed by any argument that counting of <span class="highlight">votes</span> can commence 2 hours earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the polls close at 6 p.m., I have been informed by the Bureau of Meteorology that for some 27 weeks of the year -more than 6 months of the year- 6 p.m. will be before sunset and people of these 2 religious faiths will be prevented from personally attending the polling places and casting their own <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is any delay in processing the application for the <span class="highlight">votes</span> or in returning the <span class="highlight">votes</span> then electoral justice is lessened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, under this Bill the Government has decided that it is going to set an earlier deadline for the return of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> and it will insist upon their being returned direct to the respective returning officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An earlier deadline for the return of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> has no justification except that it will lead to this more rapid result which is seen by the Labor Party as such a valuable aim in itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any kind of postal delay, any kind of bureaucratic failure, any delay in delivering postal vote application forms, any overloading of a divisional returning office with work could result in the disfranchisement of those seeking postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that full preferential voting in a Senate election ensures that there are sufficient <span class="highlight">votes</span> remaining late in the count and available to elect the proper number of senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst this latter requirement may have the effect of continuing to produce a fairly high informal vote it definitely precludes the possibly greater evil of exhausted <span class="highlight">votes</span>, that is, <span class="highlight">votes</span> which become exhausted in the process of transfer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this connection it is pointed out that at the 1922 and 1925 parliamentary elections in New South Wales the exhausted <span class="highlight">votes</span>, which in number exceeded the informal <span class="highlight">votes</span>, were the cause of much dissatisfaction and disputation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have in this country electoral history which tells us that exhausted <span class="highlight">votes</span> do occur and that they can complicate the correct decision about who has been elected and who has not, and they can be the cause of much dissatisfaction and disputation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing in the search for speedier results justifies taking away the rights of citizens to vote and to have their <span class="highlight">votes</span> counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition apparently believes that the present system, which particularly in Senate elections gives rise to an average of about 10 per cent informal <span class="highlight">votes</span>, should be retained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition would preserve this high rate of informal vote while the Government ‘s aim is to ensure that the percentage of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> is reduced and that people whose intentions are clear are afforded the maximum opportunity to have those intentions translated into a valid vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again this question boils down to striking a balance between the necessity to give members of the public a reasonable opportunity to place their <span class="highlight">votes</span> and the burdens placed on the polling officers because of counting procedures and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 wish to refer to the question of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Before the Committee <span class="highlight">votes</span> on this question I think <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only people who will lose that deposit and will be penalised are those who poll a very low number of <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the necessary provisions for the Government if it is to limit the capacity of people to lodge postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus it appears that the Opposition proposes to add a system of automatic issuing of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> to persons in the larger country divisions who register as general postal voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the existing postal voting arrangements, applications for postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> may be made after the tenth day prior to the issue of the writ, thus allowing generally about 6 weeks before polling day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as  Senator Sir Kenneth  Anderson’s argument is concerned, true it is I said that under the existing postal voting arrangements applications for postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> may be made after the tenth day prior to the issue of the writ, thus allowing, generally speaking, a period of about 6 weeks before the actual polling date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are local returning officers and divisional officers to which people may apply and get their postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> very quickly indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This clause is intended to prevent persons from inspecting lists of those people who apply for postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is opposing clause 29 which deals with inspecting applications for postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> at divisional offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time section 89 (3) of the Act provides that all applications for postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> shall be open for public inspection at all convenient times during office hours from and including the third day after polling day until the election can be no longer questioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been found that this entitlement has been misused by certain persons who list the names of electors who recorded postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> and retain such a list until just prior to the next election, when postal vote applications are forwarded to those electors without really knowing whether they are still entitled or desire to vote by post. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of this clause, if inserted, would be that postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> would have to be delivered or posted direct to the relevant divisional returning officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 30 and I think clauses 31 and 32, relate to postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A 10-day period for the return of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> to the divisional returning officer for the division concerned would be retained and electors would continue to be able to transmit their postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> to another divisional returning officer, to an assistant returning officer or to a presiding officer, and provided one of those officers receives the envelope containing the vote before the close of the poll, the divisional returning officer for the division concerned must await its receipt for inclusion in the scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that  Senator Douglas  McClelland said that the fate of a government may depend on these <span class="highlight">votes</span> is all the more reason that they ought to be counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An inference to be drawn from his remarks- I hope I am not doing him an injustice because I admire him too much as a person- is that it is far better to determine the fate of a government by not counting all the <span class="highlight">votes</span> than determining it by counting all the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should continue to accept their <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 32 deals with postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> and seeks to amend section 96 of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides that the divisional returning officer shall admit to the scrutiny only those envelopes containing postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> received by him up to the close of the poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This again is related to the Government’s proposal that postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> should be returned direct to the divisional returning officer for the division concerned and be received by him by the close of the poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people might have voted that way deliberately and, if people deliberately vote from the top to the bottom of the ballot paper, I think it is a bit of ruddy cheek for members of political parties to say that they are donkeys or that they have cast donkey <span class="highlight">votes</span> and that they do not know what they are doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he wishes to write some biblical quotation across it, if he wishes to pass comments on the candidates whose names appear on it- many informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> result from that practice- or if he wishes to do nothing with the ballot paper, that is his business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Withers  knows that political scientists can substantiate claims that a certain percentage of <span class="highlight">votes</span> at an election goes to the candidate whose name is first on the list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was always interesting to observe that in comparable electorates like Barton and St George the DLP candidate in one of the electorates whose name started with ‘A’ received about 2 per cent more <span class="highlight">votes</span> than the DLP candidate in the other electorate whose name started with ‘R’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, there is a simple solution to that problem, and that is for them to apply for postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have made arrangements for postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> when an election is held in hours when they cannot attend in person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So  Senator Baume  cannot say that the people of his faith or of the Seventh Day Adventist faith will be disenfranchised if polling closes at 6 p.m. because it is quite in order for them to have postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> would be required only when elections are held in the time of the year when daylight hours are longer and the sun sets after 6 p.m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not as  Senator Withers  would say and as he has said- that the returning officer should engage another group of people to count the <span class="highlight">votes</span> after the booth closes at 8 ‘clock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also pointed out that, even though there is a difference between polling hours in a Federal poll and a State poll in Queensland, there have not been fewer <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast in State elections than in Federal elections; so he has completely answered that argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this democracy, everybody should have an equal right in the recording of <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-We on this side of the chamber are being accused of trying to deny people <span class="highlight">votes</span> because we decided that we would like to have 6 o’clock closing at polling booths. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is done to stop the workers from casting their <span class="highlight">votes</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people concerned have been able to vote at elections by vitue of their right to cast postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We can say, in effect, that we will keep the booths open for 24 hours because certain people in our community must go along and get postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> as they cannot vote within the 12 hours that are allocated to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 do not believe that the suggestion that there be made available to these people literally thousands more postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> is a suitable solution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s view is that polling hours from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., together with the absentee and postal voting facilities, provide ample opportunities for persons to record their <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Consequently, the progressive results of the counting of the first preference <span class="highlight">votes</span> for which the nation is waiting will be known much earlier on the night of polling day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If any person so elected and returned contrary to the provisions of this Part sits or <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the Council, he shall be l iable to a penalty of Two hundred pounds to be recovered by any person who sues for the same in any court of competent jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That, unless otherwise ordered, the <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the Schedule be considered in the same groupings and order as in Estimates Committees A, B, C, D, E, F and G respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the amendment moved by  Senator Withers  is carried the staff at hospitals will be asked to stay on duty for those extra hours to cope with <span class="highlight">votes</span> which in my opinion will probably already have been cast because the people in charge of the mobile polling booths will ensure that the <span class="highlight">votes</span> are cast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 123 ( 1) (a) of the principal Act states that when an elector has a ballot paper for a Senate election he shall place the number 1 in the square opposite the name of the candidate for whom he <span class="highlight">votes</span> as his first preference, and shall place the numbers, 2, 3, 4 and so on as the case requires in the squares opposite the names of all the remaining candidates so as to indicate the order of his preference for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument is that in that election the number of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> was excessive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will quote to honourable senators the number of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast at various elections since proportional representation was introduced in 1949. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a lot of interesting folk law in regard to informal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It saw a fall in the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of both the major parties which were then in government and in Opposition and quite an unusual rise in the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the minor parties and the Independents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could extend that argument and say that there are too many informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> which are not counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are the major parties to be elected to office or sent into opposition on the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the least intelligent in the communitythose who need mark the ballot paper with only the number 1 in a House of Representatives election and with the numbers 1 to 5 when voting in a Senate election? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether any real evidence has been produced as to the cause of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not attempt to put a percentage on the number, but I believe that quite a number of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> are deliberately informal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there is the other informal vote- the person who <span class="highlight">votes</span> 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, and 5 because he becomes confused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think there is any real evidence as to what causes the informal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it quite frankly that optional preferential voting in a proportional voting system is slower to count than a full preferential voting system because when the quotas have been fixed one must make certain how one takes out the exhausted <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not speed up the poll, nor will it reduce the number of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we would have had a lot more formal <span class="highlight">votes</span> if the people who were compelled to go to the polls had to vote only for the number of candidates required to fill the vacant positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have taken out some figures of the informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> at the Senate election in May last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total number of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> for the whole of Australia was 788 126. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am indebted to  Senator McLaren  who told us that it will reduce the number of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the Labor case to have any validity the Government must be able to show us an example where a voting alteration has led to an alteration in the result- a smaller number of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the results that have been obtained around Australia it appears that it is not the number of candidates or the exhaustive preferential system which affects the rate of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proper casting of <span class="highlight">votes</span> is a road to power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What does the Government intend to do to overcome the problem of exhausted <span class="highlight">votes</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the Minister will agree that wherever optional preferential voting has been used and wherever there has been a quota for the election of senators- even going back to the New South Wales experience in the 1920s- exhausted <span class="highlight">votes</span> have meant that quotas could no longer be met for the later candidates to be elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government’s plan is to cope with the problem of exhausted <span class="highlight">votes</span> and inadequately filled quotas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It produces circumstances such as those in Great Britain in which 36 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> provided a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The optional preferential system was tried in Queensland once upon a time and on that occasion, if my memory serves me correctly, approximately 5 1 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> produced 66 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us assume that candidate A receives 45 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>, candidate B receives 30 per cent and candidate C receives 25 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was ultimately won by the Country Party which gained just over 30 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least it is fairly clear that there is a correlation between the number of candidates and the number of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am surprised it has not occurred to members of the Opposition that one of the reasons for introducing an optional preferential system is that people will still be able to record a valid vote without being compelled to number their preferences all the way down to number 73 and to record quite meaningless <span class="highlight">votes</span> or be forced to record quite meaningless preferences when they have no real preference at all between candidates No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we should endeavour to make formal as many <span class="highlight">votes</span> as possible and I believe that the Government’s move will have the effect of making more <span class="highlight">votes</span> formal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, the Government’s argument is that, because of the high number of candidates, under the optional preference system where one <span class="highlight">votes</span> only from one to five the amount of the informal vote will fall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that a reduction in informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> has been the Government’s principal argument for the introduction of preferential voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Baume  made great play of the fact that, in relation to informal <span class="highlight">votes</span>, although there had been 74 candidates on one occasion, there had been previous years when the number of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> was higher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a very vigorous campaign conducted by the Electoral Office and I think that campaign held down the figure for informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> to 12 per cent or so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the Committee, in all fairness, that it must be faster to check the tens of thousands of <span class="highlight">votes</span> in New South Wales by checking from one to five than it is to check from one to seventy-four- and there is no guarantee that the number of candidates will be held down to seventy-four, in view of the amendments that the Opposition has thrown out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would be the same sort of atmosphere in the States other than New South Wales, where there was a high publicity drive which did hold down the informal vote to 12.3 per cent; but even in that State there is a correlation between the number of candidates and the informal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In New South Wales there were 1 9 Senate candidates and the percentage of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> was 10.08 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Examples would be optional preferential voting, Party affiliations on ballot papers and an earlier close off time for the receipt of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately there is often in public men a timidity that they may offend someone, may lose some <span class="highlight">votes</span> here or may do something else, but so far as I am concerned it is a case of making a decision on whether it is right or wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no automatic relationship between the total <span class="highlight">votes</span>, but there is an automatic relationship between the appropriations provided in the Advance to the Treasurer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This point is worth stressing, given the frequent assertions which have been made by Country Party spokesmen to the effect that the percentage of seats won by the Government and Opposition in recent elections has accurately reflected the number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> polled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, at the 1972 House of Representatives elections the Country Party polled 9.44 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>, yet was able to win 16 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have pointed out previously, with less than 50 per cent of the first preference <span class="highlight">votes</span> the Government was able to win office in 1972 and to retain office in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What will alter the balance between the parties is that one party or the other will gain a far greater percentage of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> than it gained on the last occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He substantiated his argument by a most peculiar thesis which is that as long as the result overall in Australia produces a percentage of <span class="highlight">votes</span> for a party in accordance with the general overall Australian content of Liberal Party, Labor Party, National Country Party or other voters, it is a just scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was highlighted by our opponents of the then Liberal Country League which represents the view of  Senator Withers  that there should not be electoral equality between the country and the city and that some additional weighting and value ought to be given to country <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reiterate that it was one of the most intensive campaigns that South Australia has seen and the party standing for one vote one value received 46 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the first count and the then Liberal Country League received 29 per cent of the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is opposed on those grounds by a number of sitting members in Tasmania- the ones who will lose some <span class="highlight">votes</span> and the ones whose electors will be inconvenienced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words  Mr Howard  was saying that on the basis of a one party preferred analysis it would be proper for the Labor Party, polling 48.7 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>, to win 44.5 per cent of the seats and the Liberal Party, polling 51.3 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>, to win 55.5 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Withers  has argued that it is quite appropriate now for the Labor Party, on a one party preferred system, with just under 52 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> to obtain just over 52 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the honourable member for Gwydir,  Mr Hunt,  disagreed with the honourable member for Bennelong, not on a value judgment about what does or does not constitute a proper and fair result for a particular number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> polled, but on the facts of what would happen as a result of a 3 per cent swing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 do not know how the members of the Opposition reconcile that contradiction in the arguments put by their 2 parties; that is, one claims that a party polls 45 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> and wins 66 seats and another says the same party polls more than that and wins 59 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not my duty to advocate that the honourable member for La Trobe  (Mr Lamb)  should be entrenched in his seat with a certain percentage of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>, whereas in the last election he just scraped through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We find that the ruling Party in this Parliament at present can be entrenched in a majority of seats with 48 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we examine the redistribution we find that if the Labor Party lost some of its <span class="highlight">votes</span>, if it polled only 48 per cent of the popular vote, it could continue to hold 53 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liberal and Country Parties could obtain more than 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> in New South Wales and could do no better than win 47 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the essence of a gerrymander that a change in the popular vote does not remove a government which fails to get a majority of <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Baume  indicated that 54.9 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> in New South Wales produced for the Labor Party 56 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we go further afield to the Australian scene we find that 49 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> produced 5 1 per cent of the seats for the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In spite of the somewhat cynical remarks of the Minister for Services and Property,  Mr Daly,  from time to time when he refers to gaining <span class="highlight">votes</span> for cars, sheep, haystacks and so forth there is no doubt that behind it all there is in the Minister a determination, electorally if necessary, to destroy the National Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make it quite clear that the sort of redistribution that is proposed in New South Wales would bring about a situation in which, in round figures, 45 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> would bring the Labor Party to government and 55 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> would be necessary to bring the Liberal-National Country Party force into government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If there is to be one vote one value the party or parties which command a majority of <span class="highlight">votes</span> must win a majority of seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every one of the distributions done in our time meant that the party or parties that gained a majority of <span class="highlight">votes</span> would get a majority of seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So by its skill of penmanship the Australian Labor Party proposes that the Party should gain 4 seats with no more <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator Scott  so ably said, they have not given one vote one value to the country areas, but 6 city <span class="highlight">votes</span> are equivalent to 7 country <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, it confers an enormous advantage upon the Labor Party if its <span class="highlight">votes</span> are spread and spread widely while the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the Liberal and Country Parties are herded together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where is the one vote one value principle in the fact that, as I have said, the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of 7 country voters will equal the <span class="highlight">votes</span> formerly of 6 country voters?. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems rather banal now to talk about democracy and what has happened to it, but when people are appointed to the Senate at the whim of a State Premier rather than by means of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the people in that State being followed it makes democracy look rather sick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That idea has been canvassed around this country for a long time, and the Government insists that a vast number of people in Australia do not believe that their <span class="highlight">votes</span> should be of less value, should be worth half or one-third or one-fifth of <span class="highlight">votes</span> in other electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, that may be the view of honourable senators opposite, it may be the view of  Mr Daly  and it may be attractive to his particular type of sense of humour, but the facts are that this redistribution which  Mr Daly  promotes with such a measure of urgency month after month is a redistribution which would establish in the Australian scene a necessity for a Liberal-National Country Party coalition to achieve 55 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> in order to attain government and would enable the Labor Party to achieve government with some 45 per cent of the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the election before the last one something like- in round figures- 9000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> were needed to elect a member of Parliament from the Liberal Party, something like 6000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> were needed to elect a member of Parliament from the Country Party, and something like 14 000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> were needed to elect a member of Parliament from the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For 3 years this great upholder of the freedom of the country, this great upholder of the freedom of the electoral laws was able to cling to power as the leader of the majority party because he was able to secure at the previous poll the total of 19 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But it is again significant to note that even though the Opposition Party in the State House, which is the Labor Party, has 1 1 members- there are a couple of rag-tags amongst the Independents who are associated with and, of course, support the Liberal Party all the time- as a result of an electoral shift the Premier of great honour whom I mentioned a few moments ago and who was able to get only around 28 per cent or 29 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> was still the leader of the majority party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This power hungry man, this Premier who remains in power on a small percentage handful of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>, is in the situation in which he is able to thumb his nose at authority, thumb his nose at convention, thumb his nose at the Constitution and thumb his nose at the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have heard examples, this afternoon of a man who gets no more than 20 per cent of the vote in an entire State- one out of five <span class="highlight">votes</span>- and yet becomes the Premier of that State because he draws the map in such a way as to ensure he becomes the Premier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the value which the Country Party is trying to put forward that <span class="highlight">votes</span> should have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, it exists to express the fact that a majority of <span class="highlight">votes</span> will win a majority of seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me recite this simple situation: In 2 decades of Liberal and Country Party government the boundaries were so honest that you got a majority of the seats with a majority of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that the optional preferential voting system is a device to wreck the system of one vote one value and that in fact under such a system minority <span class="highlight">votes</span> need not have one value? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that under such a system majority party <span class="highlight">votes</span> shall always have one value and shall always be counted, but minority <span class="highlight">votes</span> will be counted or not, depending upon the whim of the particular elector who marks or does not mark the ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One vote in  Mr Daly’s  electorate would have the value of 4 <span class="highlight">votes</span> in  Mr Cadman  ‘s electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I say that under our regime there was never any question but that a party which got a majority of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> would get a majority of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the Government hopes to ensure that at an election the 127 seats will be so distributed that a majority of <span class="highlight">votes</span> gives it a majority of seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have been horrified to live in a State which until 1965 was under the control of a State Labor government which corruptly denied a vote to the people, which denied postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>, and which drew boundaries in such a way that those honourable senators who know Goulburn, for example, will know that the State Labor Government drew on a map a shape like a cow’s teat down to Captain’s Flat to take in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In  Mr Daly’s  seat, and in seats like that, one Labor vote came dangerously close to equalling 2 Liberal <span class="highlight">votes</span> elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Carrick  said that a country member of parliament needs some leeway in the weighting of <span class="highlight">votes</span> so that he can service his district. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a denial by the Liberal Party of the opportunities that stretch out before it to refuse to accept the right that it has to take a larger share of the national Parliament and possibly to deny the Country Party some of its <span class="highlight">votes</span> in this House and in the House of Representatives by making more certain that the Country Party’s representation in the Lower House is related in percentage terms to the percentage of <span class="highlight">votes</span> that it gets in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He appears to believe that if the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of country people have more value than the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the city people then in some way, which he failed to explain, that would decentralise the population geographically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of those people who lived in the city of Adelaide were worth only 25 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the people who lived in the rural areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But people cast their <span class="highlight">votes</span> in a number of confusing circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Had about 1000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> in 3 electorates gone another way we would have had a different government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following the 1974 election the number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> needed by the Opposition to capture Wilmot was only 3 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is obvious that if an election were held tomorrow in Bass the Labor Party would get fewer <span class="highlight">votes</span> than it did then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the effect of the redistributionthat is how I concluded the sentence, had  Senator Everett  been listening- is to transfer effectively some Labor <span class="highlight">votes</span> from Franklin to Denison, making the position such that instead of a 3 per cent swing being needed by the Liberal Party to win Denison under the present situation, a 5 per cent swing would be needed by” the Liberal Party to win Denison under the redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that  Mr Sherry  wisely would not want a redistribution because he could see some of his Labor <span class="highlight">votes</span> going to the Denison electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the way in which the electorate is going in Tasmania, I believe that at the next election the swing in Tasmania will be such that it does not really matter how many Labor <span class="highlight">votes</span> are transferred from Franklin to Denison. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the proposed redistribution, particularly this evening out of the situation in Denison and Franklin, is an attempt by the Government to equalise the number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> that would be needed to win these 2 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The consequence is that their ballot papers are rejected as informal and their <span class="highlight">votes</span> are wasted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I incorporate in Hansard, for the benefit of honourable senators, a statement showing the percentage of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> recorded at the 1974 Senate Election in each State and in each electoral division throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the optional preferential system proposed by this Bill a candidate cannot be elected unless he has received more than 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the count at the stage he is elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is recognised of course, that some <span class="highlight">votes</span> may become ‘exhausted ‘ during the distribution of preferences in a Division where it is necessary to exclude a candidate (or candidates) and further preferences are not shown on the ballot-papers concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the saving in informal voting which must result from the acceptance of ballot-papers which, although bearing a first preference, do not indicate preferences for all candidates, can be expected to offset <span class="highlight">votes</span> which become exhausted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We intend therefore by this Bill to assist the electors to knowingly record their <span class="highlight">votes</span>, particularly in circumstances where they are uncertain of, or unable to ascertain, the political affiliations of the candidates appearing on the ballotpaper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These facilities, together with the availability of modern day private and public transport, are adequate to enable electors to conveniently record their <span class="highlight">votes</span>, and effectively eliminates the need to keep the polling booths open until 8 p.m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The establishment of mobile polling booths in hospitals is a vital reform, one which would permit polling officials, in the presence of scrutineers, to take the ballot-boxes and voting material to bed patients, thus enabling such patients to record ordinary or absent <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This facility would be a significant step forward in making it easier for the aged and infirm to register their <span class="highlight">votes</span>, while at the same time removing the need for canvassers and political party organisers to invade the hospitals, convalescent homes and institutions, as they do at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill, the last in the series of Bills incorporating proposals previously contained in the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill, provides for- a speedier finalisation of election results, by introducing an earlier deadline for the return of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> and by providing for the return of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> direct to the relevant Returning Officer; prohibition on the listing of names of persons who apply for postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>, except in certain specified circumstances; restriction of postal vote application forms to be used at an election or referendum to those specified by notice in the Gazette; postal voting facilities for prisoners who have retained their franchise entitlements; discretion to appoint a licensed or registered surveyor as a Distribution Commissioner in lieu of the Surveyor-General of the State concerned; and other minor amendments to the existing electoral law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators are well aware, the present electoral system involves intolerable delays in finalising the election results, particularly when a large number of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> is admitted to the Scrutiny as was the case in the 1974 House of Representatives Elections when almost 5 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">votes</span> recorded throughout Australia were postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable senators I seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard  details of the number of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> admitted to the Scrutiny at the 1972 and 1974 House of Representatives Elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to remedy this situation, it is proposed, firstly, that an earlier deadline be fixed for the return of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> and, secondly, that postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> be returned direct to the relevant Returning Officer, rather than through an Assistant Returning Officer, some other Returning Officer of a Presiding Officer, as allowed under the existing law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present, a period of ten day’s grace after polling day is allowed for the receipt of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> by the relevant Returning Officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore proposed that postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> be returned so as to reach the appropriate Returning Officer not later than the close of the poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But harken to the fact that twice in this Senate in the brief time that I have been here I have heard the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Withers)  say that the Opposition would not take advantage in <span class="highlight">votes</span> in this House of the death or resignation- I will confine it to the death- of a senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee had earlier adopted 2 draft resolutions on the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination by <span class="highlight">votes</span> of 126 for, 1 against and 2 abstentions, and 126 for, 1 against and 1 abstention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But he will not create a vacuum in which there are no Appropriation Bills, a vacuum in which the Prime Minister can refuse to provide money in the mistaken hope that this will help him to win <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their views have been distorted by their counterparts in the States whose <span class="highlight">votes</span> they carry across the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also remind him that he would need to gain a majority of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> in a majority of the States of this country to change the Australian Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me tell honourable senators, some of whom may have forgotten but many of whom will know, that in the period from 1950 to 1970 individual senators who were members of the Australian Labor Party recorded approximately 6000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the assertion of the power of the Senate to reject or to take equivalent action by deferral or other similar action on a money Bill as defined by  Mr Odgers  and as accepted by this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1971, in relation to the Post and Telegraph Bill, 3 <span class="highlight">votes</span> were taken to reject it, namely, on the second reading, at the committee stage and on the third reading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may respond to the interjection,  Mr President,  I think it possibly could be a matter that the people who conceive legislation in the Opposition ranks could well consider the possibility of making it mandatory for members of the Opposition to have secret <span class="highlight">votes</span> in their party meetings since they seem to think it is a good idea in union elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party has abrogated, through its <span class="highlight">votes</span> in this House and through its speeches in this House and in the other place, its right to claim that it defends the interests of the people in the matter of the basic thrust of democratic government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he <span class="highlight">votes</span> against securities and exchange legislation in this country because he wants to protect that group, I think that that is also the height of hypocrisy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the figures for the Senate in the last double dissolution in May of last year we find that 1 032 460 formal <span class="highlight">votes</span> were cast in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many <span class="highlight">votes</span> did the late  Senator Milliner,  who was a personal friend of us all, poll? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He polled 441 060 <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Government did not permit the motion to be debated and immediately moved the gag, was the intent of the motion to commit publicly all <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the Australian Labor Party to the course of action of the Prime Minister? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead, the entrenched weighting of <span class="highlight">votes</span> under the present system, which very much suits the National Country Party at the expense of all the urban dwellers of Australia and,  I  might say, at the expense even of Liberal supporters in the urban areas of Australia, was retained by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am surprised that members of the Opposition parties, who have always decried the philosophy that the end justifies the means, should apply this very principle so far as this Government is concerned- a goverment which twice in 3 years has been given a majority in the Lower House and which, even in the double dissolution elections of 1974, failed by a handful of <span class="highlight">votes</span> in Queensland and New South Wales to win the additional seat in each of those States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">votes</span> on any motion are equal, the motion is defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are still <span class="highlight">votes</span> for Australian Labor Party senators there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is concerned about the decline which the National Country Party would suffer if the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of citizens in the cities of Australia were worth the same as the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of citizens in certain country electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a difference of one in this place and the vote here will possibly be 29 <span class="highlight">votes</span> to 28, or even allowing for pairs, with a majority of just one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the last Senate election in 1974 the Australian Labor Party gained approximately 200 000 more <span class="highlight">votes</span> than the Liberal and Country parties senators who sit opposite us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although in the last Senate election we polled some 200 000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> more than our opposing parties, we received less than a majority in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government increased its representation in the Senate from 26 to 29 members and attracted 200 000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> in excess of the combined vote of the Opposition senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I assure the honourable senator that under the existing <span class="highlight">votes</span> for travel by Ministers, office holders and others, funds are getting very tight indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no part of the Governor-General’s function to give advice as to the way any member of this Parliament <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members of the Opposition in the Senate this morning, by their <span class="highlight">votes</span> taken on the voices, declared these Bills to be urgent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, I am faced with the position that, some <span class="highlight">votes</span> under the Supply Acts are subject to greater demands than others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751111_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of the ballot is:  Senator Drake-Brockman  36 <span class="highlight">votes</span>;  Senator Melzer  27 <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760217_senate_30_s67/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Then, as my colleague says, we gained many thousands more <span class="highlight">votes</span> than our political opponents; then a mere 12 months after that double dissolution we had the death of one of our colleagues in the Senate and the plot that had been in existence for some time was put into effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been some suggestions that not only was the power of the media involved but also there could have been a lot of bribes given for the purpose of purchasing <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How much was paid throughout Australia to hopeless independent candidates in order to get them publicity to win <span class="highlight">votes</span> on the condition that they give their second preference to candidates standing for the purpose of opposing the Government then in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-That we did not buy <span class="highlight">votes</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would make a declaration for my Party that we did not purchase <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be said that the big rallies purchased <span class="highlight">votes</span>, but here is a Minister of the Crown who is justifying the purchase of <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that all Labor people contributed for the purpose of attracting <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I give an annual contribution for the purpose of attracting <span class="highlight">votes</span> but I did not give a penny for the purpose of getting Michael Cavanough a vote in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the purchase of <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the fact cannot be avoided that people outside a particular political party were paid to enter this election for the purpose of purchasing <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The gentlemen on my right will recall that the 1969 election, when I happened to be the member for Grey, was held under a redistribution that was introduced by my Party which excluded no less than 8000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> from one of my blue ribbon rural areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was able, with the support of my Party, to be defeated on preferences when the present member for Grey was saying that I was going to be beaten by 7000 <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present member for Grey won the seat by about 550 <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was there canvassing for <span class="highlight">votes</span> and did not talk about the mining venture but on the other 3 occasions I did speak to the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as  Dr Evatt  was wrong and just as successive ballot boxes carrying the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the electors rejected the Labor Party, so indeed it has happened this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That doctrine was imposed to win <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the short term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those 4 senators, could be elected on the preference <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the other political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It reminded us all too often that we represented only the same number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> as the city of Newcastle and so did not rate special attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that on a recount of almost 2.8 million <span class="highlight">votes</span> only some 10 000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> changed hands? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the majority for the successful candidate for the last Senate seat in New South Wales change only from 800 to some 2000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the recount? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to his statistical information relating to how the <span class="highlight">votes</span> changed hands, his figures are correct, as I recall them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the defect in the system, not the method of counting the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be recognised and made public that candidates and workers for the Liberal Party in the Labor-held seats in South Australia did a great deal in attracting a large number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> for Senate candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it was probably because it is very many years since the Liberal and Country Parties captured the first position in a Senate ballot in terms of <span class="highlight">votes</span> recorded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Chief Australian Electoral Officer has informed me that he has supplied the honourable senator with copies of Election Form 62 (‘Results of the Scrutiny of First Preference <span class="highlight">Votes</span> in Respect of Polling Places’) for each State and Territory, in respect of the 1975 House of Representatives election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-44-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What was the total number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> recorded and the percentage of that vote on (a) a national basis and (b) a State and Territory basis for all candidates contesting the 1975 House of Representatives election on behalf of the Australia Party, the Australian Labor Party, the Communist Party, the Australian Democratic Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the National Country Party and the Workers Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-44-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-And we gained 57 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>; the honourable senator is quite right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we had received another 200 or 300 <span class="highlight">votes</span> we would have had equal numbers in the Senate and honourable senators would have seen a different set-up here today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my own State of Western Australia, where all people are equal, but some are 16 times as equal as others because they have a vote in the Legislative Council of Western Australia which is worth 16 <span class="highlight">votes</span> of other Western Australian citizens, quite massive income taxes can be and may be applied by a Parliament which is elected on a basis which is democratic to the extent of a ratio of 16 to one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the recent New South Wales election it is true that Labor had, I think, some 6 more candidates fielded in electorates than previously so that this time it registered a larger vote, which last time was disguised in independent <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The vote for Labor in the previous election was artificially lower because its vote was hidden in independent <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These little men, these miserable men, these socialist men who only give public money where they cannot multiply <span class="highlight">votes</span> and in this area because the agriculture industries as a whole provided only 6 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>, they ignored them, But they gave $8m for idle time on the waterfront, $500m for the unemployed, and all the rest of their squandermania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I live in Sydney and the establishment of national parks in the Northern Territory will not mean more <span class="highlight">votes</span> for me, but as an Australian I would like to believe that we will see this vision which was John Grey Gorton’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The document is dated 9 September 1976 and it shows the proportion of <span class="highlight">votes</span> that the Labor Party had to get to win government in South Australia as against the proportion of <span class="highlight">votes</span> received by the Liberal Country League over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, while a politician may find it ‘appropriate’ to promise us all sorts of things to woo our <span class="highlight">votes</span>, he may find it quite inappropriate to deliver the goods once the ballot forms have been filled in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we would all feel that that was characteristic of him because he often went in knowing that perhaps he had no <span class="highlight">votes</span> at all but that he would win the argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that on a recount of almost 2.8 million <span class="highlight">votes</span> only some 10 000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> changed hands? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the majority for, the successful candidate for the last Senate seat in New South Wales change only from 800 to some 2000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the recount? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have done so too if I had been the candidate defeated by 854 <span class="highlight">votes</span>, as I think the result was at that stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although  Senator Baume  says that only 10 000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> changed hands, I think the system under which we are operating needs an overhaul. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 10 000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> to which  Senator Baume  referred were nearly all additional informal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Approximately 4500 <span class="highlight">votes</span> were taken from the Liberal-Country Party total, 3600 were taken from the Australian Labor Party and 300 were taken from the Socialist Workers League which had been the recipient of the donkey vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that actually many more <span class="highlight">votes</span> changed hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It shows that in the recount it was found that <span class="highlight">votes</span> had been credited to the wrong candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had scrutineers ringing me up and saying that a bundle of 50 or 100 <span class="highlight">votes</span> credited to the LiberalCountry Party should have been mine, and vice versa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, many more than 10 000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> were involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also when we are talking about 10 000 informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> that were wiped out, we have to consider that scrutineers reported that many informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> that originally were put out of the ballot were then put back into the ballot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we consider that the final vote which elected the last senator, who happened to be myself, showed a majority of 2016, those 10 000 plus <span class="highlight">votes</span> tend to assume rather critical significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit again that if the <span class="highlight">votes</span> were recounted today the totals would probably be altered because of the near impossible task given to the officials of the Australian Electoral Office in scrutinising the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of 53 candidates in the Senate election in 1975 and, perhaps even worse, the <span class="highlight">votes</span> for 73 candidates who stood for New South Wales in 1 974.I think it should be mentioned also that because there was a complete recount there was also a new random sample. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the people of the United States went to the polls only yesterday or early this morning Australian time, probably nearly all the <span class="highlight">votes</span> for governors and senators have been counted, and with perhaps 80 million <span class="highlight">votes</span> to be counted, the new  President  of the United States is probably known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the donkey vote and at those statistics, we find that 22 230 <span class="highlight">votes</span> drifted directly across to the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in fact the drift was much more than that because 2302 <span class="highlight">votes</span> went to the Family Action Movement, 474 went to the Democratic Labor Party and 233 went to the Workers Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This cost the Government Parties thousands of <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This meant that people moved across the ballot paper to the righthand side, came back to the lefthand side and finished their <span class="highlight">votes</span> with the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The vast number of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> I have talked about did show a clear intention to vote for one party or the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I do not want to dwell on what is happening in the United States of America today but it is an example of how millions of <span class="highlight">votes</span> can be computed quickly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think we should get back to the <span class="highlight">votes</span> before the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With regard to the escalation of costs as to particular items both in the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, which has a bloc vote, and the National Capital Development Commission, which has a bloc vote, it may be taken into account in discount of the tedium that I have inflicted on the Committee that we take some credit for having handspiked out of these bloc <span class="highlight">votes</span> particular items that do demand scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator Scott  has spoken in this debate, since the question of new federalism was a central, if not the central, issue in the New South Wales election which was held on 1 May and which much to the consternation of the Liberal Party resulted in the defeat of the then Liberal Government and the election of a Labor Government which was campaigning vigorously against the new federalism, and since I understand that  Senator Scott  has received a telegram from the Premier of that State asking him to vote against this Bill- given that on 1 May the people of New South Wales also voted against this legislation- it will be interesting to see how  Senator Scott  <span class="highlight">votes</span> on this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As we mentioned earlier this afternoon, we believe that that provision will be a bind on the task that will be given to the electoral commissioners in drawing up reasonable and sensible boundaries based on the principle of ensuring that the party with the greatest majority of <span class="highlight">votes</span> on a percentage basis has the majority of seats in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Douglas  McClelland said this afternoon that there are no details as to how the <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast at an election can be counted and how the election can operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that there will be an inability to count the <span class="highlight">votes</span> by the time the writs are returnable, the provision has been included in this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While, at all times, the Labor Party adopts the principle of equal value for <span class="highlight">votes</span>, the problem is that those who, through economic circumstances, have moved to outer urban areas now lack many essential services such as sewerage, adequate roads, safe and efficient public transport services, reasonable rates and suitable houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The commissioners to be appointed will have a tremendous responsibility because it will be up to them to make recommendations which will ensure that when the election is held the party which gets the greatest number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> or the greatest percentage of <span class="highlight">votes</span> also gets the greatest number of seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liberal Party of Australia got approximately 42 per cent of the vote and sixty-eight of its members were elected to the House of Representatives on a basis of 47 000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> per member elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The National Country Party, with a little over 1 1 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>, had 23 members elected to the House of Representatives on an average of 37 000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> for each candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think  Senator Douglas  McClelland also had some worries about the fact that the Labor Party obtained a certain percentage of <span class="highlight">votes</span> but did not get the same percentage of seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the election is held under conditions laid down by regulation, what is to prevent a government or a political party deciding in a State where it believes it can get more than 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> that it will issue regulations providing for what is usually known as an exhaustive preferential ballot? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>House of Representatives elections held in 1954, 1961, and again in 1969 showed that the party getting the majority of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> did not get the majority of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is exactly what it was last time when a candidate could gain an additional 25 000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> if his name was near the top of the ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 position on a ballot paper- he may be completely unrepresentative of any electors in a State in Australia- thereby gets 25 000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> or more, that system needs an overhaul. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was because of the displeasure of the voters in that State with the disregard which the Federal Government had for that State’s interests that  Mr Menzies,  the then Prime Minister, came within a handful of <span class="highlight">votes</span> of becoming  Mr Menzies,  the Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the spurious arguments of some of his coalition colleagues who intend to oppose the referenda in the electorate but who say that their <span class="highlight">votes</span> in this place for the measures are simply to allow the people a chance to vote on them, will the Minister give an undertaking that their <span class="highlight">votes</span> for the measures under these circumstances will not be used in support of the official Yes case to be delivered to each elector? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If, after the election, the Senate comes back upheld in its stand upon an equal vote in each State with equality of numbers in this chamber, but if Sydney and Melbourne, with their 79 <span class="highlight">votes</span> out of 125, prevail in the House of Representatives, the Representatives view can be established only if there is a majority in a joint sitting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proper way to give representation to a successor of a vacant seat under proportional representation is to recount the <span class="highlight">votes</span> because the <span class="highlight">votes</span> at a single election must be represented in the proportion in which the people then voted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind you,  Mr President  and the Senate, that this is the case despite statements that have been made by the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt),  despite the <span class="highlight">votes</span> that have been taken in the House of Representatives on this subject and despite the referendum that was held in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Prior to the adjournment I had had incorporated in  Hansard  a chart showing the percentage of <span class="highlight">votes</span> received by the respective parties in South Australia over a period covering 37 years and 14 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have to look at is the number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> received by any political party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What  Senator Messner  is endeavouring to say is that we should lump together the percentage of <span class="highlight">votes</span> received by independents and those received by the Liberal Party and say that represents the Liberal Party vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the preferences had been allocated right across the board a lot of those <span class="highlight">votes</span> would have come to the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has taken a set of figures which simply show party <span class="highlight">votes</span>, comparing one party with the other, since 1938 to the given date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, there is no way that he can draw a statistically balanced judgment merely by comparing percentages of party <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator McLaren  emphasised those elections last night and related the 1938 election result to the fact that the Liberal Party in South Australia gained only 3 1 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the 1975 election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Theoretically we could have a situation where the rank and file have determined the rules under which they wish to operate, where <span class="highlight">votes</span> have been taken under plebiscite rules, and still the Court could superimpose, under section  17  Id a scheme of reconstruction that is not consistent with the wishes of the members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He showed that on every occasion the Australian Labor Party never received less than 40 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> and that a government, receiving a minority of <span class="highlight">votes</span>, was elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But  Senator Messner  cannot say that there was not a gerrymander in 1953 when Labor received 50.97 per cent of the total vote- that was a majority of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>- and was defeated in its attempt to gain government by a party that received 36.45 per cent of the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when all seats were contested in the March 1968 election, Labor received 51.98 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> and was defeated by a party that received 43.82 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every time an attempt is made in the United Nations to deal with a situation of this nature, the great body of the United Nations <span class="highlight">votes</span> against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Sir Magnus Cormack, in relation to South Africa, has failed to understand that the United Nations, by an overwhelming majority and in many cases by <span class="highlight">votes</span> in excess of ninety with a small number of countries abstaining and with one or two countries in opposition- often countries like Spain- called upon the rest of the United Nations organisation to assist in decolonisation and in the movement for independence in Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think two areas that could be given better attention than has been the case in the past are firstly, the remuneration of people operating in the Antarctic bases and secondly- I have raised this with the Minister before in Estimate Committee hearings- the right of people in the Antarctic to vote and the ability of those people to be able to cast their <span class="highlight">votes</span> in elections and referenda and matters of that kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to remind  Senator Grimes  that there was a vast difference also between the percentage of <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the Senate for the ALP in Tasmania at the last Senate election and the percentage at the previous election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that the Australian Farmers Federation, as a result of the Government’s lack of decision to alleviate the problems of the farmers, is now urging its members to use their <span class="highlight">votes</span> against the Liberal Party and the National Country Party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not until it became important in 1963, when the LiberalCountry Party Government had a one seat majority in the Parliament, that that Government found it necessary to buy a few <span class="highlight">votes</span> by giving assistance to non-government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately years ago in 1963 there was no doubt, as I said earlier, that the Liberal Government of the day, desperate for <span class="highlight">votes</span>, was prepared to use exactly that sectarian weapon and buy <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The United Nations charter clearly states that decisions should be taken with the affirmative <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the five permanent members of the Council- the United States, Great Britain, France, Russia and China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can understand the Security Council finding this procedure convenient for its ordinary day to day affairs, but when it comes to Chapter 7 decisions involving the peace and threats to the peace, war, blockade, sanctions and international security then one would expect decisions to be taken with the concurring <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the five permanent members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now possible for the Security Council to take momentous decisions and implement them without the concurring <span class="highlight">votes</span> of any of the five permanent members, and I believe that to be outside the intent, spirit and letter of the United Nations charter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since, under new voting procedures, only nine affirmative <span class="highlight">votes</span> are needed to take decisions, according to the doctrine on abstentions the Council can adopt substantive resolutions in cases where all five of the permanent members have abstained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been proved that the Labor Government increased the costs of the people of the outback and that it had no regard for those people because it supported the multitude that lived on the eastern coast where the <span class="highlight">votes</span> were. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to remind him of the percentage of <span class="highlight">votes</span> the Liberal and National Country parties did get and the number of seats they got with that vote under the old system of election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1975 election the Australian Labor Party polled 3,313,004 <span class="highlight">votes</span>, or 42.8 per cent, and we won 36 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party polled 3,248,136 <span class="highlight">votes</span>, or 42 per cent, that is, 0.8 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> less than the Labor Party got, but the Liberals won 68 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It polled 853,943 <span class="highlight">votes</span>- 1 1 per cent of the vote- and got 23 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the National Country Party gets 1 1 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> but wins 23 seats, whilst we get 42.8 per cent and only 36 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, comparing the figures, we find that the Labor Party polled nearly four times the number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the National Country Party, yet we got only 13 more seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The idea is that we should have premature <span class="highlight">votes</span> on subjects which are unnecessary and which are polarising so far as the community is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been too busy looking after the large number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the eastern States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In answer to  Senator Cavanagh  who asks whether I have won any <span class="highlight">votes</span>, I do not make any such claim this evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can say that  Mr Whitlam  has lost a good deal of <span class="highlight">votes</span> for the Labor Party and I have given some of the reasons in, I admit, a rather casual assessment of the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, he won very narrowly by ten <span class="highlight">votes</span> in a very high poll held on the campus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 24 October a meeting of ATEA members in Perth rejected the Federal Council resolution by 240 <span class="highlight">votes</span> to 170 <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a typical State Labor government attitude which is more anxious to gain <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the metropolitan area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was, in fact, done by the commissioners and that then brought the Kalgoorlie division 901 <span class="highlight">votes</span> above the minimum number of electors required by the 1974 amendments to the Electoral Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the electorate of Kalgoorlie, which already was almost 1,000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> over the minimum required by the Commonwealth Electoral Act, the Commissioners added a small portion of the shire of Yalgoo and the entire shires of Carnamah and Perenjori and Three Springs, which involved a total of 1,670 <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>So by the unnecessary inclusion of those three shires in the Federal division of Kalgoorlie the Liberal Party, which currently holds the seat, has gained in net terms in excess of 1,000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> which could well be enough to enable the Liberal Party to retain the seat at the forthcoming election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> would most probably run at 95 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How would we count the <span class="highlight">votes</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It <span class="highlight">votes</span> one way in the Parliament but goes out and tells the producers something else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the present system, the <span class="highlight">votes</span> take too long to count. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Millions of <span class="highlight">votes</span> are cast, yet the result is known within 24 hours of the ballot closing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the best place to look at in relation to the quick counting of <span class="highlight">votes</span> is Great Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the State of New South Wales, which is the experience to which I will continue to refer, 12.13 per cent of the Senate <span class="highlight">votes</span> in 1974 were informal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1975, despite the campaign waged by both major parties, more than 10 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>, or one in ten, were informal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that about 12,000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast were awarded to different candidates as a result of the recount and that there was a reduction in the total number of formal <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When faced with a situation such as that which occurred in New South Wales in the last election, where in the first count there was a difference of only 19 <span class="highlight">votes</span> per electorate for the 45 electorates, it is apparent that the system of random sampling also needs investigating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe it will cut down drastically on the number of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I thought that there were a number of defects in the American presidential system in which, as I understand it, theoretically a candidate can receive a majority of the electoral college <span class="highlight">votes</span> without receiving the majority of the popular <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think it was good for democracy when well over 12 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> were informal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s failure to act upon the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Public Libraries is scandalous and certainly will be used against it by the Labor movement and the people of Australia when they cast their <span class="highlight">votes</span> at the forthcoming Federal election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It certainly is not uncommon in the United Kingdom, with its first past the post system, for a party to get 60 per cent of the seats with 30 per cent or 40 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I think I said many times in Opposition, between 1949 and 1975, with the exception of one occasion, the party or parties that obtained the greatest number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> gained office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Given the rate of increase in <span class="highlight">votes</span> for our Party at each election I expect that  Senator Young’s  Party will some day be in the minority position in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the <span class="highlight">votes</span> were taken on that amendment you yourself,  Mr President,  voted for the amendment, so you acquiesced with your Party at that time in the use of those words on more than one occasion against the members of the Parliamentary Labor Party and in particular against the Prime Minister of the day,  Mr Whitlam,  and his Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would welcome suggestions and ideas because I think this is a matter on which all parties agee that all persons who have an entitlement to enrol ought to be encouraged and assisted to do so and, having enrolled, they ought to be given the greatest possible help in casting valid <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one bears in mind the great, important and onerous responsibilities of the divisional returning officers at a Federal general election, especially when a ballot is very tight- when a seat or even a government can be determined by a mere handful of <span class="highlight">votes</span>- one can see that one needs a person whose pay is at a level in accord- .ance with the responsible position he is occupying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, if the game was being played as it was in the case of the 1974 and 1975 elections it would be a very interesting experience- and I would revel in it- to bring the three electoral commissioners to the bar of the Senate and ask them what the result would have been if another 4,000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> had been added. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am calling on memory, but I think that somewhere in the <span class="highlight">votes</span> for the Attorney-General’s Department an item is shown for the costs of litigation or legal costs paid on behalf of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, when her leader brought on a hurried election and the Government had to scamper around and bring in something that would appeal for <span class="highlight">votes</span>, it sought to amend the Bill and afford provision over and above what the Budget had contemplated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to note, when looking at the final figures- I am talking now of the primary <span class="highlight">votes</span> in South Australia- that in the House of Representatives election the Liberal Party polled 45 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>, whilst the Australian Labor Party polled 42.6 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So the ratio of Yes to No <span class="highlight">votes</span> in Queensland was eight to one which is a pretty good indication that there is massive support in that State for the proposition that the Commonwealth has a constitutional responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the socialists on the other side of the chamber will realise that by pandering to one national group which it thinks will vote for it, it will not get those <span class="highlight">votes</span> because the majority of migrants in Australia, those who really want to settle down, realise that the socialists are only using them as a political football. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When, after a two-year process of consideration and negotiation in which Australia participated actively, the amendments to the Articles were settled within the Fund’s Executive Board and presented to the Governors of the Fund for consideration, the Treasurer of that time cast Australia’s <span class="highlight">votes</span> in favour of approving them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The increase in Australia ‘s quota will also bring a corresponding increase in the number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> Australia has in decision-making within the Fund, although since our proposed quota increase under the sixth general review is less than proportional to the overall increase, Australia’s relative voting strength will be marginally reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the honourable senators on the other side of the chamber,  Senator Mulvihill,  had more than a million <span class="highlight">votes</span>, but  Sir Robert  Cotton with almost one and a quarter million <span class="highlight">votes</span> has had more <span class="highlight">votes</span> in a single election than has any other candidate in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, this comment could apply similarly to Queensland today where it requires almost twice as many <span class="highlight">votes</span> as are required to elect to Parliament a member of the Labor Party as are required to elect a member of the National Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If one looks at voting patterns in New South Wales one can see the absurd position in which the Labor Party and the Liberal Party polled somewhat the same number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> and yet the proportion of seats is overwhelmingly in favour of the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We find that the number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> received by the Australian Democrats equalled the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the National Country Party yet the Democrats were denied representation in the lower House whereas the Country Party has representation in that House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the report says and as, I think,  Senator Baume  mentioned, for too long in this country and in other countries the whole debate on drug abuse has been clouded by hysteria on both sides, for and against, by the use of anecdotal evidence without any scientific backing up and, which is inevitable, I suppose, particularly in our political system, by the use of this debate by some people to gain a segment of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the community by playing on the prejudices of those people whom they believe they need to support them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, if we continue to shout at each other and to air our prejudices in this Parliament and in the media, and if we continue to condemn those whose views differ from ours to gain political <span class="highlight">votes</span> in political ballots or according to the prejudices we think the community has, we will continue to go the way we are going as an intoxicated society; and the only difference that will occur is that the variety of those intoxicants will increase, the absolute volume of those intoxicants used will increase, and we will get nowhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Back when <span class="highlight">votes</span> were being wooed, back in 1975 and again in 1977, there were promises of tax reductions which came, and then went. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that  Senator Missen,  together with those of his colleagues who have expressed great concern about this impost, as have honourable Opposition senators, will take the necessary action before the Budget debate is concluded and before the <span class="highlight">votes</span> are taken to see that the proposed impost is not levied on these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister made certain promises in order to gain <span class="highlight">votes</span>; with a cynical disregard he has dishonoured those promises; just as he promised that he would maintain Medibank- we know what has happened to that institution; just as he promised that he would support wage indexation- we know what he has done; just as he promised that he would reduce interest rates by 2 per cent- there are only eight weeks left for him to fulfil that promise because he said that he would do it during 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind every honourable senator on the Government side of the chamber who <span class="highlight">votes</span> against  Senator Ryan’s  motion and  Senator Evans’s  amendment that, having in mind  Senator Rae  ‘s contingent notice of motion, they are voting against the recommendations which I am about to read. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All these issues attracted free <span class="highlight">votes</span> from honourable senators on this side of the Senate chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In election years the coalition Government probably gave them $ 1 or $ 1 .2 5 in an attempt to buy their <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We in the Australian Labor Party are criticised and told that we try to buy <span class="highlight">votes</span> from the pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last week the ex-Minister for Social Security,  Senator Chipp,  placed on record in this Parliament that the coalition Government did buy the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is now having second thoughts; attempts should not be made to buy the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That, unless otherwise ordered, the <span class="highlight">Votes</span> in Schedule 2 be considered in the same groupings and order as the departmental estimates referred to Estimates Committees A, B, C, D, E and F, respectively, as set out in the document circulated to honourable senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Not only does the Executive presently determine the aggregate allocation of funds to the legislature, but it also has day-to-day control of much of those funds, as a large proportion of the moneys relating to the functioning of the Parliament is contained in the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of Executive departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, there is a tendency, I believe amongst all of us, to regard the Australian Electoral Office as an organisation which concerns itself almost solely with the maintenance of the electoral roll, the running of elections and the counting of <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Voters in polling places have also received personal assistance because the Australian Electoral Office has endeavoured to ensure that Poll Clerks fluent in one or more languages have been employed at those booths where large numbers of former migrants are expected to record their <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That achieved the objective of reducing the number of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast and simplified the electoral process without necessarily taking away the right of the electors to record a full formal vote inasmuch as they could extend their preferences if they so desired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This represents the lowest percentage of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> recorded in an election at large for a considerable number of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of the Minister and of the Senate to the fact that an even better breakdown of the figures shows, for example, that the number of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the seat of Sydney in 1974 was 20.5 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, that is Senate informal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The percentage of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> in areas such as Bradfield, Berowra, Wentworth and Warringah were 5.59, 7.3, 7.4 and 9.2 respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have pointed to the reduction in the number of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> in both local government and State elections in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But whatever the merits or demerits of providing funds at concessional interest rates, there is no excuse for making extravagant promises, as the Prime Minister did just a year ago, which become inoperative as soon as the <span class="highlight">votes</span> are safely in the ballot box. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that  Mr Nixon  will honour that promise which is contained in the letter I received today and that next year he will not endeavour to back away from the promise made by his colleague,  Mr Sinclair,  when that Minister was seeking <span class="highlight">votes</span> in Alice Springs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government members are already on record as saying, when buying <span class="highlight">votes</span> in the Northern Territory- that is the best way one can put it- that there would be a special allocation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know what formula we can use so that we can have members of the minority parties and the independent honourable senator speaking in debates, but as we received over twelve per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> one would think that one-eighth of the speaking time would be reasonable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what is being done, notwithstanding a firm promise by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  at the last election on which he must have won hundreds of thousands of <span class="highlight">votes</span>- possibly millions of <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having made that additional point which is pertinent to this debate, I repeat that we of the Australian Democrats pledge ourselves to support the Australian Labor Party in any moves it might want to make in conformity with the Standing Orders in an effort to force the Government in some way to honour the promise on which it won millions of <span class="highlight">votes</span> in 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An agreed sum is fixed for each elector according to the number of <span class="highlight">votes</span> polled for each of the parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommendations continue: Secondly, as a party, it must have polled at least 150,000 <span class="highlight">votes</span> and had at least one member elected in the previous election; or thirdly, as a party, it must have had at least two of its candidates returned as members in the previous election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That motion was lost because of the equality of <span class="highlight">votes</span> and, let it be clearly said, because of the vigorous opposition to it that the then  Senator Lionel  Murphy led at that conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He pointed to the fact that people on Palm Island who were on the Commonwealth and State electoral rolls were, by the decision of the Queensland Government, taken off the Palm Island rolls because their <span class="highlight">votes</span> may have brought about a result which was different from what the Queensland Minister for Aboriginal and Island Affairs,  Mr Porter,  desired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that if the political records of this country are perused it will be seen that we had to get only about 200 <span class="highlight">votes</span> over about four seats throughout the length and breadth of Australia and a Labor government would have been elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the fact that we had four undesirable candidates who would corrupt the Commonwealth Parliament if they were elected, in the electorate of Moreton in Brisbane the Labor Party lost by only 14 <span class="highlight">votes</span> after the distribution of the Communist Party preferences and Killen the magnificent was returned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that it has been alleged by  Mr Daly  that  Mr Ellicott  intervened in the counting of the ballot for the seat of Parramatta, giving legal advice to the returning officer for that division in respect of the validity of certain postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>, which advice had the effect of favouring the position of the Liberal Party candidate– <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Included under Administrative Expenses <span class="highlight">votes</span> is $2. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that the Chief Australian Electoral Officer sought advice from the First Assistant Crown Solicitor,  Mr B.  J. O ‘Donovan, on 12 December 1972 concerning the proper interpretation of the legislative provisions with respect to the counting of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> concerned were for the Division of Parramatta. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> in issue was 1 57. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr O ‘Donovan consulted the then SolicitorGeneral,  Mr Ellicott,  on the matter that had been raised with him and each of them concluded that, although the matter was not clear beyond doubt, the better view was that the <span class="highlight">votes</span> should not be rejected or disallowed if the Divisional Returning Officer was satisfied as to matters set out in paragraph (b) of section 96 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both  Mr O  ‘Donovan and  Mr Ellicott  were of the view that strong argument could be put for the view that the Divisional Returning Officer had a residual discretion to disallow some or all of the postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> in issue and that it was a matter for the Divisional Returning Officer to decide which course he would adopt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both  Mr O  ‘Donovan and  Mr Ellicott  expressed the view that whichever course was adopted by the Divisional Returning Officer a petition to the court of disputed returns would be likely to be made if the final count left the two main contending candidates for the Division of Parramatta less than 157 <span class="highlight">votes</span> apart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, the advice from the Attorney-General ‘s Department was given without knowledge of which candidate would be favoured by admitting or rejecting the postal <span class="highlight">votes</span> in issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The most blatant attempt ever to buy <span class="highlight">votes</span> was an advertisement showing a hand with a fistful of notes- we all remember it in the 1977 election campaign- and  Mr Fraser  uttering some prophetic words. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I may have lost some <span class="highlight">votes</span> because I told the children to ask their parents to take them out and show them the Southern Cross, and that night was a bitterly cold night in that part of Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that the Commonwealth Electoral Officer,  Mr Pearson,  has carried out a survey of informal <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast during the 1975 and 1977 elections? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that it is intended to make the survey available to the Parliament so that optional preferential voting can be instituted with the intention that all <span class="highlight">votes</span> properly recorded will be properly reflected in the ultimate result? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask them to bear in mind that one can get situations where State electoral law can be more permissive in terms of helping such people to get <span class="highlight">votes</span> than can Commonwealth legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer very quickly to page 31 of  Mr Justice  Kay’s report for his comments on postal <span class="highlight">votes</span>, which again 1 think are useful in pointing out the differences between the States and the difficulties of ensuring, when a marksman is involved, that one is getting a vote from the person who is claimed to have his name on the electoral roll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just in case he does say that, I point out to him that experience has shown- the <span class="highlight">votes</span> will prove this- that it is very difficult for members of any government to turn their backs on that Government and to reject any regulation made by it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The inhuman and unchristian people who speak in this place to gain <span class="highlight">votes</span> take the attitude that they do not care whether 5,000 people, or 10,000 people, or however many will be employed at Roxby Downs, will suffer the lingering death of painful cancer and that men are easily replaced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, because of the electoral reform that was introduced by a Labor government, any party in South Australia that can obtain 50 per cent of the electors’ <span class="highlight">votes</span> on a broad base over the whole State will have the required numbers in the upper House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Despite  Senator Teague  ‘s optimism, if there is a drop in the percentage of <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast for Labor- I do not think there will be- it has to be to the extent of seven per cent for the Liberals to get into government, and it has to occur in the metropolitan seats now held by Labor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At that election he polled 6.6 per cent of the vote in Patersonsome 4250 <span class="highlight">votes</span>- compared with 1.45 per cent for  Mr William  Ignatius O’Donnell, an independent candidate, 57.61 per cent for  Mr Frank  Lionel O ‘Keefe, the National Country Party candidate, and 34.28 per cent for Kerry Donald Scott, the Australian Labor Party candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe there is a moral obligation on the Australian Democrats, as a political organisation and as a political party, to honour a debt incurred in terms of material prepared not only for the promotion of  Mr Baker  as a candidate but for the promotion of  Senator Mason,  who gathered together the 6.6 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> that he received in the electorate of Paterson, in amassing the total of <span class="highlight">votes</span> which brought him, as an Australian Democrat, into this Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The peculiar system of voting for the South Australian Legislative Council means that <span class="highlight">votes</span> cast for any group other than the major parties may result in preferences not being distributed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact that it was a lie was proven because the <span class="highlight">votes</span> for a candidate for the Australian Democrats- a minority party- were counted and he was elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It eventually went to the Court of Disputed Returns where allegations were made that Liberal Party candidates and members of the Liberal Party had applied undue pressure to members of the Aboriginal communities to ensure that their <span class="highlight">votes</span> were not cast in the way they wished them to be cast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to quote part of an article in today’s Melbourne  Age  headed ‘Loan “bought <span class="highlight">votes</span>” Cover Up, says Wilkes’, who is the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  own party was also criticising the Liberal Government for what it did to buy <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we have often spelt out in this place what the people who sit opposite will do to buy the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before we depart from estimates for the Department of Primary Industry are those honourable senators going to dissociate themselves from their Victorian colleagues and say that their colleagues are completely wrong in criticising  Mr Smith  because he let the cat out of the bag by saying that $9m of taxpayers’ money was put at risk in order to buy a few <span class="highlight">votes</span> in Victoria? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In future we will have to give closer attention to similar types of legislation brought into the Parliament as we now have on record a State Minister of Agriculture saying that this type of legislation was introduced only to buy the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are now pushing through the <span class="highlight">votes</span> in Group E, which involve the expenditure of almost $ 1,000m, as though we are talking about a kid’s pocket money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my colleague the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Dawkins)  has indicated in the other place, such is the redistribution that it requires my party to gain more than 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">votes</span> in order to exceed the quota of two seats in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-101">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor <span class="highlight">votes</span> locked away, so it cannot be seen as a redistribution which is locking away a majority of Labor <span class="highlight">votes</span> in a way which disadvantages the Labor Party in other seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-101">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest to all honourable senators that they look at the percentages of <span class="highlight">votes</span> obtained by the parties in the last three elections which are contained in the figures which were distributed by the Australian Electoral Office to all senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-101">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At first it was believed that the idea of running the Premier’s wife was merely to attract <span class="highlight">votes</span> to the National Party team by capitalising on the Bjelke-Petersen name. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-111-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There she would have no hope of winning but could have drawn <span class="highlight">votes</span> to the team. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-111-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not detail those events, but ultimately an appeal was lodged with a Court of Disputed Returns by the Australian Labor Party candidate, Ernie Bridge, who had been defeated by 93 <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Justice Smith found that 96 people had been improperly deprived of their right to vote for Ernie Bridge and for that reason declared the election void- the winning margin having been only 93 <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The objective was to prevent Aborigines from recording <span class="highlight">votes</span>, or if that failed, from recording valid <span class="highlight">votes</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>I understand that sums totalling $7,264.82 and chargeable against the <span class="highlight">votes</span> of the Attorney-General ‘s Department have been paid to, or in respect of the attendance of, Miss Artopoulou as a witness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-32">[More…]</a></li>
