<ul>
  <li>
    <p>His ‘crime’, so-called, was that he resisted Nazis and Communist oppression and <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and was prepared to pay if necessary for that resistance with his life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was once warned as a younger man against the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of possessions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time in the countryside the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of possessions is very real because, although a person might have the assets on paper, he does not have the substance or the income, in fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, by lending their support and their names to these “Trojan” organisations within our ranks, they are bei’ng used as respectable fronts for sinister objectives, the ultimate overthrow of our democratic form of government, and ils replacement by a form of  governments  known for its absolute <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and totalitarianism’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the majority - a complete denial of the rights of the minority within a democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sixthly, we say that the Moratorium is wrong because it mentions the so-called corruption and <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> in South Vietnam but there is no mention of what is happening in North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> is more likely to occur where there are no elections and we know there are no elections in North Vietnam, but there are elections in South Vietnam in spite of every attempt made by the Vietcong to sabotage these elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Candidly, I do not think that in a democratic system we can do other than let the Executive take the initiative, but the Executive has to exercise its initiative with tolerance and without <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We fought for freedom from individual oppression and <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>, andI was proud to be an Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The possibility, remote as it seems now, is that the Chinese people may reject the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of life under Mao Tse Tung or whoever comes after him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is our standard of comparison we should be comparing also the disadvantages of what has been called, in a book of some consequence, the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance, lt is here; it is with us; it will not go away and it is absolutely basic to the high costs of providing comparable services, and even better services in some cases, in Australia than in other developed nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a free, non-party vote to be taken by members of the Parliament who not only want to sec the Parliament work efficiently but also want the Parliament to be a permanent safeguard for the people of Australia against <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>, despotism and the kind of abuse of power which governments sometimes take upon themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not matter how tyrannical the other side is; if they are not Communist it is all right to support them and their <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#debate-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in Tasmania they are intensified by physical isolation and the almost exclusive reliance on sea transport bringing in its wake the problems of what one writer has strikingly called the ‘<span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not tell me that the Government and the Australian people in general go around looking for people to free from <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and to protect their independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, order without freedom is <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and we will have none of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You submit to the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of words once you try to define a right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have lived under the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament’s members have enough difficulties through the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance, as somebody called it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tn other words, T am saying - and it is something we should all consider - that unions try to impose their own <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> on their own workers once they take the helm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that ultimately, if they keep on with these pressures, they will debauch the economy of Australia, they will impose then their own <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> on the workers of Australia and the end result will be that the workers will be losers, not management as we know it today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> in West Pakistan the Australian representatives sat with the Pakistani representatives at a SEATO council meeting but apparently they did not feel that the matter was worth raising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Men strike because <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and injustice have not yet disappeared from human affairs - they have merely shifted the venue - and because the spirit of freedom still lives and will not yield even to the law when the law becomes an instrument of class oppression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are to substitute a sense of wilfulness for the authority of Parliament, if you are to say: ‘I do not want to evade this law because I am opposed to if, you invite the people of this country to walk down the road to <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this because if we are going to stick with the cities - and I am afraid we are stuck with them and the greater population will be there for a long time to come whatever we do; that is not an argument for doing nothing because they will be there - then urban renewal in the inner areas of cities is a much more profitable enterprise than continued expansion at the periphery because the very fact of expansion at the periphery brings in, to turn a phrase, the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance which we have heard much of, and it much plagues economics and economies - the would-be economies - of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely what we are trying to do is to protect the men against the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the union machine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They want the Government to provide them with some protection against trade union <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is concerned with maintaining the coherence of the trade union machine which can become - it is not always so - a <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> over its members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members of the unions are naturally looking to the Government to protect them against the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of trade union officials, and that is what this Bill is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said in previous debates of this nature, and I again say unhesitatingly, that Parliament is one of the 2 main bulwarks we have against <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that members of that chamber, who apparently are more likely to defend their rights against the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of ignorance - that is exactly what it is - in fact are increasing their facilities at the expense of members of this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We subject ourselves to the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of words. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must use our <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance constructively by locating the sub-metropolitan centres at points intermediate between the cities and the regional growth centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had to get in first to show the world that we could have a first with East Germany, with these self-elected people, not appointed by the people of their country but self-appointed by <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>, force and a lack of freedom in taking over the role of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past when those people have gone to the United States of America, to Australia or to the Western democracies of Europe they have made every effort to get away from the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> that 1 have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know about the automatic devices used by the East Germans to maim, kill or terrorise those fugitives who desire to get away from the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> behind the Iron Curtain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And still there are fugitives who will take this form of action to escape from the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of these self-imposed leaders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only those who have experienced the privations of remoteness, the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance and the loneliness of the outback really understand the need for these factors to be taken into account when drawing boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any dramatic alteration of our electoral laws, as proposed here, will not alter the vital composition of this place as regards ideology or philosophy, but democracy will be threatened in that it will make for the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of a 2-party system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any parliament should have the desire to protect members of trade unions against that kind of <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an indictment of the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> that permeates the Cabinet which governs this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When Parliament does not operate freely and effectively the most important ingredient of democracy -  that is, free speech and liberty - is replaced by bullying and <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This great mass of people could no longer stand <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1944 he played a prominent part in the victory of the French and the rebuilding of France from Nazi <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things that the Committee of which I was a member did when it was in Darwin was to hear evidence from members of the Legislative Council about the future role of an autonomous local government in the Territory, lt caused me some degree of disquiet to hear the attitude of some of the elected members of the Legislative Council, because I fear that if their views are able to prevail in a future self-governing Northern Territory we might have a situation of <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> by the majority of the minority in 2 particular respects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the chamber are out to protect individual unionists from the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the corrupt left wing in the unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we are saying is that no 250 miserable unionists - I again use the Minister’s own phrase - should be made miserable by having to stand up against the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and intimidation of their own left wings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>life may have had the courage to stand up against the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet here he is coming to this place and abandoning the individual members of the unions to the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the organised left wing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this were an isolated case one could perhaps take’ less notice of it, but one knows that it is typical of the circumstances of millions who are suffering under Soviet <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Bad laws are the worst sort of <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that sense a form of <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> is brought about by that bad set of basic laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly the people of the less populous States look to the Senate as a States House to overcome the potential <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> inherent in the House of Representatives because the more populous States have the numbers in that House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the House is the lack of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We went into the Second World War to remove from Europe and from the world the naked oppression of the Nazi <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is why I now have a mandate for <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> by their definition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, I remind you of the phrase ‘The <span class="highlight">Tyranny</span> of Distance’ which is the title of a widely acclaimed book written by an old school mate of mine, Professor Geoffrey Blainey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘The <span class="highlight">Tyranny</span> of Distance’ is one of the great determinants affecting the social, political and economic development of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I can say is, Thank God for the Senate’, because in the Senate at least the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of numbers is not used and cannot be used to stifle debate in the way in which debate has been stifled and is being stifled in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the diplomats answered the questions very courteously by saying that more women worked in the Soviet Union that probably in any other country in the world, the reason being that when they were at war as our allies against the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of Nazi Fascism, so many of their men were in the fighting forces that it was necessary for the women to do the men’s jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No respectable nation could put up with that sort of autocracy, that sort of <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are not many places in the Constitution where the Governor has any powers as such, but again those powers, unless they are to be potential <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>, surely are meant to be exercised in the sense of ‘Governor-in-Council’, not the Governor as a paramount chief or trying to take to himself in 1976 powers that were discarded by the Crown in the United Kingdom almost 200 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government at a central and distant point can never be government by the people, and may be just as crushing a <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> under republican or commonwealth forms as under the most absolute monarchy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>not by governments but by private individuals, people willing to take risks, to face the dangers and difficulties of isolation and the ‘<span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance’, the apt tide of Professor Geoffrey Blainey’s recent book. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance emphasises the difficulties of living so far away from the main centres of population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance, the greatest problem in Leichhardt is communication in all its forms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my firm belief and the policy of the National Country Party that those who live in the more isolated areas of the nation should not be unduly disadvantaged by the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is particularly hard on the women of the outback, another instance of the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge all honourable members to go north and to see for themselves the problems imposed by the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance and to see also the vast potential of the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is a country of peculiar if not unique characteristics which puts it at some risk, at some definite handicap in maintaining a communications system under this <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance that we experience and the sparsity of population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is our task to see that Australia is a light in the darkness, a fortress of freedom, a refuge against the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> which could crush all men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a country as vast as ours where distances are so great, where we are subject to the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance, it is an utterly unacceptable proposition that the services of these 2 commissions should be operated on a user-pays basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trade unionists of this country must fight all forms of <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they permit the form of <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> to which this bill will give rise to stalk the country, sapping the life-blood of the trade union movement and the strength of the Labour movement, it will not be long before they will find themselves in the position in which their forebears were placed in 1890. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make a plea to the Government to give every consideration possible to those disadvantaged by isolation and the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance, such as the people in my electorate of Leichhardt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When such an allegation is made at a time when general revenue payments to the States have been increased by 20.3 per cent this year and when a small State such as Tasmania has received an increase in revenues of 20.8 per cent, representing an extra $3 8m this year and  $4.5m  more than would have been received, under the wretched Whitlam formula, as Secretary of the Liberal Party Federal Affairs Committee, I respond to the accusation from the Opposition that we are abdicating our policy on federalism by asserting that we are bringing the concept of federalism back to this country after 3 years of centralist, socialist <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we should appreciate from the outset that what we have done is not only to restore the federal system of government to this country but also to build into that system bulwarks which will prevent Australians from ever again being subjected to the 3 years of centralist <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> which they suffered under the Whitlam Government from 1972 to 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of false argument has been used to suggest that it was <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>, that in some way the power to govern had been assumed by the then Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among all the bogus examples from history about <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> only one is relevant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the suggestion that somehow or other the then Government might govern without Supply, like Charles I during the 11 year <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That country for over 30 years fought against the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and exploitation of foreign business and foreign imperialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Australia we face a <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance both within Australia and between Australia and the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Read that great book of history,  The Martyrdom of Man,  and see how the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the ruling classes was thrown off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as the IAC has said, when talking about changes which are taking place in our economy, there is a certain <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> in believing that we can live with the status quo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What can Australia do to resist policies of the United Nations moulded by what a former United States ambassador to the United Nations,  Mr Scali  described as the ‘<span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the majority’ which threatens the right of the individual country by acting to appease the communist bloc? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the cynical Liberal and National Country Party members, who have a big majority in this House, used their <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of numbers to drag this institution through the dirt in the way that they did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of this comes back to what honourable members opposite were doing- using <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of numbers to do something which should not have been done- to seek to incorporate that document in  Hansard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They want universal dominion on the part of the union, aided in some cases by <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again, in many cases the complaints will be from individual unionists who feel aggrieved at the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of their leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my mind this reinforces certain comments made about the power of the shop stewards, the usurping of constituted trade union authority, the British disease in this country, and articles written by Paul Johnson, that leading Labor Party intellectual in the United Kingdom, who contributed to the  New Statesman  on the new <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A large electorate such as Leichhardt suffers from the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance and, because of that, from very poor communications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last year there has been a number of Government initiatives which have helped to reduce that <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All in all, it is a very sad performance on the part of the Government if this is the best of which it is capable in trying to give some measure of justice to the people who live in distant areas and who live under the hardships or, as they say, the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance from the capital cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The moment democracy ceases to pay attention to the limitations and restraints which all governments must observe, it ceases to be a form of free government and becomes an organ of <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Liberal Government will never become an organ of <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> but the precedent we are setting provides the machinery for a future socialist government to act in a manner, according to the honourable member for Gellibrand, of passing legislation retrospectively, if necessary it says, up to several years retrospectivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must take into account such disabilities as the size of the Territory, its population, the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance which, as has been mentioned, operate on many aspects of the way in which people live in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law, <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people have started throwing bricks at this Government and they have shown that they appreciate the sermons of which Mark Twain spoke and which we on this side of the House have preached against the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of Fraserism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But if you don’t accept the sections of the Act that provide protection for a union ‘s membership against the possibly <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of their paid officials, and if you object to those laws which protect the ordinary plumber and gasfitter against rules that are ‘oppressive, unreasonable or unjust’, and which give him a legal right to force you to observe the union’s rules, then why don’t you try to persuade your members to allow your union’s registered rights to be taken over by some other organisation and try working outside the Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because we obviously have no territorial ambitions, because we have proved ourselves a people who, over the years, have resisted <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and oppression, because we are willing to share our resources, because we have shown our practical concern and compassion for homeless refugees, and because we have never been part of the ageold rivalries and historic arrangements concerning our Asian neighbours, we nave the capacity to act as an honest broker in an increasingly troubled area of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me suggest the following examples of market distortion by government interference or by business monopoly or union monopoly- I make no distinction- which are depriving Australians of benefits they should be enjoying, and where the position daily gets worse: Firstly, our whole transport system, where a population living almost entirely by the sea is denied by Government, business or union restrictive practices the full benefits of carriage by sea; where the economics of rail versus road are not even known because of numerous cross subsidies; and where competition in the air is stifled in the interest of one Government-owned and one Government-supported airline; and all this in a country suffering, as Blainey has said, The <span class="highlight">Tyranny</span> of Distance’, dependent for its very lifeblood on the cheapness of transport; secondly, the postal system where Government monopoly and feather bedding result in less and less service at higher and higher cost, and where the organisation of alternative methods of communication is prevented by force of law; thirdly, the restrictive framework of limited trading hours, weekend and holiday penalty rates and other protective devices that are, on the one hand, denying consumers the goods and services they have a right to expect and, on the other, denying those who are prepared to work the employment which they seek; and fourthly, a banking system so regulated and controlled that it is difficult to distinguish one bank from another, and in which nobody knows whether the system is responding to new demands or merely moulding its customers into the patterns of its own inertia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance which has for so long added considerably to the costs of running a farm or property will be significantly overcome by these cuts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, socialism works in devious ways and we have to show it for what it really is- a righteous rationalisation of totalitarian <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>, in the name of the collective well-being of the proletariat, race or fatherland and in the name of public interest, brotherhood and equality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its result is an inability to produce, the destruction of the economic life, grinding poverty and, of course, <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Similarly, one grasps the meaning and importance of freedom only when one confronts political <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
