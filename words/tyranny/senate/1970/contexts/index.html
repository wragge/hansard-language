<ul>
  <li>
    <p>On that occasion 1 warned that the inquiry should go beyond merely asking the staff whether certain things did or did not happen because my allegations, if against, anyone, were against some of the senior officials in the area and the staff might fear <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and oppression by senior officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The persecution, <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and injustice that is happening at Yuendumu today justifies the inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As he has said, and as we know, the great British system of justice which he now represents and advocates before the judiciary was founded mostly upon the illegal actions of those who revolted against <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and oppression in the early stages of British history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would regard it as <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and slavery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is wrong and a <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and against Christian charity to gaol young men who refuse to join the lottery of death and violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other band, order without freedom is <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> ‘ and we will have none of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, order without freedom is <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and we will have none of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator O’Byrne  said that the man’s widow came to see him and gave him examples of <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>, and distress he had suffered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government prove the sincerity of its stated opposition to apartheid by condemning this <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> against a churchman for his opposition to what the United Nations and world opinion in general regard as a crime against humanity? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government demonstrate the sincerity of its stated opposition to apartheid by condemning this <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> against a churchman for his opposition to what the United Nations Organisation, and world opinion in general, regards as a crime against humanity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this not a total record of <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not severe enough to establish the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>, that someone desires to impose over Public Service employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we all recognise that many people have come to this country to experience a freedom of living, a freedom from all the apparatus of <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and authoritarianism which characterises the Communist countries of this world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister take note that at meetings and demonstrations throughout Australia the gravest possible concern is being expressed by migrants to this country from behind the Iron Curtain at a revival, instigated by the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, of a system’ of repression, <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and deprivation of human rights such as one had hoped would have disappeared to some degree in those countries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recognising the unique knowledge and experience of Cardinal Mindszenty to report on the postwar tragedy of Hungary, will the Minister seek to obtain the full text of the Cardinal’s address and have it made available to this Parliament, the people of Australia and, particularly, to the thousands of Hungarian and other migrants in Australia who were forced to flee from behind the Iron Curtain, so that this country shall have a further and timely reminder of the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the communist military machine? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All have come with one common tragedy: They have been driven from their homes, they have been forced out by the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of communism, the military <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>, the bloody murder of communism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can take honourable senators to any one national group and show them freedom movements, liberation movements which are of course endemic to the group, because they all live with the hope that one day the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the Iron Curtain will end and they can be free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will be thoroughly interested to know that the national aspirations of human beings to seek freedom for their country from the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of communism is being rejected by the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only say from my knowledge of the history of the Labor Party  in  this country that the Labor Party never downed or attacked the right of  people  to  condemn  <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> in an overseas country  and it conceded  their right to form an organisation by peaceful means to advocate freedom in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of them have come here to escape communist <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>, and the honourable senator should know that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have spoken to hundreds of migrants who have told me that they came here to get away from communist <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you legislate for morality, you legislate for <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and that is silly and inefficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When Superintendent Milte put to Rover that Father Kasic advocates violence to free Croatia from Yugoslav <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>, Rover made the following statement: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the government of <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I want support for my arguments that today the Government is embracing <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and that it fails to understand the very conceptof democracy then the yells, screams and attempts to frustrate my speech from the honourable senators have provided that support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overwhelming majority of them are decent, dignified people who fled from <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, are similar measures contemplated for countries such as Uganda where political <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> is self evident? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the national heroes since then has been a young student named Jan Palach who, in 1969, gave up his life as a protest against the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> that had been imposed upon his country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When, this week, the fifth anniversary of the imposition of that <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> on Czechoslovakia by the Red Army came around, the Communist authorities in Prague erected around the cemetery where this young boy had been buried a 6- feet high fence and prohibited any Czechoslovak from going to the cemetery to put flowers upon the boy’s grave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Russia the mere fact that Grigorenko disagreed with the Soviet <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> was held to be proof of his insanity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It rightly condemns the aspects of apartheid and decides that it is not an internal matter for  South Africa;  then it runs away from the question of Russian <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> on the specious ground that it is an internal matter for the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prize winner, he issued last year a series of statements criticising Soviet society, its <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and its conformism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not weary you,  Mr President,  by attempting to pronounce a whole series of Russian names of men who have suffered or who were persecuted for their dislike of Soviet <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I have said enough and adduced enough to indicate that there is at least a prima facie case of repression and torture of dissidents in the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> that is known as the Soviet system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am indebted to Latey ‘s recent work entitled <span class="highlight">Tyranny</span>- A Study in the Abuse of Power’ which was published earlier this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is not only speaking out against the double standards, the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and the repression in Russia; he is also saying that in Australia and New Zealand similar techniques of propaganda, of the retention of information and of double standards are being applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is sad that a great man, a Russian, should have spoken out about the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of a country which I had hoped would have mellowed and would have moved to a detente. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though  Senator Murphy  at this moment will not be shedding a tear for what he calls the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of numbers- he can save his tears at this time because the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of numbers is working for him- I call upon the Senate to recognise that between now and the time when this Senate rises not only do we have to deal with a program of 100 or more pieces of legislation but also we have to consider some of the greatest domestic and foreign issues that this country has ever faced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chairman  Mao and his boys embody the same evils, the same brutality and the same <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the method, the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and the type of disgrace to humanity by which  Chairman  Mao and his friends have come to power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me remind honourable senators opposite that the Government which does the appointing is not some <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> imposed on the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He launched, with his colleague  Senator Murphy,  the most vigorous and unfounded persecution of the Croatian people in this country whose only crime is that they loathe the communist <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> that has been fastened upon their homeland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by saying that the Senate has performed in recent years a vital role as an independent chamber, as a House of review as a bulwark against authoritarianism and against the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of numbers which exists in the House of Representatives, in preventing the domination of the legislative chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But some honourable senators opposite say: ‘Oh, it is a dreadful <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> that the Australian Government is imposing upon us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the majority can be effective only if the people themselves refuse to take an interest and to show their interest in decisions that are being taken on their behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we allow the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of numbers in a House of government to force upon the Australian people a new system of diminished health care, we are handing to the Government of the day a system of administration of health care and not one of delivery of health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This demonstrates the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the kind of left wing socialism that we see here and that seeks to gag the democratic Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole 3 stages of a Bill are designed to prevent the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of a sudden pressurising of legislation through a chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bad laws are the worst son of <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that sense a form of <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> is brought about by that bad set of basic laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly the people of the less populous States look to the Senate as a States House to overcome the potential <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> inherent in the House of Representatives because the more populous States have the numbers in that House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a numbers game in which the Government revels now but in respect of which  Senator Murphy  saw more than wicked <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> in years gone by. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does anyone suggest that a free and democratic country- India- in incorporating Goa can offer to the Goanese the potential duress, the potential <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>, that Russia can offer to the Baltic states? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that it is possible to have a just society without the oppression that has been practised in the Soviet Union and we are not heard to condone the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> that is practised in that country on individuals or in Russia’s relationships with other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These people were driven across the world by cruel events and the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of a cruel invader. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This illustrates the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> which exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They reaffirmed to me on Torres Strait Island at the weekend the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> that exists as evidenced by the request from the Premier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Twenty-two telegrams were received, but as was exposed the other night, they were sent at the request of the very department which can bring about a resolution of this matter at the conference I am to attend by facilitating the expression of the opinion which one honourable senator said we will get from the Aboriginal people when they get away from the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> under which they find themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Deputy  Prime Minister of Australia is in favour of imposing on a peasant and free society a <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and terror that are part of the incredible tragedy of today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They came from lands of oppression and <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and when they got into the formal atmosphere of a court they thought it was the old times back again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are setting out to establish a machinery which will do something to mitigate the rigours of bureaucratic and ministerial, shall I say, <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the sort of double standard which enabled it to posture and pose as the champion of the liberty of the individual against the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the State while at the same time it was sending out press gangs to dragoon Australian youths into fighting a war in IndoChina, a war in which Australia had become involved on the basis of a tissue of lies circulated by  Senator Carrick  ‘s party and the Government formed by his party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely only a Party which waffles about personal freedom and protecting the rights of the individual against the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the State at the same time as it passes conscription Acts and at two of its <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to say to  Senator Wright  that democracy is the opposite of <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and oppression and to give way in this instance would be <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> in its worst form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a system that is opposed to the system of <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and oppression practised in the totalitarian states. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That means simply that loyalty, understanding and a love of people is necessary, as opposed to <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and oppression under other systems of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I was saying, the West has started to hit back, speaking of the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of this new majority and the need to challenge the coalition between the communists and the Third World. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of numbers prevailed again in relation to that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The years of Labor <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> left this country committed to a course that it is not the Australian people’s wish to pursue and that this country finds abhorrent in the extreme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But for the PSF and its determined commitment to democratic priniciples, Portugal would once again have receded into the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> it knew before, whether of the Right or of the Left. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope it does work and that we do not develop a new age of <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> by trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a world in which violence, intimidation, <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> and torture are growing each day and in which democracy is shrinking, we do not need people inciting violence; we need a bipartisan approach in this Senate and in another place to support these principles to our back teeth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that we should consider carefully all the theories that have ever been put forward on the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the majority before we say that those facts alone negate the right of the Senate to exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the majority, which was one of the very real practical fears of the founding fathers, was something which our founding fathers attempted to avoid in the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now we who oppose it are running the risk of the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The failure to think about this leads to educational <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> which is manifest in the classroom and the community at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Non-formal educationor forms of further education- can liberate man from the classroom and consequently its <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> over his life choices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the red boxes of which Richard Crossman wrote  (Mr Crosland was working on the boxes when he was struck down),  the constant apprehension that crisis is no more than a phone call away- these, added to the endless round of journeys, conferences, social engagements, speeches, questions in the House and the rest put even the toughest politicians under strain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think  Senator Harradine  correctly has shown that there already exists in the legislation ample protection for individual rights in the form of section 140 and section 141, which have been availed of by unionists over the years to protect themselves from any acts of <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> by union officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Government have mentioned in speeches in this House their disappointment at the inaction of the Government in accepting its responsibility towards the East Timorese people; the families of the 5 Australian journalists who were killed in East Timor; people like Jim Dunn and other people who have travelled to Portugal to get evidence from East Timorese who left their country, their homes and their families behind to live in some sort of freedom rather than live under the oppression of an Indonesian <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> which has taken over their country, and virtually stripped it of all the good and supplanted it with all the evil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I certainly congratulate the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia,  Mr Tonkin,  for the very fine campaign he is now leading to free South Australia from the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the Dunstan Government in relation to its shopping freedoms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance indeed still haunts us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At that time I was attempting to free the Queensland Aborigines on reserves from the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the Queensland Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is indecisiveness and compromise because the Federal Government does not really want to see these people free of the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he not agree again with the statement that he made in 1975 against the previous Government when he said that ‘refusal of information is the first step towards <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>’ and that a people denied information cannot judge the facts ‘? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They proclaim themselves to be the defenders of the liberty of the individual against the real or potential <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the State while simultaneously voting for the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the State for which confiscates the personal physical freedom or even the life of arbitrarily selected individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I regard a free, responsible Press as the greatest guarantee of our civil liberties- a bulwark against the potential <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of both politicians and judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe obtrusiveness of the mass media, with the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the mass audience over most of its content, and its control being in the hands of a mere handful of people, makes the development of public libraries all the more important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are involved in an exercise in which the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the majority will be imposed regardless of the arguments that the Opposition puts up, regardless of the public comment in the newspapers and in other areas of concern within the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we in Australia suffer from the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is committed to ending the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance’ within Australia it should ensure that the telecommunications network remains wholly publicly owned under the statutory authority best able to manage it- that is, Telecom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today we are witnessing the commencement of a railway which itself represents a further step toward overthrowing ‘the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of distance’ which has so long been a feature of Central Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we are going to be confronted with its passage because we have in the Parliament the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the majority, the inability of the minority of the members on that side of this chamber to do more than carry out the behest of their leader. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That can be a very simple formula for <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless there was a final power in the Senate to act against that, then what is called the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of numbers in the lower House would prevail and there would be a threat to the four less populous States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One is reminded of the oft-used phrase, the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the majority, the situation in which the majority rides rough-shod over the rights of the minority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If one examines the role of the Senate, of the Parliament itself- and one could probably include the State parliamentsone sees a growing example of the <span class="highlight">tyranny</span> of the majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any government which can alter its constitution unilaterally is a government of <span class="highlight">tyranny</span>, and I think human rights are justifiable if they are confined to the agreed amenities which the government is to provide for the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
