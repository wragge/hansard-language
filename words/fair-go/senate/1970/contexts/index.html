<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In education, in nutrition and in almost every aspect of life the Aboriginal people are not being given a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We used to pride ourselves that there was a fair distribution of wealth in Australia, that the Australian people, and especially their children, would have a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because I consider that ex-servicemen, particularly those returning from Vietnam, are not getting a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> in the matter of reestablishment opportunities that I am speaking on the motion for the adjournment this evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700407_senate_27_s43/#debate-101">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that this is the best system of seeing that all people have a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when the States are made so much aware of the fact that the Commonwealth debt has dropped while their debts are increasing and they are obliged out of their meagre resources to pay interest to the Commonwealth on moneys which the Commonwealth has collected from the areas of responsibility of the States, the Premiers have legitimate cause to complain that they are not getting a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to see the Government demand a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> from the United States and a return of the moneys which have been paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They listened to the evidence which was given to the Senate Select Committee and have waited in vain to hear that the average rank and file subscriber will get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> - never mind the susceptibilities of the fund directors or the Australian Medical Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interests of this country we should aim to keep the wheels of industry moving so that the mass of the people, the men we want to be connected with in life, get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget is not a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not militants; they are not radicals; they are Australians who assert their right to show the Government that they believe that they are not getting, and have not been getting, a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have tried religiously not to ask a question when it has been a question on notice in order to give the system a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we have to consider the young people and say: ‘Give them a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in a society such as ours, in which the Government claims to be generous with its social service payments, to be an example to other countries and to be giving our citizens a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>, much more emphasis should be placed on those who need government assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know that in the long term there is a price to be paid for these things, and all they are looking for is a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> and security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are prepared to sit extended hours, but we want a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, they too, were not given a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-36-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They might say: ‘Well, I am not getting a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> here so 1 will try the captain.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that the wool growers should get together, have a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> and get what they believe they are entitled to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also ask: What will the Government do about the request by that body that the subject matter should be put to the Trade Practices Commission to see to what extent some control might be exercised, in view of the fact that now the Australian Shipping Commission is part of the AustralianUnited Kingdom conference, to see that Australian producers get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Budget an allocation of $1, 137m is proposed for the defence services, yet we have nol found a means of giving serving members of the forces a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an example of inequality of opportunity being exacerbated and aggravated by this Government instead of the inequalities being modified in an endeavour to give children a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> as far as governments can do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the Government to take heed of my remarks and, certainly before the Senate election, to bring down recommendations regarding Australian content in television programmes because I believe that Australians engaged in this vital communications industry have not been given a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> to date by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not proposing now to refer to a debate that is closed, but I merely want to indicate that we moved in this chamber yesterday for some sort of public trust to be established to give Aboriginals a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The judgment of this country is that the pensioners are not getting a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-97-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many ways in which the Government could see to it that, with the immense resources of this country, which is one of the richest countries per head of population in the world, a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> was given to the pensioners and those people who are not able to look after themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-97-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am saying that we in this Parliament have to maintain a balanced responsibility in order to see that everybody gets a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-97-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am prompted to go a little further by  Senator Cavanagh  because on a number of occasions he has spoken about our arbitration system and the role of the State to see that at least a semblance of a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> is given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#debate-68">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But on the first day of the new session the Democratic Labor Party came into this place and said in effect, in terms to which one could not take exception, that it thought that the pensioners - all of them; age, invalid and widowed - were not getting a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> and that necessary legislation should be introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I allowed  Senator Little  to have a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>, but I must admit that I felt like interjecting and saying: ‘Look, you must be on the wrong Bill.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely if those companies believed that their 2 editors had not had a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> up to that stage, would not they have wanted to come and give further evidence on this matter to the Committee? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously their motive is not any sympathy with journalists or anybody who is not getting a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>; they are, I suspect, grandstanding for the media. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was their opportunity to pose as friends of the journalists, as people who want to see everybody get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the Minister to look very closely at the application by TAA so that that
          airline is given a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we members of the Australian Labor Party have said about the matter is that the Government has not given the pensioners of Australia a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> and that we would do better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the question was whether or not rugby league was getting a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> from the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am innocently and sincerely pursuing a persuasion I have, namely, that rugby league is not getting a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> in the way of television from the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I know, and as far as I can ascertain by examination of the problems that have been put before me, every airman has had a pretty <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If such a. person does not think he has had a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>, he can get someone to take up the case on his behalf and I will certainly have a look at it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that we have not had rules governing the calling and conduct of witnesses before a committee, with the possible exception of some rumours about Browne and Fitzpatrick there has never been an accusation that witnesses did not get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable senators to give  Senator Jessop,  who has the call, a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important thing is that the job which has to be done by the Queensland State Government, by the Premier, by the Minister for Conservation, Marine and Aboriginal Affairs and by the Director of Aboriginal and Island Affairs in that State is to give all 50,000 of the black people of Queensland a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can I have a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said: ‘We have had a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> in one direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do not think that TAA can fairly say that it has not had a pretty <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is that overseas companies seem to enjoy a pretty <span class="highlight">fair go</span>, and probably a little more than a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>, in respect of the money that is paid by way of these grants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> for these migrants? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> for the Australians who jostle with them in ever longer job queues? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that as members of the Opposition are given a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> it is only right that they should reciprocate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I object strongly to political censorship from either  side,  all that I argue for is a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He does not believe that we should get  a  <span class="highlight">fair go</span> on the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that the Government has ever asked for is a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>, an application  of  what the Americans call, under the Federal Communications Commission, the implementation of the fairness doctrine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I then asked him, in order to ensure that there was a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> for all political parties: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worth finding out what he means by some extremists’ -  that there is something legitimate about wanting to set up an independent government, self determination for a people, there’s something legitimate about saying that the Palestinian Arabs have got to get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> and can’t be left in poverty the way they are - neglected by everybody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government recognised that they had a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> in the length of time that they were there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that both  Senator Webster  and  Senator Laucke  were sufficiently aware of the criticism by the Australian Labor Party in relation to this matter to conclude that Australian industry has not been given a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> in connection with the provision of pipes for this project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, far from opposing this Bill in any way, the Opposition proudly accepts it as part of the program for which it has always stood and continues to stand- that is, the importance to Australia and the world of a migrant program and the importance to the people who play their part in that program of being able to obtain a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a general recognition that in the administration of the arts there is such a sensitive area involved that in its attempts to get off the ground the Australia Council should be given that minimum requirement of Australian culture, namely, a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Reiterating the point that was made in the second reading debate, we believe that the man who is to be the Commissioner of Community Relations,  Mr Grassby,  has shown by conduct and action that there will arise in the minds of some who could well be affected by this legislation the feeling that he has an antagonism to them which would lead them to believe that they could not get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> from him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is high time that the Government stopped being a pacesetter and settled down to seeing that everybody in this country gets a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> and that should extend, first of all, to the taxpayers, who should be treated in some consideration of equality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We on the Opposition side will, of course, be saying to the trade union movement, which gave us for most of the time a pretty <span class="highlight">fair go</span> indeed because it had the lowest inflation rate the world had seen, the highest sustained level of employment and the highest home ownership rate: ‘Look, we want a proper arrangement and a proper understanding’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have a great feeling for fairness, and although people sneer at the principle of one vote one value, I believe that the ordinary people of this country are closer to understanding the principle of a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> for everybody than are their representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed the Government, having had the opportunity to continue, having been given what it asked for- namely, a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>, a chance to do the things that it maintained it was capable of doing and determined to do on behalf of the total Australian people- has, 1 8 months later, as a result of its policies and as a result of its legislation, put the country in a considerably worse circumstance than it was in previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have not been able to understand that the Australian people are interested in a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> for a government, that they are interested in the democratic processes with which the Labor Party has been associated ever since it was formed in 1 89 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can say only in the circumstances in which this country is placed that he is not giving the people a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> by giving them an opportunity to decide whether he is to continue in government or whether the Opposition is to be given an opportunity to see whether it can do better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If any single, powerful pressure group in this country believes that it is being sold down the drain, that it is not getting a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> or that favours are being given to one section rather than to another section, the fight against inflation is doomed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nonetheless I believe that if we do not continue wage indexation for the period ahead, if we do not persuade the unions, as I agree that  Mr Fraser  and  Mr Street  managed to persuade them, that they will get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> from this Government, we can kiss the fight against inflation goodbye. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are thinking that the bugles, the brass bands and, if you like the buns and the biscuits are brought out when a conservative government is elected to office but that when a Labor government is elected to office, especially if it does not have a majority in the upper chamber, the Labor government is not to be given a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> by the establishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But when we do not get a thrashing and when we do have a win we expect a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> and our supporters- the people who voted for us and the people who work for us- expect us to be given a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was also a moment of recognition of the fact that Australia is a country of a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>, a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> for everyone, regardless of his origin, a country which millions of migrants like myself have adopted as their home and as the home of their children and their children’s children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me state this clearly: In the knowledge that this year there is to be $ 140m for both  per capita  grants and equalisation, and in the knowledge that last year there was $79.9m for equalisation, if everybody was to get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> and nobody could get less from equalisation than was received last year, with costs having been adjusted, one would not want to give more than 40 per cent to  per capita  grants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
