<ul>
  <li>
    <p>However, 1 am moved to reply to ray friend, the honourable member for Purl Adelaide  (Mr Birrell)  who put up an argument that we often hear in this place that the workers do not get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> and that other people in the community get a much greater share. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there ought to be something of a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>, if I may put it that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member for Blaxland  (Mr Keating)  wants to correct the position, he should appeal to the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  and to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Barnard)  not to ask so many questions and to give back bench members of the Opposition a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am keeping a good tally to ensure that all Parties get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On numerous occasions I have had requests from the Opposition that more questions should be asked in a day to give the backbenchers a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>- if I may use that expression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the short period that I have been a member of this House they have taken advantage of the very <span class="highlight">fair go</span> they have been given not only by this side of the House but also by your predecessor,  Mr Speaker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable members who really believe in a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> for people living in country areas to vote with us on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest that honourable members opposite should not argue the point about not getting a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that if New South Wales was being given a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> by the Postmaster-General in the matter of finance, equipment and the rest, that State would have only 38.8% of deferred applications instead of 65%. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Matters of definite public importance in the last Parliament had a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> and if the Government regards those matters as irresponsible it is perfectly competent for it to say why. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that we are asking is that the Government give us a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Acting Prime Minister was given a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give them a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It stands by the wealthy sector of the community and will not give the credit unions a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It affected their make-up psychologically to the extent that they have not had a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> in life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we are asking for is a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> for the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not giving us a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think this is a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us come here for a 3 day week and, above all, let us have a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> at the bureaucracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, as I firmly believe, they stand for justice, for the <span class="highlight">fair go</span>, they will throw out this disgraceful Budget and with it throw out this discredited Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what the Government calls a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I want is a little fair play, a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> and a little equality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shame on the Government which tolerates such conditions and shame on any Minister who denies to any worker the right to fight for a decent <span class="highlight">fair go</span> in Australian terms for himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that the individual member of the staff of this House should be given a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that tonight they will be just as self-righteous and will show some consideration for the people who are not getting a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> if staff have to miss out on a meal because members of Parliament are having a function in the official dining room. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am one of those who feel that in many instances ex-servicemen do not get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700918_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government is not giving a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> to the Australian owned company R. W. Miller. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#debate-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reasoning behind this section is very similar to the reasoning that lies behind the sub judice rule in courts of law - which is to ensure that justice appears to be done, and that the parties appearing appear to get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>, that the tribunal itself is protected and not subjected to pressures, because if it has to make a decision, and it has to make a decision sooner or later, it must appear, above all else, that when it does give that decision, it is made on the evidence before it and the submissions that are put to it and which can be answered before it; and not by what someone like the Prime Minister or any other Minister has said outside the tribunal and which cannot be answered before the tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it adopted that course of action the farmers of Australia would get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> and would not be subjected to the disadvantages of the present iniquitous system that this Government has implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701027_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is very grateful to all the people who come to this country and trade but it certainly looks for a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is - this cannot be denied; it has been proved too often in the past and nothing has happened to alter it - that the wool grower is being denied, and in fact is being cheated out of, a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> on the auction floor by the collusion amongst the wool buyers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-37-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that it wants is a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, they will help us retain our national identity of concern for the underdog in which an essential part of the <span class="highlight">fair go</span> outlook is that each individual is also’ responsible for his mate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am putting the point of view that you have denied members of the Opposition any right to a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a decision has been made, a prisoner can have no valid reason in those circumstances to suppose that he has not had a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> or that he has not had fair treatment because justice has manifestly been seen to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No prisoner who is refused parole will believe that justice has been done to him or that he has had a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> when he knows that the decision on whether he would be released was in the hands of people whom he does not know, who probably are unknowable to him and whose decisions he cannot influence, but who in his mind are associated with Crown prosecutors and police prosecutors who helped to put him in gaol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have to help them to reconstruct in the country and to see that they get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the short time left to me I will read a little of an actual transcript of a Crown Solicitor’s questions which shows that some ot these people are not receiving a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our adversary system of justice is not an inquisitorial system; it does not seek to find out what actually happened - it seeks to give a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I realise that I am not dealing with a function of the Department of Immigration, but surely it is concerned about the way migrants look at Australia and their expectations, whether they feel that Australia is giving them a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should give a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> to people who live in houses built by a public authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, those young Turks who in 1950-51 were making sure that their comrades who served in the war would get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>, are silent today except for some crocodile tears. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Women have had less of a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> than have young men: people in industrial areas have had fewer opportunities than those in nonindustrial areas; people in country districts have had much less access to higher education than those in a city; people in Victoria had much less access to higher education than people in New South Wales; and Aboriginal people have still not achieved the same equality or anywhere near it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak as a member of this Parliament who likes to see a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> and who likes to see a company like BHP and other companies which are big and successful and which are doing a good job for the thousands of workers that they employ aided and abetted by any government, whether it be the government that presently holds office or any other government that may hold office in the far distant future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have had a very <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720301_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have had a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> at the wicket and now if by some machinations of private enterprise it happens that their interests contravene the Act, they should sell out what is over the prescribed interest: and if this takes them below the limit they should have no right to buy back above the prescribed interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720301_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mass media does not give the Opposition a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> but the Opposition still goes very close to the Government in elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720301_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the industry went to Japan and said: ‘Look, we are not getting a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we have found our way as a nation, the background, cultures and particularly the religions of our settlers have helped us to pick up a uniquely Australian identity and at the heart of this there is the belief in tolerance, a belief in a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> and a belief in diversity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not interested to see whether children get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> but merely to ensure that it can push its own barrow on the question of education, particularly in respect of non-denomination schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The whole Australian character is built on the idea that you give a man a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> and a chance to put his point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is that a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> for the community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is time the pendulum swung the other way, that we dispensed with the catch cry ‘Cheap bread for the people at the farmers’ expense’ and we adopted the slogan ‘A <span class="highlight">fair go</span> for the Aus.tralian farmer’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe, and I would say that the Liberal Party of Australia believes, that the laws of this country should be such that they allow all people involved in employment a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> so that they have no hesitation in applying to a court and feel no restriction in applying to a court and they do not wish to be dominated in any way, as the Builders Labourers Federation portends to do in this case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It ought to have seen then that the reductions were going to be necessary, that it was going to be equitable to reduce tax, for reasons which I will come to, and ought not to have been pushed into it, reluctant to give individual taxpayers what the man in the street would call and recognise as a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our Prime Minister appeals for a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>- a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> for himself- but he does not consider that he should give everybody else a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>, or even our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Life is naturally competitive and we must argue that everybody should get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> but that they must demonstrate in the end that they have energy, ability and those other qualities that entitle them to take their place in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I think all members in this Parliament must give credit to the drive, initiative and inspiration of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in giving men like Mollison and the men who are now in charge of the gallery a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> and the moral support that is necessary to make it a great gallery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our country selected refugees who were least likely to be selected by other countries, people who did not have recognised skills and who normally would not be eligible for entry to Australia, people who were caught in a morass of social upheaval and degradation, people given the opportunity- to use a good Australian expression- to have a ‘<span class="highlight">fair go</span>’, which is something the Liberal governments during their 23 years of rule, were loath to give the vast majority of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead of attempting to confuse and to frighten people for its own political motives, the Opposition should get wholeheartedly behind Medibank and ensure that Medibank ‘s new fund has a fair chance and a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The commission that was set up by the Whitlam Labor Government set out to do just that- to expose the inequalities within that industry and try to put it on a decent footing whereby the Australian motorist, the user of the fuel and oil would at least get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What happened at that time was that the then Prime Minister, who has so much to say today about judges over 70 years of age still being capable, went into the Commission and argued with the employers for abolition of cost of living adjustments which gave the workers a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In any case the honourable member for Lilley, in March, asked the Prime Minister for some assurances, assurances which to some people would amount to a statement, that the non-government sector would receive a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> in the allocation of money for education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the most notable differences in the attitude of the present Government to Tasmanian industry and to the State of Tasmania in general is that for the first time this Government was prepared to bring in a new federalism policy under which our State would get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a matter of record that this Government not only believes in federalism but also believes in the smallest State getting a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>, contrary to the policies of our opponents and contrary to the treatment that they meted out to Tasmania between 1972 and 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, any proposition that is put forward concerning economic growth in Australia will be judged on one overwhelming aspect- namely, is it fair; does it distribute fairly; does everybody get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One does not have to be a fan of Charles Dickens to understand that and one does not have to read  Hard Times  to realise that democratic electorates, whether in Great Britain or in Australia, will reject any party that does not seek to say: ‘ We will give you a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So any party in Australia that departs from giving a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>, from making a fair distribution of resources in Australia, whether it be under doctrines of socialism or whether it be under doctrines of social justice, will be rejected and it certainly deserves and ought to be rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They treat me as a normal politician and give me a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>, and that is all I want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Health, his Press secretary and private secretary are not given a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> to try to explain things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is opposing wage indexation and the Prices Justification Tribunal and it is doing everything to belittle every chance that the working man has to get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite are not prepared to stand up for the Australian working people, who deserve a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it any wonder that they think the whole system is anomalous and that they are not given a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there is no opposition to the legislation but I honestly believe that something has to be done to determine what is a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I submit- I agree with the honourable member for Blaxland on this point-that the Atomic Energy Act has not yet been effectively amended to provide that mining companies get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Give Queensland a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> or else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the basis of a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> for all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The committee system means that the uniformed elements do not get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> when discussions on important matters are held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have not given the Minister for the Capital Territory a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> on the Council and they have stubbornly refused to increase the quotas of producers in the Australian Capital Territory so that they can dump their surplus eggs in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have made the point that Canberra producers have not had a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> in relation to eggs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It should be the ombudsman of the Aborigines to ensure that they get a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> from all authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all these areas the Government has inflicted unnecessary hardship upon those who most deserve a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>, and it should be condemned for its actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they were offended by it, if they thought it was unjust, I have no doubt that the capable officers representing the public servants of Australia would have risen in rage and said that they were not getting a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Maybe I could just interpose here that this is not just a question of a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> for the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the matter of a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> for the Australian people, who have a Minister like this involved in the affairs of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have cries from Opposition members in the name of decency, a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> and doing the right thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So this is simply about a very important parliamentary principle, a principle that is designed to enable proper parliamentary scrutiny of Ministers, but at the same time to give to Ministers, in the words that members of the Opposition have used in this debate, ‘ a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> ‘. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">fair go</span> ‘ means that if members of the Opposition have a complaint against the Leader of the House or against any other member of the Government front bench, they should move a substantive motion and have the courage to give particulars of their charge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We note your comments concerning the lack of Rugby League scores on the ABC in Melbourne in comparison to what you have considered to be a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> for Australian Rules scores on the ABC in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will defend the Prime Minister on this for one reason only and that is because his reason for doing this- as it has been with other Ministers- has been to ensure that the honourable member gets a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government should take some action to ensure that the rights of the merchant seamen who served this country during the Second World War are protected and that they are given a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having just lamented and complained that they were not given a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> to discuss the Estimates, not one member of the Opposition is here in the chamber to discuss them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that people listening are aware of the fact that it is unprecedented in my time in this House that not one member of the Labor Party is in the chamber to discuss these enormous Estimates about which they have been so critical and about which such phoney crocodile tears have just been shed because they were not given a fair chance, a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> to discuss them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Introducing the health policy proposals yesterday, the Opposition spokesman on health,  Dr Klugman,  said Medibank had never been given a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact this is particularly so among rural incomes where, thank heavens, after years of Labor repression at last the rural sector is getting a <span class="highlight">fair go</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because it is getting a <span class="highlight">fair go</span> and reasonable incomes the tax has gone up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
