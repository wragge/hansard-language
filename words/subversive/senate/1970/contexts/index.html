<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the document is not <span class="highlight">subversive</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increases in establishment have been necessary from time to time for a variety of reasons, but in general the increases have been necessary to ensure that the Force is able to meet the heavier demands being made on it, particularly in the fields of security, both personal and property; crime intelligence as related to national groups, <span class="highlight">subversive</span> organisations, organised crime and drug trafficking; and airport surveillance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the AttorneyGeneral make a considered statement to Parliament on information available to him regarding the plans of an organisation described as a moratorium to organise activities and demonstrations of a violent and <span class="highlight">subversive</span> character culminating in May of this year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although  Mr Agnew  and the extreme people inside the Republican Party - I regard them as the worst people inside the Republican Party - have attacked a number of people inside the peace movement, inside the Vietnam moratorium and inside the Vietnam mobilisation, they have not had the audacity to accuse  Senator McGovern, Mr Lindsay, Senator McCarthy  or Professor Galbraith, a former United States Ambassador to India under  President  Kennedy, or  Mr Moyes,  a former special adviser to  President  Johnson and one of the national organisers of the Vietnam mobilisation and the Vietnam moratorium, of in any way being treacherous or <span class="highlight">subversive</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of them - not  Mr Nixon  nor  Mr Agnew  - has ever tried to brand  Senator Cranston  or  Senator McGovern  or  Mr Lindsay  or Professor Galbraith or anybody else like that of being <span class="highlight">subversive</span> or treacherous, or a Communist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the endeavour which is being made to intimidate people out of exercising ordinary democratic rights by accusing them of being parties to violence, of being treacherous and of being <span class="highlight">subversive</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was accused by  Senator Wheeldon  of having said that people, amongst them members of the Senate, were treacherous and <span class="highlight">subversive</span> and had engaged in character assassination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are going to be any <span class="highlight">subversive</span> elements, they are going to come in through Malaysia; they are not going to come through Singapore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Communist powers extend the national interest by all means at their disposal by internal subversion, limited wars, nuclear blackmail, armed intervention and the creation of <span class="highlight">subversive</span> elements inside the countries they wish to reduce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never once has any allegation been made by any responsible American administration spokesman that  Senator Cranston, Senator McGovern,  Mayor Lindsay or Professor Galbraith,  President  Kennedy’s former Ambassador to the United Nations, are in some way <span class="highlight">subversive</span> or are trying to undermine the American way of life, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How docs the Government salve its conscious when it introduces laws which require its citizens to fight and possibly to die in battle against the forces of the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese and yet takes no action to rid the community of such <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activity as I have mentioned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think I have ever heard a more <span class="highlight">subversive</span> comment in this Parliament than that uttered by  Senator Cavanagh  a few minutes ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot think of a more <span class="highlight">subversive</span> comment to be made by a member of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">subversive</span> comments of  Senator Cavanagh  a few minutes ago are directed against the security of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a <span class="highlight">subversive</span> march by people who hold that type of standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, you will achieve everything that  Senator Cavanagh  and every other <span class="highlight">subversive</span> senator in this House wishes to bring about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘<span class="highlight">Subversive</span>’ is a very offensive word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Webster,  you referred to  Senator Cavanagh  or any other <span class="highlight">subversive</span> senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  would like to know whether you are using the word ‘<span class="highlight">subversive</span>’ in relation to any particular senator or whether you are using the word directly in relation to  Senator Cavanagh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ACTING  DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Davidson)  - I gathered from  Senator Webster’s  remarks a few moments ago that he said if the word ‘<span class="highlight">subversive</span>’ offended, he was prepared to withdraw it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ACTING  DEPUTY PRESIDENT  - You said that if the word ‘<span class="highlight">subversive</span>’ offended, you would be prepared to withdraw it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although such action is, perhaps, considered comical when it is taken in the grounds of a university, it certainly is a most serious matter if we, as a government, allow such <span class="highlight">subversive</span> action as the raising of the standard of an enemy power and the carrying of it down the main streets of Australia when we arc directing lads to war under the National Service Act and when we are spending so much of this country’s resources$1,100m in the last Budget in an attempt to preserve the defence of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May 1 point out to  Senator Webster  that the carrying of the Vietcong flag, which he considers to be <span class="highlight">subversive</span> and a crime, is not a <span class="highlight">subversive</span> aci? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is no <span class="highlight">subversive</span> act because we have never indicated that we were in a state of war with North Vietnam or with the Vietcong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the honourable senator suggest that this is a <span class="highlight">subversive</span> act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this a <span class="highlight">subversive</span> act on the part of  Her  Majesty’s Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not argue that because your ultimate purpose is to obtain peace for the aggrandisement of our enemy you refute the argument that those who carry the Vietcong flag along Australian streets are guilty of <span class="highlight">subversive</span> conduct of the most shameful and abhorrent kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Webster  today referred to  ‘Senator Cavanagh  and other <span class="highlight">subversive</span> senators’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we suggest that the United States Hag is losing some of its popularity throughout the world we are accused of being <span class="highlight">subversive</span> and of being all kinds of nasty people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I am making is that if he had a Vietcong flag, why did not honourable senators opposite accuse him of being <span class="highlight">subversive</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I make is that the flags which honourable members opposite said were so <span class="highlight">subversive</span> were home made flags. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is to be said that because members of the Australian Labor Party are opposed to the American intervention in Cambodia we are treacherous and we are <span class="highlight">subversive</span>, the Government will have to concede that a majority of the members of the United States Senate also are treacherous and <span class="highlight">subversive</span> because the viewpoint of the Australian Labor Party - the viewpoint of honourable senators sitting in opposition in this chamber - on the American intervention in Cambodia is the same as the viewpoint of a majority of members of the United States Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We keep just pinpricking here and there all over the place and by <span class="highlight">subversive</span> means we can win this war in Paris.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By <span class="highlight">subversive</span> means we can win this war in Washington.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I came to the Senate I never believed that 1 should hear words such as ‘traitor’, <span class="highlight">subversive</span>’ or ‘treachery’ being used against members of this national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that one is almost regarded as <span class="highlight">subversive</span> if one has the temerity to question the motives of  Mr Turner  or some of the hierarchy of the Australian Medical Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously it would be completely <span class="highlight">subversive</span> of his duty to represent the community - the duty which a member of parliament undertakes when he is elected to parliament - if his right of freedom of speech were to be restricted or .subordinated by a party caucus or junta, unelected by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am reminded that at the time of the referendum our powers to deal with <span class="highlight">subversive</span> bodies a Polish member of the Communist Party named Gerhardt Eisler was involved in a problem in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>28 stamp on my visa which meant that I was to be subjected to particular scrutiny as a <span class="highlight">subversive</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I give the House and the electorate at large an assurance here and now - these <span class="highlight">subversive</span> elements will be closely watched by my Government in the future and their activities against decency and democracy exposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I am stating is that I attended a conference here in Canberra and I was not in any way <span class="highlight">subversive</span> or disloyal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one on either side of the chamber would deny the desirability of having democracy in Greece or in any other place, yet according to  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  this is an indication of subversiveness and disloyalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that 2 senators of this Commonwealth, each with distinguished records in the Labor movement of this country, have been attacked as being <span class="highlight">subversive</span> and disloyal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most significant part of  Senator Greenwood’s  speech was his repudiation on 2 occasions of what  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  said, that is, that either of these senators were <span class="highlight">subversive</span> or disloyal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said by the Premier of Queensland that it is <span class="highlight">subversive</span>, disloyal and engaging in undemocratic and anti-democratic activities for the 2 senators to be associated with the Vietnam Moratorium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is suggested that people who associated themselves with those Moratorium rallies were in any way indulging in anti-democratic activities or any activity which is <span class="highlight">subversive</span> or disloyal then I think the Liberal Party or the Country Party which makes this charge is going to have a little difficulty in explaining how it is that organisations such as the Catholic Church have allowed their members to be associated with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he to be accused of being <span class="highlight">subversive</span> and disloyal and of engaging in anti-democratic activities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  is correct then I say it is the responsibility of the Government to charge these two senators with <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">subversive</span> elements will be closely watched by my Government in the future and their activities against decency and the democracy exposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can we as members of the national Parliament accept such a challenge from the Premier of Queensland that we have <span class="highlight">subversive</span> influences, <span class="highlight">subversive</span> elements, within our midst? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the evidence that has been displayed in this document is completely the reverse of what has been said about <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never known them to be <span class="highlight">subversive</span> in their activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would deny to them the right to be <span class="highlight">subversive</span>  in  their activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I close on this note: I believe that this Senate has  been  offered an insult by the Premier of Queensland who has charged 2 honourable senators with being <span class="highlight">subversive</span> elements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the powers of the Commonwealth Government to prevent such anarchy and <span class="highlight">subversive</span> actions from taking place and disrupting the every-day lives of the people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Disobedience of a military order is <span class="highlight">subversive</span> to the whole idea of defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister is using the word ‘<span class="highlight">subversive</span>’ in relation to the Leader of the Opposition in the other House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has said that the advice in question would be <span class="highlight">subversive</span> and would amount to treachery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But,  Mr President,  the words I used were that advice of this sort was seriously <span class="highlight">subversive</span> to the discipline which alone in the armed forces could create effective defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make it quite clear that I am referring to <span class="highlight">subversive</span> statements by  Mr Whitlam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is anything more <span class="highlight">subversive</span> of military discipline I would like to know it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then offered the puerile suggestion that I should be precluded by some standing order of this House from saying that that is seriously <span class="highlight">subversive</span> of the discipline that underlies the effectiveness of the armed forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is applicable, as I suggest it is, how moderate I was in confining myself to it when referring to activities which are seriously <span class="highlight">subversive</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister then indicated that it was a statement which in his opinion was <span class="highlight">subversive</span> of that which underlies discipline in the military forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thereafter the Minister again referred to precise words which were used by  Mr Whitlarn  and he indicated again that those words were <span class="highlight">subversive</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is advice which, as  Senator Wright  said, is <span class="highlight">subversive</span> of military discipline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wright  said that  Mr Whitlam  used words which were <span class="highlight">subversive</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wright,  replying to a question asked by  Senator Rae,  said that  Mr Whitlam  had used <span class="highlight">subversive</span> words. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say with respect that to use the words <span class="highlight">subversive</span>’ and ‘treacherous’, tacked on to what  Senator Withers  said - and I do not want to be unfair, God forbid, and misquote him, but I forget his words - is offensive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I said that  Senator Wright  used <span class="highlight">subversive</span> words or words that one could consider to be <span class="highlight">subversive</span>, I believe that you,  Mr President,  would be quite in order in pulling me up, because if I used those words I would be contravening standing order 418. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wright  said that in his view it was seriously <span class="highlight">subversive</span> to military discipline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On one occasion the statements were described as <span class="highlight">subversive</span> of army discipline and on a later occasion, when I intervened, as I clearly recall it, there was reference to the statement by  Mr Whitlam  as being clearly <span class="highlight">subversive</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I recall it the honourable senator did not even go on to add the qualification ‘<span class="highlight">Subversive</span> to military discipline’ but said that it was a <span class="highlight">subversive</span> statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly here, in the same way, to describe a statement as <span class="highlight">subversive</span> is to make a reflection on the person named as having made the statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The introduction of radical and <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activities do little other than add to this burden and can constitute a definite hindrance to the progress of Aboriginal Queenslanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we see that immediately considerable criticism is directed against the Queensland Act and the Queensland Department, that criticism is described as being the introduction of radical and <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activities which do little to assist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This man considers all or most activities on behalf of people from the south as <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did  Mrs Dalton  on 17th December 1967 warn Commonwealth Police Headquarters  of  the imminent danger to a senior parliamentarian from <span class="highlight">subversive</span> sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reply to the question whether  Mrs Dalton,  warned Commonwealth Police Headquarters of the imminent danger to a senior parliamentarian from <span class="highlight">subversive</span> sources, the AttorneyGeneral said she did not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What, steps does this Government propose to take to stop government money being so channelled into <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activities designed not only to kill Australian soldiers whom the Government has committed in Vietnam but also to promote the NLF aggression in Laos, Cambodia and Thailand? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that if no-one is going to invade us we need the army in our own defence against the <span class="highlight">subversive</span> forces which are operating in Australia at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an attitude which is completely <span class="highlight">subversive</span> to every fundamental principle of parliamentary democracy as well as being <span class="highlight">subversive</span> to the security of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is undeniable that nations to the north of Australia are targets for <span class="highlight">subversive</span> attack coming from the north. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">subversive</span> attack threatens the independence of those nations and, insofar as it threatens their independence, it poses a threat to the security of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a <span class="highlight">subversive</span> threat from the north of which these nations are conscious and of which they are extraordinarily afraid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Gair  has informed me that he had referred to the Petrov Commission and its revelations of <span class="highlight">subversive</span> influences atthe Russian Embassy and that he had no evidence to suggest that the position today is any different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We spoke of the continuing danger of Communist <span class="highlight">subversive</span> and insurgent activities throughout the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If members of Parliament take the oath to the Crown to administer the laws of the country, and then if E. G. Whitlam, Q.C., Leader of the Opposition in another place, puts forth this poisonous <span class="highlight">subversive</span> matter, then the attitude that the Labor Party adopts should be well known throughout the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-62-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although  Senator Cavanagh  has referred to a matter of national service 1 do not feel that the dignity of the House calls upon me to refute the <span class="highlight">subversive</span> remark by which he ended his tedious submission to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reports were to the effect that the aforesaid William Hartley was one of the students, that the discarded official of the Australian Labor Party now occupies the role of a pseudo student, and that in the interests of a <span class="highlight">subversive</span> minority group he now is carrying on the left wing Labor policy of preventing, within the educational institution, the great body of purposeful students from getting the instruction to which they are entitled and of preventing the great body of dedicated staff from fulfilling their proper educational functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly, monopoly power within the unions should be resisted, as it should be in every other aspect of national life, especially when it is sought and used for <span class="highlight">subversive</span> purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also regard it as <span class="highlight">subversive</span> of all constituted authority - the authority of parents, the home and the school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of that statement is <span class="highlight">subversive</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are groups in this country engaged in training for terrorist or <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activities - to be carried out either in this country or overseas - they will not be tolerated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one refers to Professor Lauterpacht, he takes the view that the only duty is one to suppress such <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activity against foreign governments as assumes the form of armed hostile expeditions or attempts to commit common crimes against life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have provided sufficient, I think, to indicate to the Senate not only that a committee of the Senate is a highly inappropriate body to conduct this inquiry and not only is the time inappropriate and likely to cause problems for other investigations which are being carried out, but also that on a factual basis there is no reason for supposing that what is alleged by Yugoslavia has any foundation in the light of the investigations which have been so painstakingly carried out by the police and which have not been given support to these allegations of training ranges, storage places for weapons and <span class="highlight">subversive</span> material for criminal activity against Yugoslavia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All allegations to this effect will be investigated and the position is the same irrespective of whether it is a supposed secret police organisation or a group of people training in this country to undertake <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activities outside this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to be a strange form of insanity, along the lines of recent publications which are deliberately <span class="highlight">subversive</span> of respect for authority even at the school stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are groups in this country engaged in training for terrorist or <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activities - to be carried out either in this country or overseas - they would not be tolerated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not want another example of the attitude expressed by the wartime Labor government on civil rights when individuals were detained not because of any evidence that they were engaged in <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activities but because they were thought to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He proceeded not to lay before us in an objective fashion or in an analytical fashion a closely reasoned proposition which showed that the documents in his possession and in his Department’s possession prove either that there is a <span class="highlight">subversive</span> organisation of Croatians operating in Australia or that particular Croatians have been guilty of <span class="highlight">subversive</span> utterances in relation to Yugoslavia, but he took selective excerpts from those documents and used them with dishonest distortion unprecedented, in my experience, by any lawyer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greatest crime which  Senator Greenwood  could have committed against the agencies - it was his responsibility to guide them in the successful prosecution of terrorist activity in Australia - would have been to disclose prematurely that evidence and to ruin any prospect of the further successful gathering of evidence by the Commonwealth Police that would enable it finally to get evidence, if it were available, to prove in a court of law that there was a criminal organisation or that there was criminal <span class="highlight">subversive</span> action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that some 18 years ago a series of royal commissions - first one and subsequently others - found that there was in this country a <span class="highlight">subversive</span> organisation called the Communist Party of Australia which trained terrorists in this country, which prevented ammunition from being shipped to our troops overseas, which had <span class="highlight">subversive</span> documents, and which had training camps at Minto run by Ernie Thornton and which was set to overthrow the whole of democratic government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the results of our security investigations were published, the attempt to defeat <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activities would always be foiled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did not the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation documents tabled in the Senate include the names of these 3 terrorists suspected of being involved in <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activities in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But some people have the idea that if you keep referring to the concept of Australia you are more or less <span class="highlight">subversive</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The duties include covering such matters as communism, <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activity, espionage and sabotage, vetting reports on persons who are liable to be security risks, dossiers kept and maintained on communists and suspects, advice and assistance to the local defence planning committee and a number of matters about aliens and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are some matters relating to <span class="highlight">subversive</span> elements, surveillance of public bodies for communist influence and also of industrial organisations, assisting the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in obtaining information where its powers are limited and where a police officer could obtain the required information in the normal execution of his duties, assisting other Government departments to organise a security system of documents etc., and reporting on all matters where political and industrial troubles are likely to arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is now the Commonwealth Police -  and the security functions in connection with <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activities affecting the internal security of Australia are under the control of  Mr Justice  Reed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If a public servant is suspected by the Security Service of <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activities it is proper that a record should be about him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need a security service because the task of a security service is to protect the nation as a whole, to secure the defence of the nation from external and internal dangers arising from attempts at espionage and sabotage and from actions of persons and organisations whether from outside or inside the country which are judged to be <span class="highlight">subversive</span> to the whole society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a <span class="highlight">subversive</span> organisation set out to plan a blueprint to bring into Australia deliberately and subversively roaring inflation it would use a program of 6 points, and I shall now enunciate them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, such a <span class="highlight">subversive</span> organisation would by its action take thousands of people out of the productive and manufacturing sector of the community where goods are made and transfer them into the public service which is a non productive area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this <span class="highlight">subversive</span> organisation was bent upon creating fewer goods and more demand it would cut down migration and thereby reduce the workforce which produces goods but at the same time increase the demand for those goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">subversive</span> organisation would foment industrial unrest so that there would be strikes, go-slows and trouble in industry, so that industry would be brought to a stop and inflation would be created by a shortage of goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, as a sixth test, in a form of lunacy unless it were deliberately <span class="highlight">subversive</span>, an organisation would raise interest rates generally because a substantial rise in interest rates will cause a substantial and significant rise the price of every commodity in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here we see under Labor, because of some of its current proposals- and I now refer to an earlier comment I made- some <span class="highlight">subversive</span> matters going on so far as this Government is concerned in relation to industrial matters; that is, the very fact of posing to the people referendums for prices and incomes control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point 1 want to make is this: Having addressed these law abiding citizens who loathe, hate and detest communism because they have experienced it, and having seen for myself that the meeting was conducted in a lawful and orderly manner, we found that on the Monday the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, from the AttorneyGeneral’s Department, descended upon the  Chairman  to ask questions about this <span class="highlight">subversive</span> gathering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister recollect that only a few years ago members of the present Government parties accused the Australian Labor Party of <span class="highlight">subversive</span> intent when it advocated the establishment of diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China and that indeed those parties when in government - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a question I asked on 7 April 1 978 relating to the visit of  Mr Valadimir  Kuzin who has a well documented history as a KGB agent and of <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activities on behalf of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in liberal democratic countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is <span class="highlight">subversive</span> of good government in that it is a direct attack on revenue and on the sense of fairness within the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not to be used so as to pry into any man ‘s private conduct or business affairs: or even into his political opinions, except in so far as they are <span class="highlight">subversive</span>, that is, they would contemplate the overthrow of the Government by unlawful means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its task is the Defence of the Realm as a whole, from external and internal dangers arising from attempts at espionage and sabotage or from actions of persons and organisations whether directed from within or without the country, which may be judged to be <span class="highlight">subversive</span> of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that these people may dissent from prevailing government views does not necessarily make them <span class="highlight">subversive</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are all the more so, since, in the past, ASIO officers have shown a tendency to think of anyone they choose to call ‘left wing’ as <span class="highlight">subversive</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These include persons such as members of organisations or groups regarded as <span class="highlight">subversive</span> or potentially <span class="highlight">subversive</span>, and persons who have contacts with the members of unfriendly intelligence services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that we should become patronising, but there are many Anglo-Saxons who, when they are faced with a volatile person with a different background, seem to write that person off as being <span class="highlight">subversive</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the last few years there has been an increasing build-up of <span class="highlight">subversive</span> action and terrorism throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But one only has to look at the situation in terms of terrorism, <span class="highlight">subversive</span> action or drugs to see the truth of that statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion is made that it is quite likely we will see more terrorism and <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activities in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just because someone says something against the government of the day, it should not be taken by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to be a <span class="highlight">subversive</span> utterance against the security of the state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not <span class="highlight">subversive</span> to be opposed to national service, or to the war in Vietnam; it is not <span class="highlight">subversive</span> to demonstrate against either, or indeed to demonstrate against an act of the government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it is not <span class="highlight">subversive</span> to demonstrate against either, or indeed to demonstrate against an act of the government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many present activities will be considered unlawful and <span class="highlight">subversive</span> under the new Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I took her out not because in some way I liked her but because I had some sort of <span class="highlight">subversive</span> attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never been, and never will be, engaged in any <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall reading that Thyssen, the big German industrialist, described how he had contributed towards the development of the <span class="highlight">subversive</span> organisation from within. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not be protected if ASIO, under its charter, past, present or future, uses the same sort of personnel and adopts the same sort of attitudes as it has for the last 30 years- people of prejudice, people of the belief that everybody who engages in legitimate political activity in some way can be involved in unlawful acts and <span class="highlight">subversive</span> action, and is thus a threat to the democracy in which we live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there may be all sorts of activities which coincidentally or otherwise might promote hostility between persons or groups of persons which are not unlawful activities or activities which could, in the wider stretch of the imagination, in our view, be described as <span class="highlight">subversive</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are amendments which are put forward in a constructive spirit in relation to what is a very difficult subject matter and that is the definition of subversion or the description of acts which can be regarded as <span class="highlight">subversive</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point that I am making is this: If the word ultimately’ stays in the Bill then we have caught up as potentially <span class="highlight">subversive</span>- therefore subject to all the powers that are vested in the Organisation by this Act- all those rather pathetic little splinter groups particularly of the far Left which engage in most cases more out of a sense of duty rather than any real belief in fuzzy, millenarian rhetoric about the ultimate revolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, a <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activity will be one which from time to time may lead at some distant point in time- it need not be a particularly distant point in time- to the use of force, which is otherwise regarded as the criterion for the designation of a <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activity under clause 5. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He goes on to talk about matters in which there is ‘probable cause’ to believe that these sorts of things will occur, and writes specifically of the question of the immediacy of the threat or perceived threat that exists because of particular <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the members of this chamber are being asked to give their assent to is an amendment that takes out of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill the word ‘ultimately’ which leaves it to somebody to determine whether the activities in which a person is engaged are <span class="highlight">subversive</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that anybody or any organisation which believes in and has a commitment to the use of force or violence at some future stage, even though it may not be engaged in such activities at the moment or may not even intend to engage in them in the near future, for the purposes of overthrowing the constitutional government of this country should be regarded as <span class="highlight">subversive</span> and should be kept under surveillance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators look at the provision of clause 5( 1 )(a) they will see that it is clear that the element of intention in the person who is seeking to be <span class="highlight">subversive</span> within the meaning of the clause is covered; if he engages in activities which involve, will involve or are intended to involve the overthrow of the State by violence and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that conduct to which the word ‘ultimately’ relates, not the conduct of the person who is being judged as to whether he falls within the provisions of the clause and is thus to be regarded as <span class="highlight">subversive</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, because it is likely to lead to the violent or unlawful overthrowing of a government, it is said that it ought to be regarded as <span class="highlight">subversive</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These powers, we concede, albeit reluctantly, ought to be available where what is happening now is <span class="highlight">subversive</span> in the language of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are most cautious about accepting the propriety of is the notion that activity which is simply aimed at communicating to the public at large what are perceived to be deficiencies and undemocratic qualities in the organisation in question, that that kind of proselytising activity- which in our view would come squarely within the terms of paragraph (b)- would be counted <span class="highlight">subversive</span> and brings into operation all of the apparatus that this Bill is about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We suggest that that kind of activity, which is aimed at exposing, for better or for worse, the activities of security organisations, should be treated as <span class="highlight">subversive</span> only when it is itself, by virtue of some explicit statute or common law rule that might be applicable to it, unlawful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise again that we are here dealing with definitions of domestic subversion, or activities on the domestic scene that may be regarded as of a <span class="highlight">subversive</span> character, for the purpose of defining the powers of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier in this debate, just whether or not it would be justifiable to consider a particular form of activity to be <span class="highlight">subversive</span> would be a matter for the professional judgment of the Director-General of security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But insofar as interfering with the purposes of security or the defence of the Commonwealth is concerned, any activities, be they legal or illegal- and many of them may be highly objectionable and may be intended to develop, perhaps later, into illegal activities- may well be activities which ought to be under surveillance and ought to be considered as <span class="highlight">subversive</span> by this organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once in the mind of the Director-General some person is capable of undertaking <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activities then he falls into a category of having certain things done to him or her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The industrial action that I talked about which has been taken by the Transport Workers Union in New South Wales in the past has not been classified as <span class="highlight">subversive</span> and it wants to know whether it will be classified as <span class="highlight">subversive</span> under this clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we take the proper literary and grammatical interpretation of this clause we must come to the conclusion, as  Senator Sibraa  indicated, that unions, for example, can be accused of engaging in <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It opens up the definition of subversion in such a way that it can be directed against groups and individuals in the community who, in our view anyway, should not be characterised as <span class="highlight">subversive</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The person who will be applying these definitions is primarily none other than the Attorney-General himself in the exercise of his powers, in conjunction with the Director-General, under this legislation- in particular, his powers to issue warrants for electronic surveillance, search and seizure and so on of people who can be characterised as <span class="highlight">subversive</span> according to these definitions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I would not wish- and I would be very grateful to get the views of the AttorneyGeneral on this-that kind of contribution to public dialogue, however unattractive it may be to be treated as <span class="highlight">subversive</span> and such as to bring into operation all the procedures provided for in this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, I ask the Attorney-General whether it would not be a reasonable, not a stretched or strained application of this language in subclause (c) as it reads at the moment, to have it applicable to the industrial arena so as to expose the industrial disputants in question- of whom there is always a litter on the scene at any given time- to characterisation as <span class="highlight">subversive</span> and thus being within the operation of this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is sad and regrettable that it appears that these powers are necessary in order to bring about the sort of control of <span class="highlight">subversive</span> and illegal activities at which this Bill is aimed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We put to the Government proposals to tighten up the definition of what constitutes <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greater the accountability, the tighter the definition of <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activity, the more readily the Opposition might have accepted the exercise of powers as contained in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because of the Government’s rejection of our accountability proposals, because of the Government’s rejection of our suggestion for the tightening of the definition of <span class="highlight">subversive</span> activity, the Opposition feels obliged to say to the Attorney-General that when warrants are issued to carry out a search of premises of Australian citizens who are not guilty of offences, to open their mail and to intercept telephonic communications, the Attorney ought to satisfy himself that every alternative legal and practicable step has been taken to obtain the information which is sought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that I am out of order by referring to clause 5 which deals with the ridiculous definition of subversion- somebody blowing his nose might be <span class="highlight">subversive</span> if he did it in a certain circumstance- and clause 8, with its unbearable and unreasonable load of responsibility on the Director-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This could, of course, apply to information passed to a police force of a State concerning a person who may be engaged, or is likely to be engaged, in <span class="highlight">subversive</span> or terrorist activity, sabotage, espionage or anything else which comes within the powers of the Organization. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that just as there are views in the community that change with the nature of society and that there are individuals in the community who are more or less receptive to changing attitudes, so there are judges, eminent men and women as they may be, who, at the age of 65 years and over, are likely to be less sensitive to what the community regards, in a number of matters, as politically <span class="highlight">subversive</span> or political undesirable and are therefore likely to attract an adverse security assessment- a view that might not be shared by a person appointed to the bench at a considerably younger age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be revealed that the Minister has refused to act on evidence brought forward by ASIO that some <span class="highlight">subversive</span> group has infiltrated one of the major political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What can the Government do under the range of powers available to it, perhaps under the postal or interstate trade and commerce powers, to prevent the dissemination by advertising or interview of these sorts of remarks or schemes so <span class="highlight">subversive</span> of the national revenue and the community’s sense of fairness? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They provide the means by which the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and its officers, the DirectorGeneral particularly, will be able to put into effect their interpretations and the Government’s interpretations about what is considered to be a <span class="highlight">subversive</span> matter or a matter that requires some surveillance, some investigation or some collection of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view- I say this seriously- those <span class="highlight">subversive</span> characters should be placed in exactly that limbo, beyond the realm where ordinary, honest citizens participate in the democratic process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I repeat, in regard to those people, those <span class="highlight">subversive</span> elements, those tax avoiders, our attitude shoud be: No representation without taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He sought to engage in <span class="highlight">subversive</span> action by attending a peace conference in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it thinks a person has <span class="highlight">subversive</span> thoughts, that person can be gaoled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people are denying the sinews and victuals to government, and in that respect they are <span class="highlight">subversive</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a deeper sense in which they are <span class="highlight">subversive</span>, and that is in the creation of a feeling of inequity amongst potential taxpayers within the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I say that they are proffered around the community, in my view there is no doubt that we have a type of <span class="highlight">subversive</span> literature which is an advertising of these schemes and which to my mind ought to be condemned as strongly as the schemes themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that until they are prepared to make their fair contribution to our society, until they are prepared to create a situation in which there is a feeling of equity and in which everyone has a fair go, these <span class="highlight">subversive</span> elements, these tax avoiders, should have this attitude of the community firmly stated to them: ‘No representation for them without their taxation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I am not sure whether my question should be directed to  Senator Carrick,  who deals with passport control, or the Attorney-General, who deals with <span class="highlight">subversive</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
