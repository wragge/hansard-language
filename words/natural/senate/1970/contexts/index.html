<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How can the Government justify higher prices for the use of our own <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Wright said the core of development plans for Alice Springs would be preservation of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the numerous suggestions emanating from Government senators on how the trade unions should operate in accordance with the principles of elementary justice and the national interest, how does he reconcile those objectives with the type of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice that exists iu the commercial world, as exemplified by last Friday’s meeting of Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers Ltd at which the majority of Australian resident shareholders who sought to slop this industrial giant ravishing the Colong Caves region of New South Wales were crushed by a large group of overseas shareholders who regard Australia as only a mineral harlot? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the circumstances I think it was <span class="highlight">natural</span> that it should happen and I have an idea that  Senator Devitt  to some extent inadvertently made the same technical breach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700820_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the grave concern expressed by the Cook Nature Reserve Committee at the rapid deterioration of the Mount Painter Hill Reserve due to uncontrolled civic vandalism, when can a favourable decision be expected proclaiming this area a <span class="highlight">natural</span> reserve with an extensive programme of regeneration of the slopes with native trees? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that no contract has been signed for the construction of a <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas pipeline from Sale, Victoria to Sydney, New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has any contract been signed for the construction of a <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas pipeline from Sale, Victoria, to Sydney, New South Wales; if so, what is the proposed route of the pipeline and who makes the final decision as to the route to be followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What has been the volume and value of (a) oil, and (b) <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas, produced in (i) Australia, and (ii) Queensland in each year since 1963? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps they do inhibit some of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> beauty of this lovely city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If charges are to be laid they will be laid under the Continental Shelf (Living <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Resources) Act 1968 which came into force on 15th April 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that such clearing of land leads not only to the discoloration of water in reservoirs but also to erosion and siltation of the reservoirs and off-take weirs and the loss of water from the soil by evaporation and hence the early drying of <span class="highlight">natural</span> springs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an indisputable fact that no <span class="highlight">natural</span> resource can withstand hunting on such a concentrated scale, unless some provision is made for its future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of preface I refer to the open appeal, emanating from 800 Australian scientists this morning, for a greater appreciation of the need for conservation of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710520_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a <span class="highlight">natural</span> corollary to this question I ask the Minister whether early talks could be arranged between himself and federal officers of the meat workers union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the waste of <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and the undoubted polluting effect of nonreturnable soft drink bottles and beer bottles, will the Minister consider legislating for a Commonwealth ban on such one way bottles? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Civil Aviation aware of the strong and growing volume of protest against the proposal that an airfield should be constructed in the Duffy’s Forest area in the heart of one of the few remaining <span class="highlight">natural</span> flora and fauna reserves near Sydney? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This amendment has the qualification of the addition of the expression ‘for the term of bis <span class="highlight">natural</span> life’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The spokesman would not comment on the charge this would mean destroying the <span class="highlight">natural</span> environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“9a.- The State shall ensure that <span class="highlight">natural</span> forests shall not be cleared for planting softwoods unless the particular proposed clearing has beforehand been  the  subject of an environmental impact study made by an independent expert on behalf of the Australian Forestry Council and that .the Council after considering the report of the said study has approved the particular clearing’ “. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That there be referred to the Standing Committee on Industry and Trade the following matter - The report that the Australian Gas Light Company is proposing to conclude a contract with a Japanese corporation for the manufacture and supply of steel pipes for the proposed <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas pipeline from Moomba <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas field in South Australia to Sydney and whether this would deny Australian steel producers and suppliers the opportunity to fabricate and supply the required steel or any part ofit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If so, will it, as a matter of urgency and in the interests of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice, establish a public inquiry to ascertain all information relevant to the execution of the 3 former Croats and their notified punishment by the Communists in Yugoslavia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am sorry if 1 missed, it, but I did not hear any explanation of the inquiry  Senator Greenwood  made as to why the distinction between an adopted child and a <span class="highlight">natural</span>, legitimate child is preserved? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot see why, for the purpose of consenting to a marriage, a parent who has become a parent by adoption is in any position different from the parent of a legal and <span class="highlight">natural</span> child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Mr Neruda  was not only one of the greatest poets of the century and the holder of the Nobel Prize for literature but also a diplomat in the service of the Chilean Government and a supporter of the previous democratically elected Government of that country, will the Minister ask the Department of Foreign Affairs to make inquiries as to whether the allegation by the Chilean junta that he died of <span class="highlight">natural</span> causes is in fact correct? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My attention was drawn to this problem, and I am advised that the Minister for Minerals and Energy has assured the Premier of South Australia that, irrespective of any shortfall in the possible supply of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas from Gidgealpa, the Australian Government will provide the necessary backup by the planned extension of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas pipeline from Gid.geapla to Palm Valley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Minerals and Energy aware of the concern expressed by the Electricity Trust of South Australia about the future supply of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas from Gidgealpa for use at the Torrens Island power station in that State? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government propose to ignore statements by conservation authorities that the Galston area must be preserved in its <span class="highlight">natural</span> state; if not, does this make a hollow mockery of the Government ‘s claim to support conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister inform the Senate whether Miss Nola Garanamba ‘s <span class="highlight">natural</span> father did, in fact, see his daughter in Darwin; if so, did a Government Department pay his expenses from Maningrida to Darwin for the purpose of collecting his daughter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I may say, however, that it is a well-established rule of law that the principles of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice require that a person adjudicating on a dispute between parties should not himself have an interest in the subject matter of the dispute, or to have otherwise been personally involved in the matter under dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-3">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter of soil conservation is of tremendous importance to Australia, which is still primarily an agricultural and pastoral country, and the purposes of the Bill are to see that we preserve this great <span class="highlight">natural</span> asset of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The argument put forward by honourable senators opposite is that we should send our rams overseas so that the quality of merino sheep in other parts of the world can be improved and in  10  or  15  years  wool  from those countries will come on to the market and supply a demand for medium to fine wools - the equivalent of merino wool - and that, in turn, will keep the demand for the <span class="highlight">natural</span> fibre, the merino wool, going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Few lawyers have a <span class="highlight">natural</span> preference for parliamentary drafting and it will not ordinarily attract a sufficient number of suitable practitioners from other fields of legal work unless a career in drafting is given such a status as will counterbalance what is thought to be its lack of appeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If anything goes wrong with those sea routes - we know it has gone wrong and we have seen the evidence of what happens when it has gone wrong - to deter the proper development of Tasmania then we of course suffer, our economy suffers, and we will continue to bc a mendicant State for years into the future unless the <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and the <span class="highlight">natural</span> attractions of this State of ours can be used and exploited to the maximum possible extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this connection let me suggest that rather than it be a service in which one has to wait for somebody else to die or to retire through effluxion of time, or to leave by some act of his own, in order to move up the scale there should be a provision in the terms of service in the Office of Parliamentary Counsel that the salary range lifts as a <span class="highlight">natural</span> consequence of period of service in this branch of the service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The approach to this economic or commercial exploitation of the kangaroo for meat parallels our approach to the exploitation of every other <span class="highlight">natural</span> resource, whether it be prawns in the Gulf, crayfish in the north or fish on the continental shelf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have not been unduly apprehensive about the injection of foreign capital into the exploitation of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of this country because I recognise that the risk capital available in Australia for the purposes of exploiting our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources is not adequate to enable us to do what overseas investment can achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is still room for foreign investment, but I am one who believes that a foreign company has to recognise that if it comes here to take advantage of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources, in addition to paying a small royalty to a State government for the coal or uranium or bauxite or whatever it is that is being won, it should, in its own interests as well as in the interests of Australia, give some consideration to taking an Australian element into the company and at least giving Australian investors an opportunity to invest in these undertakings to a greater extent than is the case at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this country had taken a reasonable path in the early days after the last World War and had been prepared to have a measure of control of wages and prices we would have been far ahead of any other country wilh our rich <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and we would have been able to make the best use of the gifts this country has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report brings into very sharp relief the problem that the wool industry has in presenting Australian <span class="highlight">natural</span> fibres and competing with the great and growing demand and supply of synthetic fibres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He gave notice of a motion that a select committee of the Senate be appointed to inquire into the desirability and practicability of establishing a national organisation to deal with the effects of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters, and in particular those arising from fire, flood and drought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are discussing the desirability and practicability of establishing a national organisation to deal with the effects of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters, and particularly those arising from fire, flood and drought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We live in a country where <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters, especially fires, floods and droughts, are recurring phenomena. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am referring to statutory and voluntary bodies, the efforts of which could be co-ordinated by a national organisation to enable optimum assistance to be given to people suffering from the effects of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why should we not investigate whether Australia should have the permanent machinery which we lack at present, to be put into operation automatically when a <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster occurs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposal for the establishment of a national organisation to deal with the effects of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters has been about for a long time and it ought to be thoroughly investigated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think that the establishment of a national organisation to deal with the effects of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters is an extremely important matter that ought not to be delayed further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the greatest permanent problems facing Australia and one with which the Committee should engage itself without delay, lt is true that a number of proposals are set out in my notices of motion, but the question of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters is the only proposal which I seek to have referred to the Standing Committee on Primary and Secondary Industry and Trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although other questions may be important, I would suggest, with respect, that in view of our experience over the years of the effects of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters and in view of the existence of flood and droughts at the present lime and the moral certainty that there will be further such <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters in the future, the Senate ought to endorse this reference to the Standing Committee on Primary and Secondary Industry and Trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What Australia needs is a permanent secretariat, consisting of State and Federal officials, ready to anticipate and study <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters, evolve contingency plans, and act as the co-ordinating body when asked to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister is no doubt aware of the growing public consciousness of the need for plans for mitigation of the effects of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters, such as floods, fires and cyclones, and the need to gather information for scientific research into the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700827_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quite naturally, in a city that is growing at the rate at which Canberra is there must be quite dramatic increases in valuations of properties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, the growth of any community that grows as dramatically as Canberra has grown in recent times will naturally bring in its train a substantial increase in the value of property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>lt is quite <span class="highlight">natural</span> that there should be the reaction that these dramatic increases - I do not want to refer to them; they are or will be in the record - highlight and tend to throw into relief something which may appear at first sight to be a bad policy or a bad practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore it is only <span class="highlight">natural</span> that our predispositions, as we come to a particular State, would be by virtue of previous sentimental attachments or by the acquisition of personal and professional experience to favour an emphasis on a system that to some extent reflects our own, as against a system that would represent a departure or a major departure from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But coal is a wasting asset and looking into the future it leads us in South Australia to feel that there is a very strong case - bearing in mind that we have no power source other than <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and the coal deposits to which 1 have referred - for South Australia to be given due consideration for the provision of a nuclear reactor to feed power into the State grids. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet it needs to be placed very firmly on the record that, in spite of these handicaps, South Australia has over a period of years brought itself to a situation where it has developed a manufacturing ability and capacity far in excess of what its population percentage and its <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources might lead one to expect from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Merely as illustrations, we refer here to bodies such as the Aus tralian Conservation Foundation, the Colong Committee, the Great Barrier Reef Committee, the National Parks Association of New South Wales, and to the very many individuals who are greatly concerned about aspects of the environment such as the protection of the coastline, the preservation of wildlife, and the maintenance ir their <span class="highlight">natural</span> state of water bodies such as the Myall Lakes in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#debate-89">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The inclusion of the term ‘social environment’ in the very title of the Committee to which we are referring paints a broad picture and goes far beyond the areas of air and water, ft is <span class="highlight">natural</span> that  Senator Murphy  and all of us who may speak in this debate or who may have any connection with the Committee will have a deep and continuing interest in these 2 areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>State Governments are primarily responsible for financing relief and restoration following <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters such as floods and fires and, except in the case of the relief of personal hardship and distress, the Commonwealth normally assists only where it is considered that the amount of abnormal expenditure involved would impose an undue burden on the State’s resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At that time, on behalf of the Opposition, I moved an amendment in these terms to the motion to take note of the Budget papers: and the Senate is of the opinion that the Budget is inadequate in that - (a) it increases taxation and health and housing costs for families; (b) it makes no considered and comprehensive approach to the needs of all schools; (c) it ignores the problems of capital cities and regional centres; (d) it defers further development projects and urgent rural measures; and (e) it neglects industries based on Australian <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and defence requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But now the price is so good that the refinery companies - Mobil Oil Australia Ltd is the big offender - are able to buy Australian crude oil at $2.05 per barrel, ship it half way around the world and make a profit, f have proposed this question before: ls Australia so affluent in its <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources that it can afford to export oil? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would respectfully say to  Senator Cotton  that, regardless of what he may have to do in regard to the major decision he has to make on the subject of the numerous deputations that have been made to him, he should ensure that the people who reside near this area of <span class="highlight">natural</span> bushland are not subject to unnecessary disturbances from all types of aircraft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact your Committee agrees that if supplies have been satisfactorily provided and there is an abnormal delay in the receipt of a claim for payment, it would not be a distortion of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> course of events for a supplier to be informed that his claim had not been received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the light of recent answers that I have received from him about certain directives to hospital and medical benefits fund managements, is not a <span class="highlight">natural</span> corollary to such action the creation of a health insurance commission, which was mooted by one of his predecessors, to ensure that the funds maintain the course that his colleague and former Minister for Health,  Senator Greenwood,  decreed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is only <span class="highlight">natural</span>, in view of what has been happening in the Liberal Party, that accusations would be made to the effect that the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  was seeking a wider power base within his Party by appointing Assistant Ministers at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a young and rich land with an abundance of <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-55-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Due notice having been given, the matter is properly within the forms of the Senate, and if it is proper to be reconsidered <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice may demand that it be reconsidered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To fail, in those circumstances, so to act is a denial of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, in this matter there was a denial of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There having been a denial of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice in the operations of a tribunal acting judicially, the proceedings, insofar as there has been a denial, should be quashed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The denial of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice was this: When the report was presented to the Senate it was adopted in toto on 13 th May by resolution of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A decision to deport an alien (in respect of which the courts have declined to require observance of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice) probably falls into this category, even though the Home Secretary’s decision may be based on considerations of national security or the maintenance of friendly relations with foreign States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a conflict between two parties, two people -  - a view that may have been based on an oversimplified interpretation of the cases on <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice decided under the Housing and New Towns Acts - overlooked two relevant lines of cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, there arc the cases in which a duty to act judicially in accordance with the rules of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice has been held to arise by implication from the nature of a power and its impact upon the rights of individuals, despite the absence of any express duty to follow a procedure analogous to the judicial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, if the violation of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice lay in the fact that they had not been given an opportunity after the verdict had been brought in to be heard on the question of punishment or why punishment should not be inflicted upon them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a person, having been found guilty of an offence, is then denied the opportunity to be heard, does that constitute such a denial of justice as to amount to a violation of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice which requires either a quashing of the conviction or, for that matter, a retrial of the offence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Authorities are clear and unmistakable that if that right is denied, a violation of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice has’ occurred which must be rectified through the legal tribunals of the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a condign and appropriate step to take, That step, if denied, is considered a violation of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Court, in the case of Coward and Stapleton, did not use the term ‘<span class="highlight">natural</span> justice’, but it quashed the conviction of the person concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>failure to give counsel for the defend an opportunity to be heard on sentence was, without more, a denial of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We consider that thereby there was at that stage a denial of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice to the defendant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that there is no section of the Justices Act which specifically gives to a defendant the opportunity to be heard upon sentence, but we are led to the firm conclusion that such an opportunity should be given and that if it is not so given then there is a denial of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Byrne, as a lawyer, should know that the common law doctrine of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice must cede to express provisions in a statute, even if the Parliament were to be regarded as a court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not bound strictly by any laws of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is as I have said, that the Senate is not bound by any laws of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope though - and I believe - that it has acted according to the laws of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice and I would hope that when the Privileges Committee gets down to an examination of its procedures it would spell out all sorts of protection for witnesses who are called before committees and for people in the position of the journalists who were called here on that day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were not, to use strict language, bound by the rules of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice but they were under an obligation to act fairly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us go back and in the name of conscience have another complete discussion on whether at all stages we have given these people <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were worried about the question of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not enter this debate as a lawyer because I am not one, but as one who has some respect for <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice, particularly as it applies to the rights of honourable senators to bring before the Senate matters that they consider to be in the interests of the Senate and the citizens of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the fact that we have these rights, does not give us the power to ignore the ordinary concepts of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice and the forms of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice which have been found by the courts of England and Australia over the ages to be necessary to carry out <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Natural</span> justice demands at least that before a sentence is passed a person found guilty should be given the right to speak at the eleventh hour in his own defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Is it not <span class="highlight">natural</span> that a brilliant trained lawyer, as  Senator Byrne  is, should have his doubts that, having set the precedent which we set on this occasion, we might adopt the same practice on an occasion when the offence is a far more serious one and when the sentence may be vastly different to the one which  Senator Byrne  referred to as ‘being flogged with a feather’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not fail to take every precautionary measure to protect the <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice that should be afforded to citizens who may at any time offend and who may have to appear before us, as a judicial tribunal, when we may be called upon rightly to impose sentences upon those people to protect the rights of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, therefore, gives us much higher responsibility to ensure that our forms shall not be lesser than those of the courts but instead will be even more powerful in protecting the <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice and the rights of somebody who even wishes to plead, when guilty, for the mercy of those who are about to sentence him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Senate affirms that decision, as I hope it will, I believe that that will be a satisfaction to everybody who took part in the proceedings in May, because 1 for my part would not relish the situation if it were thought by any considerable number of honourable senators that we had lacked a sense of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice and had not been scrupulous to observe every precaution which would ensure a proper and just adjudgment of the situation so far as the editors were concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances, we were under an obligation to have regard for judicial procedures, and it is in our departure from the observance of those procedures that, in my submission, a violation of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice has occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be no discredit to the Senate if on a calm consideration of the proposition it should find that there has been a violation of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may

    <p>Of course, the period is being considered in relation to the <span class="highlight">natural</span> obsolescence of plant that will be superseded when the imperial system is replaced by the metric system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is the developing method of joint practices; there is the <span class="highlight">natural</span> instinct for medicos to go overseas in search of higher degrees and to become Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not need to remind honourable senators that with the <span class="highlight">natural</span> increase in the working population and with the intake of migrants which, though reduced, will continue, the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was <span class="highlight">natural</span> that as the head of a recently formed government 1 should welcome the opportunity for discussions with the leaders of 2 major powers who are traditionally close friends and allies of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Realisation of these plans will, the Committee believes, provide adequate safeguards for the future, however, the Committee is concerned at the present degree of reliance on the <span class="highlight">natural</span> self-purification capacity of the Molonglo River. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For my part I think that it is <span class="highlight">natural</span> that if parliamentary drafting work has little appeal to persons who come out from the universities there has to be some incentive to attract to the parliamentary drafting service persons who have the competence and the will to persist in the performance of drafting work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have relaxed certain aspects of the naturalisation procedures so that migrants will more readily accept Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The method of naturalisation of migrants has been relaxed to the extent that they no longer have to go as far in swearing an oath as they previously did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The entitlement to the age pension has been relaxed technically, but not to the extent that a <span class="highlight">natural</span> born Australian or an immigrant who has accepted citizenship can obtain the benefits of the age pension if he has not had 10 years continuous residence in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will note that specific purpose capital payments to the States, excluding <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster relief payments, are estimated to increase by 12.7 per cent in 1971-72, compared with an increase of 7.8 per cent in 1970-71. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is very apparent that what is required in Australia today is a scientific development of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and we have a race of people who seem peculiarly adapted to this type of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that Australia is a world leader in the production of such <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources as fissionable materials; fuel and energy resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has started to invest money, but we believe that as well as the AIDC there should be a lead from the Government as to what should be done with our tremendous <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Japan is tremendously dependent on our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources, and it is becoming more and more dependent on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a fuel and energy policy and in looking at the development of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources we must look not only at the assets that we can sell arid at the secondary and tertiary developments but also at the ecology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and we have the type of people who are very good in this work- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the honourable senator was talking about was the need for a national fuel policy, a consideration of overseas ownership of assets in Australia, a very wide-ranging argument dealing with an examination of <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources, national fuel and capital investments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer particularly to the resources of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Japan is very anxious to purchase <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas from Australia or from anywhere else in the world where it can be obtained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its main purpose in buying <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas is to be able to reduce the pollution of its cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would achieve this by using <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas as a fuel in heavy industry and in other ways throughout its cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas, used in a liquefied form in motor vehicles in city traffic, will be the fuel of the future for the reduction of pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Bass Strait area we have control by ownership of 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not one ounce of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas or one teaspoonful of crude oil has been found within the 3-mile limit off shore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is one other very large deposit of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>regulate the exploration, development, transportation, marketing and use of oil, <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas, coal, fissionable materials and generative water, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the airport is established there will be extensive damage tothe ecology of <span class="highlight">natural</span> bushland over a widespead area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its approach to this subject, the Committee has not attempted the undertaking of any full-scale inquiry into the liquefied petroleum gas industry in Australia, nor has it examined the possible effects upon the Australian market as <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas from fields other than Bass Strait come into production, and as piped <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas becomes available to the Sydney Metropolitan area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report shows that LPG derived from Bass Strait <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas, and which is exported overseas, is not always of the proper specification for general use in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is strange that with our great reserves of coal, iron ore, <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and so on - you name it; we have it - never al any time has anyone suggested that the auction system should be used to dispose of these commodities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fairly <span class="highlight">natural</span> that unless something very spectacular takes place in a rather limited area then the financial viability of that area - in this instance Tasmania - is very much related to the limits of its ability to generate its own revenue and carry out its own functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is <span class="highlight">natural</span> and, J think, encouraging, that they should look to Australia in this, and the Australian Labor Party offers no opposition to Judge Nimmo taking up this appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However in accordance with the penalty provisions of the Continental Shelf (Living <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Resources) Act the court ordered the forfeiture of all sedentary organisms found on the ship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other Act, to which I draw the honourable senator’s attention, is the Continental Shelf (Living <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Resources) Act 1968 under which the Commonwealth controls the exploitation of sedentary species over the entire continental shelf off Australia beyond the 3 miles limit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-92-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Government allowed a take-over by foreign interests of a great part of Australia’s <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Now the British people find that the very people whom they have fought for so long are their <span class="highlight">natural</span> allies and trading partners and that the old ideals and ideas of empire have faded away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we have the spectacle of the Japanese coming in and taking over our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The desirability of establishing a national organisation to prepare for and deal with the effects of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters such as fires, floods, droughts, cyclones and earth movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The desirability of establishing a national  organi.sation  to prepare for and deal with the effects of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters such as fires, floods, droughts, cyclones and earth movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Australia is a land which is subject to recurring <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore we must regard ourselves as occupying a country in which <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters of considerable magnitude are not to be regarded as a surprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The failure to provide properly for it was mentioned by the then Secretary-General of the United Nations on 13th May 1971 when he issued a report entitled ‘Assistance in Cases of <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Disaster’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to provide an orderly and continuing means of assistance by the Federal government, the States and  local  governments in carrying  .out  their responsibilities to alleviate suffering and damage resulting from <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters, repair essential public facilities in major disasters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the point of view of Federal planning in Australia for <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters, it can be seen that each State has its own system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Great <span class="highlight">natural</span> calamities might strike at Queensland in the form of a cyclone, or Tasmania as happened in the case of the great bush fire, or somewhere else in the form of an earthquake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without dealing with any particular situation in the past regarding requests for Commonwealth assistance, it appears that where at the Federal level there is no definite system of planning and co-ordination against national disasters, there will always be confusion when a major <span class="highlight">natural</span> catastrophe occurs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not think anyone here differs on the need to prepare for the eventuality of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters which must come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us set up this organisation so that we can do the best possible for those who are affected and for our nation in the event of other <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters which we must expect to occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition admits that he is using the vehicle of a parliamentary procedure to express a view in relation to how <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters should be dealt with in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the basic fallacies in our attitude to the whole question of the relief of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters is that we refuse persistently and consistently to accept this as a fact of life in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The erosion of a beach which is the great commercial asset of a tourist area is as much a <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster to that area - to the traders who operate in the area, the land holders and the entrepreneurs who expend and commit their money there - as a major drought or a major bushfire is to another area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another aspect that has to be rethought is this: We think of the relief of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters only in terms of rectification or the compensation that follows the occurrence of a disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What Australia needs is a permanent secretariat, consisting of State and Federal officials, ready to anticipate and study <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters, evolve contingency plans and act as the co-ordinating body when asked to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It investigated a somewhat similar proposition - the <span class="highlight">natural</span> destruction by substantially human agencies of our water courses, our waterways and our littoral water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>f am sure that a co-ordinating body such as we contemplate would recommend methods by which people would be encouraged to mitigate against the possible consequences of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are debating the desirability of establishing a national organisation to prepare for and deal with the effects  of  <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters such as fires, floods, droughts, cyclones and earth movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the motion that has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate  (Senator Murphy)  in order to enable the Senate to discuss the desirability of establishing a national organisation to prepare for and deal with the effects of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters such as fires, floods, droughts, cyclones and earth movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy  has mentioned, and we all know, that several other countries have plans or have implemented plans to deal with <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But generally speaking, the way in which we tackle these problems of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster on a national scale is on a voluntary basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the only problem the setting up of a <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster fund? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we worrying only about the financial side Or are we worrying also about the physical effects of a <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an obligation on all of us as individuals or as members of voluntary organisations, within the terms of our normal employment, to do something to alleviate the effects of a <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who are the people immediately involved, regardless of the kind of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster that occurs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally the work of these people is overlaid by the work of other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Naturally, when one suffers a disaster one needs outside assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think any person in this ‘chamber can condemn or criticise the Commonwealth Government for its attitude to financial assistance in respect of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters over the last 22 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that an argument may well be put forward that members of the armed Services should be trained in some way to provide assistance in areas which suffer <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Surely the armed Services are the only group to cope wilh a <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How will these requirements be superimposed by some director of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters situated in Canberra, with regional directors all about the place, drawing no doubt upon the talents of officers in all sorts of odd departments to meet the needs of a situation of this sort? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have found out by actual experience that most of the problems that we have with floods, fires, droughts and all the other <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters are handled much better on a local basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No State of this Commonwealth has been free of the ravages of one or other of these <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters, and on each occasion very great misery, hardship, tremendous distress and damage to installations and property have followed in their wake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Wc are indebted to  Senator Murphy  for having instituted this discussion in which we are considering (he desirability of establishing a national organisation to prepare for and deal with the effects of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters such as tires, floods, droughts, cyclones and earth movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That implies immediately an organisation based in Canberra to deal with matters which arise from so-called <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Relief and restoration measures other than the relief of personal hardship and distress resulting from <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters was regarded as a State responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I do suggest to you is that restrictive trade practices provide for prices to be determined on an arbitrary basis, which is neither regulated  by  the <span class="highlight">natural</span> forces of supply and demand, nor necessarily in the interests of other than the persons who engage itf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 8 November 1967,  Senator Wright’s  motion was amended, on the motion of  Senator Murphy,  to include provision for the Committee to inquire into: whether the legislation makes adequate provision for Australian ownership and/or control or Australian participation in the ownership and/or control of Australia’s off-shore resources of oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We recommend that a national pipelines policy be implemented immediately, and that legislation be enacted - this may require the co-operation of the States - to regulate the construction and operation of pipelines for the carriage interstate or intra-state of oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are loadings going on to the cost of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas in Queensland because of the private construction of pipelines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In New South Wales, the mother State of the Commonwealth with the largest capital city, there is no <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas available yet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as the situation stands at the moment, because of the inability of New South Wales and Victoria to reach agreement on pricing <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policies adopted for the development of an Australia oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas industry have caused continuing increases in the price which the motoring public is required to pay for petrol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, the householder being provided with <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas is paying more for his fuel than would be payable if, as suggested to the Committee, a pricing formula for <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas - irrespective of where it is produced - similar to that used by the United States of America Federal Power Commission were adopted in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So, who decides what prices will be paid for oil, its by-products and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But in my view the Commonwealth and the States are not receiving sufficient revenue from this great discovery of a <span class="highlight">natural</span> resource which has potential for helping this country to do so many things which it should be able to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In lots of the other States the main railway lines and arterial roads are fairly close to the capital cities and the seaboard and in some States the length of railway lines and of roads is very small in comparison with the situation in Queensland and the number of people who contribute to the upkeep of those systems is 2 or 3 times as great, lt is only <span class="highlight">natural</span> that the cost of maintaining rail services in Queensland is great. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have heard sad stories from the Queensland Premier and his colleagues about all the money that the State has spent as a result of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters, firstly, the big drought, and secondly the damage caused by floods and cyclones late last year and early this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say to honourable senators, in low key, that if the man Shanley feels that he is aggrieved, whether or not he is able himself to seek the <span class="highlight">natural</span> process of law, I, as a member of Parliament, will ensure that he gets full help, if he feels he needs it, of good legal advice to undertake the process of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let there be no doubt at all that as far as I am concerned, and I hope I speak for all honourable senators on my side of the House, if any citizen in this country feels that he has been denied <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice let him come forward, produce the evidence and we will help him to get the full recourse of justice under the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The work of these groups has added much to our knowledge of the sea around us; but with the immensity of our coastline - over 12,000 miles - ranging as it does from temperate through sub-tropical to tropical zones it is clear that, if we are to make the best use of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources, our efforts in the field of marine science need to be strengthened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The growth in the population of the Australian Capital Territory, bringing with it a <span class="highlight">natural</span> and consequent requirement for a greater amount of legal advice and services, has brought about a development of the legal system in the Australian Capital Territory to the point that it now has reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the problem, if I can recall it from my earlier work, was in defining the park boundaries and obtaining what might be called a merger of the various interests which were the interests of people living in houses, people wanting <span class="highlight">natural</span> recreation, the needs of the water supply programme and water shed protection, the needs of the park and the needs of forestry in an area which has some substantial limits for a number of the purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The programme of the Committee is such that it will be necessary for it to sit through the recess - of course, that is <span class="highlight">natural</span> for any committee - but it would also appear that the Committee will be sitting on each Monday and Friday of the spring parliamentary session, and almost every week during the recess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The early settlers of New South Wales who were insistent that this land be kept in its <span class="highlight">natural</span> state were looking a long way ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The burden of my remarks is that with proper planning - I am not being aggressive towards the States - there is not the faintest reason why some of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> bushland oases cannot be protected and not sacrified to the bulldozer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only available information on future Soviet consumption of forest products suggests that, even if the norms of utilisation in mining construction, railroad transport, etc., are lowered by one and a half to two times, the national economy will need a yearly supply of more than thirty-five billion cubic feet, which exceeds the <span class="highlight">natural</span> productivity of the forest’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These considerations lead to the conclusion that countries in which <span class="highlight">natural</span> softwood resources are deficient would do well to develop softwood plantations, as is being done in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In making this assessment the Committee has, in 2 instances, compared the levels of radiation dose due to fallout with the dose received from <span class="highlight">natural</span> background to which populations have been exposed since the beginning of life on this earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are, I understand, many technical difficulties which prevent direct evaluation of any effects of radiation doses on experimental animals at low levels approaching that of <span class="highlight">natural</span> background radiation and even more so at the still lower levels resulting from fallout in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In part of its evaluation of the hazards to health of the 1971 French tests, the National Radiation Advisory Committee followed a practice, adopted by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, namely that of comparing the radiation doses from nuclear weapon tests with the doses inevitably received by the community from <span class="highlight">natural</span> background radiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average <span class="highlight">natural</span> background radiation dose to a person in the Australian communities is about 100 millirad per year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However the <span class="highlight">natural</span> background varies from place to place due to such factors as altitude and the amount of naturally occurring radioactive materia] in the soil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a given location, the annual dose due to <span class="highlight">natural</span> sources also varies from person to person duc to such factors as the materials used in the construction of buildings in which they live and work and the amount of time they spend indoors and out-of-doors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking all these factors into account the actual radiation dose due to <span class="highlight">natural</span> background radiation received by persons would vary, one from the other, from the annual average by up to about 10 millirad per year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the population living at altitude or in areas of high <span class="highlight">natural</span> radioactivity would receive annual radiation doses greater than the average by 50 per cent or more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the conservative assumption of direct proportionality between dose and biological effects, without a minimum or threshold dose, is applied it follows that this dose would have given rise as a total to less than 1 per cent of the same biological effects in each and every year which are due to the average <span class="highlight">natural</span> background radiation dose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any biological effects would have been less than those which would result from the variations which occur in <span class="highlight">natural</span> background radiation from place to place and for individual to individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This type of confrontation or conflict is becoming significant in every country, but perhaps nowhere more so than in this continent where there is now this tremendous drive for the exploration, exploitation and development of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that all States are concerned and have passed legislation declaring <span class="highlight">natural</span> forests and have surrounded them with all types of prohibitions on entry, on use and on the lighting of fires, and have expanded fire services, because this is a diminishing national asset which is extraordinarily precious and is virtually irreplaceable except over a long period of time, as nature has demonstrated to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am informed also that in one case the New South Wales Forestry Commission contemplates the elimination of a <span class="highlight">natural</span> eucalypt forest on the Boyd Plateau in the western Blue Mountains some 65 miles west of Sydney to enable the planting of pines for eventual milling at Oberon some 40 miles away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Democratic Labor Party feels that the Commonwealth should lay down as a matter of principle, so far as it lies within its constitutional power to do so, that the use of land for pine plantations should wherever possible be in areas of this kind rather than in areas which would involve the displacement of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> flora. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To me, ‘<span class="highlight">natural</span>’ is the interesting word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as <span class="highlight">natural</span> forests are concerned, I am afraid that I cannot speak with great knowledge of the situation in New South Wales or Queensland, but certainly in relation to the <span class="highlight">natural</span> forests which exist in my own State of Victoria and in Tasmania I am aware that there is great environmental interest if environment’ covers the regeneration of the type of forest which exists in <span class="highlight">natural</span> forests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in relation to <span class="highlight">natural</span> forests it would be a financial and commercial assessment as to whether the forest was of a type that could be productive or whether it was one which was best cleared, burned and planted with pinus radiata or one of the other pine species that have become established these days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps that idea would appeal to us if we lived nearby or if we lived in the heart of Sydney and rode once a year, or at least when there was a bandwagon, to a particular area and declared that the area should be left in its <span class="highlight">natural</span> state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first problem is the one that  Senator Webster  mentioned: What is a <span class="highlight">natural</span> forest? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Webster  does not know, but he could tell us many areas that are not <span class="highlight">natural</span> forests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is a <span class="highlight">natural</span> forest is beyond my knowledge, but those engaged in forestry work might have a knowledge as to what is a <span class="highlight">natural</span> forest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the amendment the only inquiry is into the clearing of <span class="highlight">natural</span> forests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There has to be an inquiry into the clearing of <span class="highlight">natural</span> forests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The State shall ensure that <span class="highlight">natural</span> forests shall not be cleared for planting softwoods unless the particular proposed clearing has beforehand been the subject of an environmental impact study . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, forests, whether <span class="highlight">natural</span> or man made, constitute one of man’s few renewable resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said: ‘So that the <span class="highlight">natural</span> wildlife and kangaroos from the cleared land can pass into the forest land.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Byrne  is quite concerned at the setting aside of any consideration of <span class="highlight">natural</span> forest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, in the absence of measures which let the States destroy willy-nilly <span class="highlight">natural</span> growth and animal life without affording any protection to them, one is forced into the position of supporting the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We should know all the arguments - the pros and cons - and draw the line somewhere between what we should do to protect the <span class="highlight">natural</span> fauna and flora and what is necessary - and there must be some necessity for destruction - for the purpose of the progress of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I regard this as the approach which we should make to most of such reports; that is, once the Senate has gone to the trouble of having a select committee investigate a subject, and matters flow from it - as they do in this report - the <span class="highlight">natural</span> course ought to be to send those recommendations to the appropriate committees in order that they will remain alive and that recommendations might come out of those committees in order to implement the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this country it is  necessary toremember always that it was –the changing of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> environment as: it was when discovered by people who .came from Europe in the early days which, has made it possible for what was once almost a desert to bloom and blossom in small parts today and give us a satisfactory way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That drop represents, as a result of the Government’s policy taken earlier this year, a <span class="highlight">natural</span> selling by overseas owners to Australian residents which has had the effect of reducing the overseas ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the honourable senator of the experience of the wool industry when synthetics were making vast inroads into the market of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> fibre and the expenditure at the present time on wool promotion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The environment had changed completely and absolutely by the intrusion of white settlers who brought with them new knowledge and experience and who were able for the first time to apply the advantages of capitalisation to the enormous <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of this country - resources which at that time had not been exploited, such as the mineral resources which no-one knew existed in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What we have to decide as a result of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> sympathy that we all feel and which I had already expressed without contest, without an interjection, which exists on all sides of the House, is to do something, perhaps in different ways, to help solve these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While opposing violence, I ask that there be in Australia a human understanding that all people who have been forced out of Iron Curtain countries have, in their hearts, a <span class="highlight">natural</span> hunger to form freedom bodies in the hope that one day they will return to their countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian industrial community, including not only those who arc the industrialists but also those who are working in the industry and who are dependent on it for their livelihood, has been concerned by the events which have been revealed in the last week or so relating to the construction of what may be described as the initial part of the reticulation of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas for Australia which is to be carried out not with pipelines manufactured from Australian steel by Australian industry but with Japanese steel imported by the Australian Gas Light Co. at a cost of about S54m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, naturally, has caused great concern in industry, to the unions and to the workers who could be affected by the loss of employment in the steel and pipelines industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Natural</span> gas is predicted to supply, in various ways, from 10 per cent up to perhaps 30 or 40 per cent of our fuel needs by the end of the century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>United States, where there is a developing shortage of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas, and Japan - that there will be a worldwide demand for <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and that, for a number of reasons, Australia will want to develop its utilisation of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost certainly it will embark upon reticulation of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My reading of the report is that all of those concerned with this development said that there had to be a national policy, that the Government had to be involved in the question of the transportation of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and that it could not be left to develop as have our railways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here is our programme - we will do the best we can to work out how these <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources can be developed and where the pipelines will go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one is dealing with the prospective energy requirements of a nation, of which <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas will be a important part, I do not think it is useful to divert this argument into what the constitutional powers may be because this is a subject which is fundamental to this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only is the supply and movement of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas fundamental but also the prosperity of the steel industry and industries associated with it and the livelihood of persons who depend on those industries are fundamental. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it comes from Japan is it to be paid for by the export of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas to Japan or in some other form? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A national decision should be made on these issues in the context of what is to be done in the development and piping of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, the Agreement which is now contemplated for conclusion between the Commonwealth and the States requires that the States shall take environmental factors rft to consideration when afforestation with softwoods is being considered, <span class="highlight">natural</span> areas are being interfered with and <span class="highlight">natural</span> forests are being destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But because of the Government’s ineptitude, Sydney has been deprived of the use of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas for a period of more than 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We recommend that a national pipelines policy be implemented immediately and that legislation be enacted - this may require the co-operation of the States - to regulate the construction and operation of pipelines for the carriage interstate or intra-State of oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From the layman’s point of view it has become clear over the last 3 or 4 years that <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas is going to become a major source of fuel in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government should have recognised the potential of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and realised that it was going to become a major source of fuel supply in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clearly, so far as the Australian Gas Light Co. is concerned, it is a matter of sour grapes because it missed out on some of the earlier exploratory rights in the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is prepared to subsidise the shipbuilding industry and many other industries; so why does it not take the initiative and attempt to get an Australian industry retooled so that it can carry out its responsibility to provide components for the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This proposed reference to the Standing Committee on Industry and Trade relates to the controversy that has arisen out of the supply of pipes for the Moomba to Sydney pipeline from the South Australian <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas field and provides an excellent opportunity for a thorough examination of the need for a national policy and planning on energy exploration, in this case <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a <span class="highlight">natural</span> consequence of these huge resources being available, the present concept is that the pipeline will go to Moomba and eventually out to Mareenie where there are enormous resources of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and to the tight sand oil resources in the Amadeus basin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One has only to examine the report on Australia’s <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Resources - Minerals, Forests, Water and Energy’, presented to the House of Representatives recently by the Minister for National Development  (Sir Reginald Swartz),  to appreciate the tremendous potential of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As indicated in that report, until recently half of our total energy requirements were met by petroleum products other than <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not just a matter of providing steel tubing; it is not just a matter of providing component parts for 780 miles of pipeline to handle 0.04 per cent, according to the estimates presented by  Sir Reginal  Swartz, of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas resources of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We in the Labor Party believe that <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas will afford the same stimulation; that it will play a very important part in the future development of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Reginald Swartz has recognised these facts and drawn attention to the great value of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas supplies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The point on which we join issue with the Government is that we believe there is a need to look at the social consequences as well as the economic consequences of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It means that we have regard for the planning of new cities and what part in that scheme of things <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas will play, lt means that surely we will have regard for the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the concept of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas pipeline ignores the Commonwealth’s interest in decentralisation and does not take into account any of the long term plans for regional development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe therefore that it is within the competence of the Senate to say that the Commonwealth should take some initiative to link the private development that is associated with <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas with the long term planning for the public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In point of fact, I recall that not so long ago  Senator Byrne  and some of his colleagues were quite vocal on the matter of the environment and the <span class="highlight">natural</span> habitat, and with the assistance of the Australian Labor Party they were successful in carrying a resolution that the Senate request the Government to have another look at its softwoods legislation because the environment was very much affected by it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, they invariably lead to towns, people and industry - the places where the markets are which will be of great value to the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is fair to say that in many ways the new Government has made giant strides in the direction of conserving our <span class="highlight">natural</span> species. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Notwithstanding, 1,294,000 persons were added to the population in 1972 due to <span class="highlight">natural</span> increase, the excess of births over deaths. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rate of <span class="highlight">natural</span> increase was 6.2 persons per thousand population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is <span class="highlight">natural</span> radiation and someone may be subjected to other radiation because that is unavoidable or because one deliberately seeks it for some beneficial purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular, we will regulate exploration, development, transportation, marketing and use of oil, <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and all related hydrocarbons We will also prevent the pollution of the ecology and the environment by fuel extraction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The world availability of petroleum and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas as prime sources of energy after a few decades is questionable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Moreover, these figures do not take into account the cost of potential deductions available to those companies which are not yet producing petroleum and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas, but will undoubtedly do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In aggregate, the contribution of public revenue to oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas exploration to date will be $4 1 9m - approximately 50 per cent - with more yet to be claimed when companies such as Woodside.Burmah Oil NL enter into production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With such a huge public contribution, it is staggering to note that no equity has been sought by our predecessors in office in crude oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In return for an exploration expenditure of about $843m, the greater part of which has been and will continue to be, borne by the Commonwealth Government, there has been already discovered by exploration in Australia, on-shore and off-shore, some 45 trillion cubic feet of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas, over 2 billion barrels of crude oil, which together with condensate and liquid petroleum gas have a gross value of over $14 billion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The importance to Japan not only of a country that has immense <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources - because both Russia and China may well have similar resources - but also of a country that is politically stable and capable of honouring contracts and delivering resources of a specific grade and volume at a particular time transcends other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This concept of a national pipeline system also takes account of wide issues - of defence, of decentralisation, of population growth, of national development, of the importance of interconnected supplies to meet increasing long term demands, emergency situations and the exhaustion of particular regional energy sources, and the possible export of liquefied <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of seabed areas and their exploitation or potential exploitation have become increasingly important in recent years, and with advancing technology that trend, no doubt, will continue at an accelerated pace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Similarly clause  11  makes it clear that the sovereign rights of Australia in respect of the exploration and exploitation of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of the continental shelf are vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The value of production of minerals recovered from the seabed so far is small when compared with that of oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Particular attention will be directed towards ensuring the conservation and preservation of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and of the marine and associated environments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To that end clause 88 empowers the Minister to cancel any permit or licence if he considers this to be in the interests of the safety of navigation or the conservation of <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources or otherwise in the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our main aim will continue to be that this legislation shall encourage efficient and adequate exploration and exploitation of our offshore resources and at the same time control operations in such a way as to ensure the conservation of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and the preservation of our marine environment to the common good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But now that there has been a change of Government and the present Government wants to take the <span class="highlight">natural</span> course of asserting its rights by legislation over these off-shore areas, the Opposition moves that the Bill be deferred until consultation takes place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill seeks to repeal provisions which give to the Attorney-General the power to deport persons who are not <span class="highlight">natural</span> born Australians - notwithstanding the fact that they may be naturalised Australians - and who have committed certain offences under the Crimes Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill seeks to assert the principle that all Australians, irrespective of whether they are <span class="highlight">natural</span> born or naturalised, have an equality under the law and should be treated equally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 emphasise that what these conditions do is to distinguish between Australians who are <span class="highlight">natural</span> born and Australians who are naturalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that naturalisation gives to an Australian citizen absolutely and without equivocation the same rights under the law as <span class="highlight">natural</span> born Australians possess under that very same law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is anolomous and offensive to suggest that some Australian citizens who are not <span class="highlight">natural</span> born may be deported at the discretion of the Attorney-General and we welcome therefore the opportunity when it is presented to us to indicate our complete support of the Government in the repeal of these provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But once we confer the citizenship of this country upon a person who has come to this country as an immigrant and who has resided in this country we owe to that person 2 things: We owe him the obligation, firstly, that we will treat him as an equal of persons who are <span class="highlight">natural</span>-born Australians and subject him to no penalties, prohibitions or disabilities which are different from those to which the <span class="highlight">natural</span>-born citizens are subjected; and, secondly, that we will not deport him to a country where he may be dealt with not on the basis of his conduct but simply on the basis of his political opinions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have seen a host of non-<span class="highlight">natural</span>-born Australians subjected to police raids and police searches over the past weeks, the like of which this country has never experienced in the whole of its history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attitudes have changed and the Government and the Opposition are as one in maintaining that there is an absolute equality of treatment which must be accorded to all Australian citizens irrespective of whether they be <span class="highlight">natural</span> born or naturalised and that Australian’s who are not <span class="highlight">natural</span> born Australians should not be deported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We acknowledge the recognition, by the present Government of the steps which the preceding Government has taken and in which we take some pride and we naturally would support the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All honourable senators ought to take pride in the fact that generally there has been a bipartisan approach in regard to this type of aircraft offence, and it is only <span class="highlight">natural</span> that the Opposition would wish this Bill  a  speedy passage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But with the development of technology, with the demand for new materials and the discovery of vast <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources on the sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore we can expect to find that there will be a continuing necessity for Australia to be adverting from time to time to its boundary relations and its sovereignty over areas adjacent to the vast Australian coastline, as other nations wish to exploit the <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of a marine character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the other place the responsible Minister, the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor),  when introducing this Bill stated that it seeks to establish a Pipeline Authority for the transmission of petroleum, <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and other hydrocarbons, by interstate ring main pipeline systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its essential factor, it is carrying petroleum, <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and other hydrocarbons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a few examples in Australia of pipelines carrying articles other than petroleum, <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless, the expansion of this system could go beyond the carriage of petroleum and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is concern at this monopoly power over the sale of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the power given to the Authority to subscribe for or otherwise acquire shares in a public company, which seems to us to give it power to take over such companies and, in effect, effectively to nationalise the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas industry and to make it a total captive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It rather looks to us as if there will be a considerable delay in the scheme in providing <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and energy to <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt that there is a growing necessity for a national policy in relation to the conveyance of these great <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of Australia which are being found now in greater abundance both on-shore and off-shore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a Western Australian, naturally I think firstly of the prospects that the discoveries, of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas off the north-west shelf of Australia present for the development of the Pilbara region of Western Australia, a region ‘already famous for the richness of its mineral deposits, particularly iron ore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s object in creating this Pipeline Authority is ostensibly to provide a cheap, convenient and efficient means of conveying the <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of petroleum from one part of Australia to another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would be the point of a link of that kind when already there are perfectly adequate sources of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas for the eastern seaboard in areas such as Moonie, Gidgealpa and Bass Strait? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be wrong, at this stage certainly, to be draining the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas sources off the north-west shelf for consumption in Sydney when those resources present a golden opportunity for regional development in the area in which they exist, such as in the region of Pilbara. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I well imagine that there could be, or should be, serious objections from some members of the public to a pipeline being built in their area, or through a particular place of <span class="highlight">natural</span> beauty, or where some local interest would be destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recommend that a national pipelines policy be implemented immediately and that the legislation be enacted - this may require the co-operation of the States - to regulate the construction and operation of pipelines for the carrying interstate or intra-State of oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that Sydney has needed <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is simple and has the clear and definite purpose to set up an authority’ with adequate powers to construct and operate a major public utility having the responsibility of making one of our greatest <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources available to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By that I mean that the farms could be farming <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of all descriptions such as gas, oil, minerals or any other resources with which our country seems to be so richly endowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will also see that our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources - our iron ore deposits, our steel making processes and the long line that goes from the raw metal to the completed pipeline - will be, as far as possible, utilised by Australians for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Planned supplies of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas will be made available to Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total concept will provide a completely interconnected grid system, ensuring back-up supplies in case of interruption by, <span class="highlight">natural</span> calamities or exhaustion of supply from an individual source. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple purpose of this measure is to set up an authority with adequate powers to construct and operate a major public utility having the responsibility of making one of our greatest <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources available to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Arabian States of the world were not in a similar position, but this <span class="highlight">natural</span> resource had to be exported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one speaks about the preservation of <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources one could even recall the turn of the century and the schism that split the Republican Party in the United States when there was a changeover from  President  Theodore Roosevelt to Howard Taft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even in those days - and I say this with deference to  Senator Webster  - it was not a case of socialists being in the wings and deciding what should be done with <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a particular reason for saying that because at the present time in the United States the Government is extracting from the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas industry and the oil industry a pretty sizable rake-off which is going into the celebrated Land Water Act which set up a repository of feed-back money to the States, be it for such a mundane subject as better sewerage treatment works, for conservation or the acquisition of vast tracts of forest land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sincerely believe that whether it be a State enterprise or a private business enterprise a levy must be imposed to protect not so much <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources as the <span class="highlight">natural</span> environment so that people can at least experience the good aspects of the Australian continent and sec that they are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has indicated quite clearly to me in letters that the policy of the United States Senate towards more and more demands for conservation is that instead of the taxpayer having to pay for them, it will dig more deeply into the pockets of the big exploiters of resources, d have no doubt that under this Bill we will be able to keep a very effective hand on the tiller so far as the income from our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that this legislation represents another milestone to Australia which is well and truly protecting its <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the face of it, it appears to be setting up regulatory authority to establish throughout Australia an interstate ring main pipeline for the carriage and distribution of petroleum and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the domestic area there is the real possibility that <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas will reduce domestic fuel bills by anything from 20 per cent to 35 per cent and in the industrial area by 30 per cent to double that percentage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas presents a very important new resource to the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That definition shows that the Authority does not deal just with pipelines; it is not just an Authority which deals with oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the <span class="highlight">natural</span> institution to do this and money would have been saved if it had constructed the pipeline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition would not in any way oppose the idea of a pipeline authority in a regulatory sense which is set up to see that throughout Australia there is a network of pipelines carrying in an equitable fashion petroleum and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas to the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite have the audacity to say that the best way to establish the pipeline is to leave it to the same speculators who are not concerned with the building of the pipeline or with the conservation of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> energy resources but are concerned merely with making a kill upon the stock exchange by promoting and by selling shares in a company which will build such a pipeline, to the disadvantage - it has been proven to be the disadvantage - of many thousands of young and small investors and of many investors who will place more than a small amount in such companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no such thing as free competition - allowing the price of a commodity to reach its own <span class="highlight">natural</span> level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Authority is set up for the transmission of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been shown by previous speakers, by surveys and by exploration that there are vast areas and vast resources of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee turns next to a statement by  Mr W.  W. Pettingell,now  Sir William  Pettingell who, I understand, is  Chairman  of the Australian <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Gas Development Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time, we have a situation in which cities such as Adelaide, Perth, Melbourne, and Brisbane already are connected to <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas with pipelines supplying them from the various gas fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that because the Bill allows the Authority to buy and sell hydrocarbons - liquids and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I presume that the Authority will set the price for transmission and also will set the price that it is prepared to pay for the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas at the well-head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the Authority could charge excessive prices for the transmission of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas, particularly to competitors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a consequence of this freeze and the high cost of getting funds into Australia for exploration, a complete killing of the incentive for further exploration of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources could occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation must not develop where the Authority has complete control of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister went on: of defence, of decentralisation, of population growth, of national development, of the importance of interconnected supplies to meet increasing long term  demands, emergency situations and the exhaustion of particular regional energy sources, and the possible export of liquefied <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has had, of course, the discovery of petroleum and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What Australia may need in future is the construction of a network of pipelines to transport petrol, oil or <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas in its liquefied form or in whatever form it may be from various places where it has been discovered in and off Australia to points where it is needed for distribution on the Australian mainland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People in Western Australia, particularly in Perth, have <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The coal gas was so much more efficient than the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas that it is unbelievable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing to say that the people of Sydney will willingly accept <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas when it gets there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they may have the same opinion as many people in Western Australia have, and that is that the coal gas was far better than the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will be involving the country in the expenditure of millions more dollars in order to convert the present systems to <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should see what happens when <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas is connected to a city and whether the factories will use it willingly or whether they will complain that they are not getting the same value as previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transmission of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas by an interstate ring main to ensure continuity of supplies and uniformity of price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, immediately <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas has become available to those gas companies, they have converted their services to <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas, Therefore, very little gas derived from coal is used in areas to which a <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas supply is available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Natural</span> gas is a cheaper and more efficient product, I believe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a pipeline grid were set up it is within imagination that at some time a national authority may take, over the pipelines that already exist for the transportation to Melbourne of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas which has been discovered adjacent to the brown coal fields in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we are seeing discoveries of reserves of fuel in the form of oil in Bass Strait, in particular, from which most of Australia’s present supplies are coming, we should not overlook the other <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources which are largely falling into abeyance as a result of the easier usage of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is simple and has the clear and definite purpose to set up an Authority with adequate powers to construct  and  operate a major public utility having the responsibility of making one  of  our greatest <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources available to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, let us assume that the Authority wishes to build in an area where there is great concern for the environmental factors or for the preservation of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> beauty or fauna of an area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the <span class="highlight">natural</span> history of public authorities which have no responsibility to the people is to ignore or to ride roughshod over the views of those who seek to protect the environment, whereas Parliament, which is more subject to pressures and more subject to the views of the people, would be inclined to listen to these complaints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only <span class="highlight">natural</span> that we should have concentrated our initial efforts on establishing the basis for understanding and co-operation in our own geographical region, but it has no way been our wish or intention to underestimate or neglect the importance of our ties with the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Similar trends are evident in Western Europe, while Japan has long been  a  heavy importer as she lacks <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources  of  her own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have taken numerous steps with a view to securing greater Australian and government’ control and supervision of the use of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Australia has asserted its sovereign rights to explore and exploit the <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of its continental shelf out to the outer shelf of the continental margin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">natural</span> reaction straight away, and the one which the Government no doubt wants to encourage, will be to try to cut back on prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that this is the Government which paid lip service to freedom, the liberty of the individual, the right of the individual to <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice to set up an arbitrary tribunal such as this, then I do not know the meaning of the words. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I can only regret that the Government, notwithstanding the flush of its election victory and knowing what its platform and policy stated, should have directed the work of the Committee in that way because 1 feel that we undoubtedly would have gained more from the <span class="highlight">natural</span> evolution of this Committee’s work along the lines of the original terms of reference which had been sent to it if it had been able to come forward with what it felt was the most appropriate remedy in the circumstances as it found them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I wanted any further reason to persuade me to follow the course that is recommended by  Senator Withers  it is, again, a <span class="highlight">natural</span> deference, which too often is denied to me but which I still claim, for consideration of my colleagues’ point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that regional growth centres must have a sound economic base because, pretty well without exception, all instances of successful decentralisation or regional development have as a background a history of <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources, locational advantages in respect of transport or some other element of economic assistance or incentive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite any faults which there might have been in our method of administration since we were elected to Government on 2 December last - I suppose it is only <span class="highlight">natural</span> that there must be faults because we are mere mortals - this Government is getting on with the job of building a nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Substantially it is a new proposal to ensure that <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas supplied by the Authority is available at a gatevalve, delivery price that is at all times uniform throughout Australia after allowing for differences in calorific values. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So the situation is, as we now have it, that the House of Representatives has disagreed with the first and second amendments; it has agreed with the third amendment; it has agreed with the fourth amendment; and it has made an amendment to clause 13 to give uniformity in the price of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas to all users throughout Australia, allowing for differences of value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The French officials have in their Part ‘B’ sought to demonstrate that French atmospheric nuclear weapon tests in the Pacific are without hazard by invoking dose limits recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (the ICRP), by arguing that the radiation doses from those tests are small compared with those from other man-made sources of ionizing radiation and by comparing those doses with those inevitably received by populations from <span class="highlight">natural</span> background radiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now refer to <span class="highlight">natural</span> background radiation to which populations, from the beginning of life on earth, have been inevitably exposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The French Government has argued that the radiation doses to the Australian population and to other populations from its nuclear weapon testing in the atmosphere, are but small fractions of hte annual <span class="highlight">natural</span> background doses and, indeed, that the radiation doses from the radio-active fall-out from those tests are embraced by the variations which occur in <span class="highlight">natural</span> background doses even within a large city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the assumption that the risk of radiation injury is directly proportional to accumulated dose, it follows that exposure from <span class="highlight">natural</span> background carries a probability of causing some somatic or hereditary injury, which would be present even without the addition of man-made exposure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, provided there is no synergistic effect between irradiation and other factors, the total risk of injury will be the sum of “the risk from irradiation (from either <span class="highlight">natural</span> or- man-made sources) plus the risks resulting from environmental and other cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total radiation scene for the Australian population involves <span class="highlight">natural</span> background radiation, it involves man-made sources of radiation which have direct benefit to the Australian population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As he stated on 12 April, in aggregate, the contribution to date of public revenue to oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas exploration alone has been $419m - approximately SO per cent of the total so expended - with more yet to be claimed for which no equity was sought by our predecessors in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, we have become enriched too by the fact that circumstances forced us outside that ambit and we began to attract into Australia people from other European countries who had differing cultures from those of the people with whom we had a <span class="highlight">natural</span> allegiance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It cannot be foreseen that citizens who come to Australia from other countries must necessarily have a clash of allegiance if they maintain - and they cannot deny this - a <span class="highlight">natural</span> feeling of allegiance to the country from which they come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among these differences are those of area, climate, topography, <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources, size and distribution of population and productive capacity, and levels of income and expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is <span class="highlight">natural</span> and probably in a sense it is desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Federal Government sat down to enact legislation to implement the grant of industrial power given it by the founding fathers there was a climate abroad which made a system of conciliation plus compulsory arbitration seem a <span class="highlight">natural</span> one to adopt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>(if <span class="highlight">natural</span> persons, as I am instructed they are) I am asked to deal with by question (c)) the principal question of concern seems to be whether the amendments can properly be characterised as retrospective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I  am able to tell you,  Mr President,  and honourable senators that  I  was able to recommend to the Government, in the light of the approaches now being taken to the administration of justice, particularly the requirements of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice, that the decision given in 1942 should not be allowed to stand today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was a denial of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice to those 2 gentlemen, not so insofar as the finding of guilt was concerned because that was a finding by the Committee of Privileges after hearing evidence, but when the 2 gentlemen concerned were not called upon before punishment was imposed to show cause why they should be punished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the extreme opposition to the use of overseas capital, particularly in the oil and mining industries, by the Minister for Minerals and Energy, what assurance will the South Australian Government have that the Federal Government will not create any impediment to the supply of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas to this industry by way of the Pipeline Authority or other means if this industry is finally established by an overseas company? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only comment I would make is that the Government’s intention is to ensure that Australia’s <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources are for the benefit of Australians and not of overseas interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I am asking, and this is the point of the question this evening, is that if this <span class="highlight">natural</span> interpretation of 2 very clear statements made by the Prime Minister is not a correct statement that the Government say so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate referred this matter to the Committee late last year, following the confusion surrounding the announcement that the Australian Gas Light Co.

    <p>I know that there is a <span class="highlight">natural</span> concern, particularly in these days of rising land prices, the exploitation of land and a tremendous capital accretion in the value of land, by governments to make land available to the public at large at a reasonable price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has this Government thought that by the time we may have got around to this- not having done any homework at all and not having, I suspect, even consulted the Australian Atomic Energy Commission in Australia and certainly having no blueprint- and that by the time we had got another of these expensive situations like the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas pipeline but which will be twelve times as dear, the world supply probably will be in glut? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The difficulty would be that, if we did have people representing interest groups in this way, we would have a son of multi-party miniature parliament with the leader of the State school group and the  deputy  leader of the private school group, and possibly a whip or two thrown in to count the numbers and work out who had instructed whom and who had made deals- all things which are not wrong in themselves but which I believe are a <span class="highlight">natural</span> concomitant of having any organisation constituted in this manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A Bill substantially the same as this was introduced into the Parliament by the previous Government in April 1971, along with a Bill to amend the Continental Shelf (Living <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Resources) Act 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Cancellation of a licence for contravention of a condition, or if the holder has been convicted of an offence against this Act, the Continental Shelf (Living <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Resources) Act or a State or Territory fisheries law, is provided for in clause 7. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to amend certain of the machinery provisions of the Continental Shelf (Living <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Resources) Act to ensure more effective administration of the legislation and, in conjunction with amendments proposed in the Fisheries Bill which I have just introduced, to bring the principles embodied in the 2 Acts into uniformity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators are aware, the main purpose of the Continental Shelf (Living <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Resources) Act is to enable the fullest possible protection to be given to the living resources of the continental shelf of Australia and the external territories, including the Great Barrier Reef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Alongside the search for <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and for oil we must be asking ourselves these things: Should we, in fact, be conserving our coal or should we be using it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The territorial seas bordering Australia and the sea-bed thereof with all its <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources are those of the Commonwealth, not those of any Federal State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dominion over the sea-bed and the <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of the whole of the Continental Shelf commencing at low-water mark, and the right to explore and exploit these, or permit others to do so, is vested exclusively in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because there has been a substantial increase in the number of broadcasting stations and television stations and because the workload now thrown on the Broadcasting Control Board is significantly greater than it was a decade ago, it is only <span class="highlight">natural</span> that an increase in the revenue required to enable the Broadcasting Control Board to continue to give the very effective service that it gives to the Australian people is necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was common knowledge that endeavours were being made by great corporations outsideno doubt, with very great foresight on their part- to see that they got control of the development of Australia’s <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and energy resources with a view to using those resources elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So that the very treaty that was produced by the national Parliament and the national government away back in 1958, in the time of the Liberal-Country Party Government, in describing the continental shelf said that it is that part of the seabed extending from a point from the margin of the territorial sea; and it said also that the coastal State- that is Australia- in its national entity exercises sovereign rights over the continental shelf for the purpose of exploring and exploiting its <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that for a long time Australia suffered from what I call industry stand-off and that people regarded primary industry and commerce as the <span class="highlight">natural</span> enemies of manufacturing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it the desire of the Senate that the Fisheries Bill and the Continental Shelf (Living <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Resources) Bill be debated cognately? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Continental Shelf (Living <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Resources) Bill is on very similar lines to the Fisheries Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of the Continental Shelf (Living <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Resources) Bill is to amend certain of the machinery provisions of the Continental Shelf (Living <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Resources) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Continental Shelf (Living <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Resources) Bill contains a provision concerning the forfeiture of foreign boats similar to that which appears in the Fisheries Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall look at this matter more closely at the Committee stage with a view to bringing into line both the provision in the Fisheries Act and that contained in the Continental Shelf (Living <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Resources) Bill in relation to the rigidity and the mandatory nature of the terms of forfeiture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his second reading speech on the Continental Shelf (Living <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Resources) Bill the Minister for Primary Industry  (Senator Wriedt)  made one statement which is not clear and to which I would like to draw his attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said:  the main purpose of the Continental Shelf (Living <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Resources) Act is to enable the fullest possible protection to be given to the living resources of the continental shelf of Australia and the external territories, including the Great Barrier Reef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The world energy crisis highlights major world reliance on oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas for its energy needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr G.  A. Wagner, Senior Managing Director of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Companies says 70 per cent of this should come from oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas currently provide about 50 per cent of Australia’s energy needs and there is every indication that this figure will increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Assuming its ready availability throughout the country, this would be sufficient to meet the demands for <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas for about 30 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With complacent reliance on unlimited oil supplies, nations have ignored research and development of alternative energy sources, such as <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas, coal and ultimately, uranium and solar energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas will, however, remain major energy sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other provisions in the Bill designed specifically to promote Australian ownership and control of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources by requiring the Authority to assist mining undertakings to get off the ground and thereby help them to remain Australian and save them from falling into foreign hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This concept is that the continental shelf is the <span class="highlight">natural</span> prolongation under the sea of the land mass of the coastal state, out to the lower edge of the margin, where it slopes down to and merges in the deep ocean floor or abyssal plain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These companies would normally look to a larger operating company for the necessary help, but local Australian companies have a limited capacity to take on new ventures of this type, and therefore, they find themselves turning to overseas companies which thereby secure an interest in our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second permanent long time source of energy is clearly solar energy, and clearly in the next 30, 40 or 50 years solar energy will be developed by a direct energy conversion process so, either by fusion or solar energy, the world will move into a stage where the need for energy for electrical power generation will not depend on coal, oil, <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas or uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If that is so, then certainly uranium, coal, oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas will not have the kind of massive use that they have today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Specifically, what is our policy for taking <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas, processing it and using it for liquid petroleum gas in the event of Australia needing to convert our motor cars to LPG fuel use if we are faced with a shortage of indigenous oil? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has no policy at all for the development of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister, in introducing this Bill, said that the Bill was in conformity with the Government’s policy of Australian ownership and control of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is our opinion that the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 enacted for the purpose of ensuring the legal effectiveness of authorities to explore for or to exploit the petroleum resources of Australia’s Continental Shelf, falls short of its goal and leaves much to be desired in its attempt to provide for the development in the national interest of an Australian off-shore petroleum and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>to regulate the construction and operation of pipelines for the carriage interstate or intra-State of oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps we ought to remember also some of the history of so called private enterprise in relation to the supply of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas to New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, the main authorities in Sydney decided that they would do some drilling for <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas on their own behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the people of New South Wales were deprived of the opportunity to use <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policies adopted for the development of an Australian oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas industry have caused continuing increases in the price which the motoring public is required to pay for petrol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, the householder being provided with <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas is paying more for this fuel than would be payable if, as suggested to the Committee, a pricing formula for <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas- irrespective of where it is produced- similar to that used by the United States of America Federal Power Commission, were adopted in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Exploration increased and in 1960 the associated group found the first of many small <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas fields in the Roma area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the governments of Canada, France, Italy, Norway, the Argentine, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Iran, Iraq, India, Japan, Indonesia and New Zealand all have taken an active part in the development of their <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and set up instrumentalities similar in varying degrees to the one that is proposed to be established by the legislation currently before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer  Senator Carrick  and, I think,  Senator Young  and one or two others to clause 8 of the Bill which states quite clearly that this Bill is intended to be a means by which we will co-operate with the private sector, but we will not co-operate with overseas companies which are here to exploit our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: Why has this man, who before Labor’s defeat at the polls on Saturday, was supposedly concerned that too little emphasis had been put on the defence of the western seaboard, perpetuated the situation in which the defence of Western Australia with a long and relatively uninhabited coastline, containing much if not most of this country’s <span class="highlight">natural</span> wealth has rested on one Air Force base, a down graded naval base and one SAS unit? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me inevitable, <span class="highlight">natural</span>, normal and appropriate for a man- it could be a woman in the world in which we live today- who accepts this highest office in the land and who serves the whole of the people of this nation to be able on his retirement to keep at that high level thereafter as one of the elder statesmen of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government welcomed offers from insurance organisations to discuss the inclusion of cover for <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters in housing insurance policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An examination will also be made of questions relating to insurance of crops and livestock against <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say merely this: The Democratic Labor Party has as part of its Federal policy, and always has had, that there should be a Federal secretariat to handle the questions of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters in Australia are epidemic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is either a <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster by way of flood, drought or cyclone or, perhaps, where  Senator McAuliffe  comes from on the Gold Coast, by substantial beach erosion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a very reasonable and proper provision and one which I hope every government and any government would take up, because <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters in this country must be treated as of regular and expected occurrence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we can move to meet them without these ad hoc methods which now characterise all our approaches to <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the recent <span class="highlight">natural</span> flood disasters around Australia, would the Postmaster-General give consideration to this commendable idea? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The functions of this Authority will be to explore for and develop our petroleum and mineral resources, and to assist in implementing the Government’s policy of promoting maximum Australian ownership and control of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and resource industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will realise the significance of the role of the Australian transcontinental <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas pipeline which can raise Australia’s usage of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas as a fuel, in substitution for imported crude oil, from 6 per cent to the industrialised world average of 21 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout the world today, the major nations and, above all, the multi-national oil companies, are realising the inter-relationship of crude oil, black and brown coal, <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and its hydrocarbon liquids. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With this expose of world energy pricing, honourable senators will clearly understand the implacable resolve of the first truly independent Australian national government to promote and protect Australian ownership and control of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> energy and mineral resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a disgrace that the <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of this nation are substantially controlled by overseas interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition parties, when they were in Government, facilitated in every way the opportunities for foreign interests to dominate the exploration for and the exploitation of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources, without serious thought of their obligation to preserve the national identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even with the <span class="highlight">natural</span> movements in population and the entry of 1 8-year-olds onto the electoral scene, the election results still reflected, with uncanny accuracy, the preferences of the electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator has shown during his time in this Senate a very great interest in the <span class="highlight">natural</span> animals of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that the honourable senator, having said what he did about the Labor Party and its rural activities and having at heart the interests of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> animals of this country, would have said something regarding the representation in this Parliament of people who live in the isolated areas of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some inequalities in the distribution but these are accepted as being fair since to change them would mean ignoring some of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> unities of towns or cities or of areas unified by easy communications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The alternative is to wait for another 10 years during which time some of the city slickers and developers will have got in for their chop and will have ruined much of the Northern Territory or, if they have not ruined it, they will have obtained ironclad leases and the <span class="highlight">natural</span> rights of the Territorians will have been denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Equality of representation, it is argued, is a <span class="highlight">natural</span> corollary of State representation . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The project has been developed with careful consideration for the protection and enhancement of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measures designed to protect the <span class="highlight">natural</span> environment will include a soil conservation program to reduce erosion in the catchment area and sediment deposit in Lake Burley Griffin; the preservation of permanent geological features including the London Bridge; a <span class="highlight">natural</span> limestone bridge over Burra Creek which is a geological feature with tourist potential; and the undergrounding of pipelines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People want more than they need; this is a <span class="highlight">natural</span> human characteristic, and the Government should take note of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a <span class="highlight">natural</span> role for government in health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it is to implement the Government’s policy of promoting maximum Australian ownership and control of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>above all, the multi-national oil companies, are realising the inter-relationship of crude oil, black and brown coal, <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and its hydrocarbon liquids. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So one must question how far they will go in the area of transportation of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will perceive 2 constant themes in our mineral and mining policies-the preservation of Australian ownership and the maximising of benefits to the Australian people from the sale of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister spoke of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources which are substantially controlled by overseas interests and of the off-shore leases which greatly favour some overseas companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government proposed the Petroleum and Minerals Authority in the first place because it was legitimately concerned at what was happening to the <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But local Australian companies have a limited capacity to take on new ventures of this type and therefore find themselves turning to overseas companies which thereby secure an interest in our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention these matters only to indicate that what we discovered in the way of petroleum, <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and crude oil flowed from the fact that we had a joint scheme in which the Commonwealth and the States were able to work together and lay down rules which were satisfactory to each partner in the Commonwealth-State arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister may, if, in his opinion, it is necessary in the interests of safety of navigation or of the conservation of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of the off-shore zone, or otherwise in the public interest, - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been some fall-off in the work force because of <span class="highlight">natural</span> attrition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say, in no criticism of those <span class="highlight">natural</span> demands, that the wage earner today, faced with the rapid acceleration of prices- an acceleration well in excess of 20 per cent- has only one recourse at this moment and that is to plead for more and more nominal wages and for the snowball to roll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that is perfectly <span class="highlight">natural</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>They are the same gentlemen who voted not so many years ago to give away, as estimated by one of their own members, literally hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas resources around the coasts of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The maximum penalty the Court will be able to determine will be $250,000 in the case of a corporation and $50,000 in the case of a <span class="highlight">natural</span> person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the AIDC they provide an organisation which can do no more than coordinate large private investment projects or encourage smaller ones to influence them in the direction of Australian ownership and to assist manufacture, processing treatment, transportation or distribution of goods, or the development or use of <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources or technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the mining company has appealed directly to the Privy Council, thereby giving British judges the right to determine this important environment issue, will the Attorney-General give urgent consideration to offering financial help to the Wyong Council in its endeavours to retain this valuable <span class="highlight">natural</span> area for the people of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is <span class="highlight">natural</span> that, with the nation’s economic and social development, there should be a parallel development of the financial machinery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have today, on the admission of the Government itself, inflation which is wage or cost push; that is, inflation brought about because the <span class="highlight">natural</span> demands for nominally higher wages chasing inflation have beaten productivity and are therefore forcing prices up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Whitlam went on to say that in a letter to all Premiers dated 27 February he had outlined the arrangements for financial assistance from the Australian Government to the States in the event of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole purpose of the Petroleum and Minerals Authority legislation being brought in by this Government is to protect the interests of Australians in their own <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, the blanket condemnation of the scheme produced- as a reasonably <span class="highlight">natural</span> reaction- a blanket defence of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The problems we have seen in so many other places are <span class="highlight">natural</span> human problems that exist when there is no restraint on the use that is made of the services which people demand because they pay 1.35, 2 or 10 per cent, or whatever percentage of their taxable income is needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This legislation proposes the creation of a Petroleum and Minerals Authority whose functions will be to explore for, and to develop, Australia’s petroleum and mineral resources, and to assist in implementing the Government’s policies of promoting Australian ownership and control of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and resource industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In today’s world, the ever growing energy crisis highlights the world reliance on oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas for energy needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is in no small measure due to the quadrupling of oil prices that a threat is posed to the economic viability and foreign exchange reserves of some of the world’s major industrial powers, which have complacently relied on unlimited cheap oil imports, and have ignored research and development of alternative energy sources, such as <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas, coal, and ultimately uranium and solar energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Other provisions in the Bill are designed specifically to promote Australian ownership and control of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources, by requiring the Authority to assist weaker mining undertakings to get off the ground, and achieve cash-flow, thereby helping  them to remain  Australian, and saving them from falling into foreign hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The specific cases are uranium, crude oil, <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and black coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the case of crude oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas it well exceeds 70 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is only 15 per cent Australian equity in the consortium holding off-shore exploration rights on the North West Continental Shelf of Western Australia, where 142,000 square miles of one of the world ‘s largest potential <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas areas are held by it- an area beyond the full capacity of even the largest company to intensively explore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The normal pattern operating in so many comparable countries will be observed by a partnership between the national Government providing <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and experienced explorers providing the risk capital, technology and expertise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a matter for serious national concern that we are confronted with a situation such as now exists in relation to Australia’s <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government and the State governments already have complete control and complete ownership of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is <span class="highlight">natural</span> and inevitable and government authorities have to treat with the companies in the same terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, it will expand the search for, and facilitate the development of the nation’s resources of hydrocarbons, especially crude oil, and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and the integration of the use of the hydrocarbons including coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This BUI which has raised so much opposition from the Liberal and Country Parties is designed so that we may explore and develop the petroleum and mineral resources in Australia and to permit the maximum ownership and control of Australia’s <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas we have instituted since we have been in office a national pipeline grid which will supply people across the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources are not the exclusive preserve of State governments whose responsibility is limited by geographical boundaries which were fixed by imperial legislators 2 centuries ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Therefore they find themselves turning to overseas companies, which thereby secure an interest in our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The essential issue is what return are the Australian people going to obtain from the exploitation of the country’s own <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This country has oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas which provides approximately 50 per cent of our energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to this we have <span class="highlight">natural</span> oil which supplies some 70 per cent of our needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the current rate of consumption our <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas resources will probably last for the next 30 years plus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those countries are not worried about government participation in <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and oil projects but members opposite fear it because they believe it will take profits away from their friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources are the gift of God; private ownership of them is against <span class="highlight">natural</span> and public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The program I have outlined represents the Australian Government’s contribution aimed at encouraging <span class="highlight">natural</span> adjustment already under way within the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is <span class="highlight">natural</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Though <span class="highlight">natural</span> enough and, in view of the unions’ immense bargaining and intimidatory powers, almost inevitable, this has bedevilled, and is continuing to bedevil, the country’s economic stability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it can be said that this is an omission from the Bill, whether it was done by design, as a result of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> thinking of the Attorney-General about trade practices, or whether it was done from a political point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I referred to a man who in the <span class="highlight">natural</span> course of business has built up a market which gives him a <span class="highlight">natural</span> predominance in a market so that he has an advantage over a new competitor or an old competitor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This refers to either a corporate body or a <span class="highlight">natural</span> person- is not excused from furnishing information or producing a document in pursuance of this section on the ground that the information or document might tend to incriminate him, but his answer to any question asked in the notice, or his furnishing of any other information in pursuance of the notice, is not admissible in evidence against him in any criminal proceedings other than proceedings under this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are excluding the <span class="highlight">natural</span> persons such as directors or officers because we are relying upon the power relating to corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>However, we are omitting the <span class="highlight">natural</span> persons and applying this clause only to corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are exempting the <span class="highlight">natural</span> persons, although  Senator Greenwood  saw fit to expose them to the threat of prosecution and to the use of the information against them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He does not answer what I have put, that is, that we have gone to the point of exempting from the kind of provision that he had in his legislation <span class="highlight">natural</span> persons so that no individual would be liable to have used against him in a criminal proceeding, even under this Bill, information which had been furnished in pursuance of its provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see the <span class="highlight">natural</span> consequence of the decline in the importance of the role and of the ability of local government to discharge its functions in the fact that able and conscientious people in the community-the type of people that one would want to see in local government- are now declining in greater numbers to involve themselves in a system for which they can claim only a mediocre performance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been told that the reason for the delay in implementing the new scheme is that the number of waterside workers in the various outports of Australia still has to be reduced by about one thousand, and that the longer the present scheme runs so the number will be reduced by <span class="highlight">natural</span> wastage through resignation and retirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fairly <span class="highlight">natural</span> to presume that their attitude to the establishment of enrichment plants in Australia would not be likely to contribute significantly to our capacity to sell our product in that form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>to explore for, and to develop, Australia’s petroleum and mineral resources, and to assist in implementing the Government’s policies of promoting Australian ownership and control of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and resource industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told that when the Labor Government came into office its policies would be more understandable; there would be less industrial strife; the relationship between unions and government was that of <span class="highlight">natural</span> partners; and we would see an era of industrial goodwill which Australia had never before experienced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is highly important that the wheat industry in this country remain attractive because it is one of those industries in which our <span class="highlight">natural</span> advantages are quite superb, in which our history as a producer ranks second to none. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So it is quite <span class="highlight">natural</span> where they would cut down on expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What of the farmer, the man who has struggled, the person who has been prepared to battle all sorts of <span class="highlight">natural</span> odds in his attempt to prosper and to contribute in his own way? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is decentralisation based on <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources which exist in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, we had a base of <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources to work from and in South Australia through the years we achieved decentralisation- not for a year or two and not with an unhappy sort of situation of conscription towards a given area, but due to a voluntary desire of people to go to the areas because things were being offered which would give a decent way of life and assure a sound economic background. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the Australian economy is still in pretty fair shapeliving standards are high, the level of employment is still (by any past standards) high, we still have our great <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources, and we have largely escaped the consequences of the international oil crisis, . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Given this background it was <span class="highlight">natural</span> that accompanying the strategy adopted in the last Budget was an element designed to guard against the future development of excess demand pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would certainly support any Bill which  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack introduced into this House to stop anything being erected on the site of Capital Hill because  I  think that, as it relates to the other hills in the city of Canberra, it is much better as a <span class="highlight">natural</span> object without any human edifice on it at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So 1 put it, as a very practical matter, that the Camp Hill site should commend itself to members of the Senate for the very reasons which I have expressed, namely, that it can be the site for a building which is related physically to this building and with which there can be a <span class="highlight">natural</span> human ebb and flow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I put it to the honourable senators that it is very <span class="highlight">natural</span> that buildings should have a balance, one with the other, and that there should not be an overwhelming emphasis on one building above every other building in the tiers of Government which are represented in the capital city of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was also recognised by the previous administration that where, in its judgment, a State was able to provide the financial resources to overcome these <span class="highlight">natural</span> problems which arose, it should do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it not <span class="highlight">natural</span> that any Minister overseas, if he saw fit to contact his own Prime Minister, would be at liberty to do so? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask this in the light of the fact that  Senator Wriedt  forwarded a letter to the  Chairman  of the Estimates Committee,  Senator Primmer,  in which he indicated that it would be only <span class="highlight">natural</span>, having regard to the attitude of the Opposition in this place, that the Minister would be looking at ways other than by passing legislation through the Senate to have the organisation established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, given the attitude of the Opposition parties to many important Government legislative initiatives it is only <span class="highlight">natural</span> that  Dr Cairns  and the Attorney-General,  Senator Murphy,  would study alternatives to the passage of legislation through Parliament should this contingency be required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Likewise overlooked, or deliberately left out, is the axiomatic and traditional regard for the <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Law, the impregnable rock of civilisation, i.e., marriage, as and being, the basis of human society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-1-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not want to weary the Senate by reading any very long extracts from a document which already is public information but I would like to say that if one refers to statement F it states, in response to information sought by  Senator Baume,  that $100,000 is the estimated expenditure for the Australian Assistance Plan publicity and that $35,000 has been set aside for <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources material and $65,000 for promotion on a regional basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will include matters which concern not only unique geographical features, unique <span class="highlight">natural</span> and botanical features of this country but also the preservation of historical buildings which are important to future generations of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the point remains that in 23 years of government the Liberal Party did nothing about this very important question of preserving unique historical and <span class="highlight">natural</span> features in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite <span class="highlight">natural</span> for people to question whether we should be paying millions of dollars for paintings for the national art collection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What contribution to that level has been made by (a) <span class="highlight">natural</span> radiation and (b) nuclear testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-45-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We find the industry repugnant, unnecessary, and benefits but a few people in this country, whereas live kangaroos in their <span class="highlight">natural</span> habitat, through their value as tourist attractions are economically far more profitable to our economy and to us aesthetically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Has the Minister representing the Minister for Minerals and Energy seen claims that the supply of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas to Perth could be inadequate by 1980? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer also to the exploitation of the very large reserves of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas which already have been proven at very great expense by the companies that have been drilling on the north-west shelf for some years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another aspect of this problem of the attitude expressed by the Minister for Minerals and Energy, which I believe is the cause of the trouble, concerns the supply of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas to the metropolitan area of Perth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, on the north west shelf large reserves of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas have been proven. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The stalemate is so serious that there is undoubtedly a real threat to the supply of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas to the metropolitan area of Perth from at least 1980 onwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although there may be supplies for a longer period for domestic consumption in Perth because of the resources at Dongara which supply Perth with gas, nevertheless there is already a great demand by industrial users in Perth for <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas which cannot be met from the Dongara field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So already there is a demand for <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas which cannot be satisfied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That demand will grow and by the 1980s there will be a very serious shortage of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas for Perth, apart altogether from the rest of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only one person is responsible for the threat to Perth’s supplies of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas- that is, the Minister for Minerals and Energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The floods of January 1974 created an urgent situation by damaging some levee banks and greatly eroding an existing <span class="highlight">natural</span> floodwater  Break-out ‘, with the result that flooding caused considerable damage to property and crops. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the need to give the widest possible protection and assistance to the family as the <span class="highlight">natural</span> and fundamental group unit of society, particularly while it is responsible for the care and education of dependent children: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to paragraph (b), the Committee will recall that those words ‘the <span class="highlight">natural</span> and fundamental group unit of society’ are the ones which appear in the Convention on Civil and Political Rights and also in the Universal Declaration of Rights, and I am sure that their inclusion in this Bill will receive a certain amount of approval throughout the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is said now, although it was not said originally, that the project will result in a wastage of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts simply are that the amount of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas which would be used over the next 20 to 25 years until the turn of the century would represent about 10 per cent of the available known <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas resources at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite unreasonable whatever might be the theoretical arguments to say that there would be a diminution of the supplies of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas to other persons who would be using it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I share the view expressed by the Minister for Transport that out <span class="highlight">natural</span> highways should be utilised to the maximum extent practicable and would not therefore wish to see Sydney’s ferry services wither away; as has happened to so many public transport services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been the history of the States that they tend to look after themselves which is, I suppose, a fairly <span class="highlight">natural</span> reaction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Admittedly, the old export payments insurance scheme- the insurance of extended type of payment or the guarantee for extended terms of payment- has been of great assistance to Australian exporters over the years, and what is provided by this Bill is simply a <span class="highlight">natural</span> but very important development of that type of assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel that we desire people who are resident in Australia and who are desirous of becoming employed in our Public Service to become naturalised citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a provision in the legislation, to which there has already been reference, under which persons who are not naturalised and who are migrants can become members of the Public Service provided that, in the opinion of the Governor-General, there is no detriment to the national security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accepting that there is that gateway that will enable exceptional cases to be covered, why should not the general proposition be that the Public Service is open to <span class="highlight">natural</span> born or naturalised Australian citizens, people who are prepared to take the oath of allegiance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my second reading speech on the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Bill I drew the attention of honourable senators to world-wide concern for the conservation of wildlife and of places of <span class="highlight">natural</span>, scenic, scientific and recreational significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all share a responsibility to conserve for future generations as much of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> heritage as possible- in terms of both area and diversity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It enables the National Government- for the first time- to make a major financial commitment so that future generations will have the chance to see, understand and enjoy the special <span class="highlight">natural</span> qualities of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, I regard this Bill as a very significant part of this Government’s response to the growing public awareness of our precious but dwindling <span class="highlight">natural</span> heritage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone will accept that a normal measure of risk taking is the proper and <span class="highlight">natural</span> province of a free enterprise society, but I am sure that everyone will agree that the sort of inflationary risk taking with which the Australian economy is faced today is most definitely incapable of being solved by the best managerial skills here or anywhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will be aware of worldwide concern for the conservation of wildlife and of places of <span class="highlight">natural</span>, scenic, scientific and recreational significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Everywhere the <span class="highlight">natural</span> systems which evolved with man and of which he is part are under threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over 100 nations have taken action for the permanent reservation of <span class="highlight">natural</span> areas to represent the range of landscapes and ecosystems within their boundaries, and to protect their unique wildlife resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In commending this Bill to honourable senators, I would like to stress that it is high time that this Parliament enacted legislation on behalf of all Australians to permit the Australian Government to play its proper part in the conservation of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> heritage, which indeed is part of a world heritage becoming increasingly precious to mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion I would like to say that this action accords with the sentiments of the Labor Party platform where it is recognised that ‘ man lives within and depends upon a complex <span class="highlight">natural</span> system which must be protected and managed as a whole ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advance of agricultural pursuits and the expansion of cities and their industries have been the cause of much of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> habitat of Australia’s native flora and fauna being severely reduced and in some cases lost completely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">natural</span> heritage should be fostered and our <span class="highlight">natural</span> landscapes protected for the sake of social, cultural, educational and scientific purposes as well as for Australia ‘s future tourist potential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government is seeking to protect those <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources upon which the nation’s well being is founded, in the interests of present and future generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the completion of this essential first program, the Government will then assess its responsibilities in the implementation of a national plan to protect and restore Australia’s soil resources- which is perhaps, along with water, the most vital of all our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge that in a world in which we are in peril in this coming year of some 30 million people dying of starvation and disease it is imperative for Australia to look to the whole of its <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and to put them to work not just for the lucky 13 million people of Australia but to help to provide for and to feed those who are less privileged than we. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The House of Representatives Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation recommended that grants be provided to the States to enable them to acquire areas of wildlife habitat which are of <span class="highlight">natural</span> significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How good it is that in the space of some 9 years in my State of New South Wales the areas of <span class="highlight">natural</span> parks have substantially more than doubled: They have increased far more than that because some 2 million acres that were in existence before the Askin Government came to office were taken up almost entirely by the Kosciusko National Park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will also provide watershed protection, a near-perfect wildlife habitat, and an unmatched science laboratory where we can measure the world in its <span class="highlight">natural</span> balance against the world in its manmade imbalance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If that is the case then, of course, a problem arises in relation to all those rights and licences and permits to explore for and to develop oil or <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas which have been acquired by various companies under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I probably do not need to reiterate to honourable senators that this is the well known offshore legislation, the exercise of cooperation between the Commonwealth Government and all States to enable the drilling for oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas around the off-shore areas of Australia on the continental shelf off the Australian continent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is worse when one realises that, to my knowledge, no attempt has been made to impose any statutory obligation on private individuals and companies which in my view are indulging, together with State governments, in the rape and spoliation of part of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resource heritage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We see, as we did not see earlier, despoliation of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> environment inways which were quite perceptibly occurring but the import of which was never sufficiently appreciated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that  Mr Barnard,  the Minister for Defence, who is responsible for the <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Disasters Organisation, expressed very great concern about the possibility of this happening again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee was subjected to a large range of different sounds, electronic and <span class="highlight">natural</span>, that were frightening to hear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The document also emphasises the value of the private sector in the economy and how it is the private sector- individuals and companies, as the document states- that can best develop our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and employ our work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The disaster is the worst <span class="highlight">natural</span> calamity in Australia’s history and this Bill covers measures necessary both to restore Darwin and to provide for the future safety of people and property of that city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The local civil defence organisation was the only organisation that was partly geared to cover a <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster of this type in those days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The organisation had never been given a great deal of information and instruction on how to handle a <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But within a matter of hours after the Darwin cyclone the Australian Government put its <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Disasters Organisation into operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we were in Opposition we tried time and time again, by urgency motions and other motions in this chamber, to get some sort of a <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster organisation off the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Major-General Stretton, who was appointed as head of the <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Disasters Organisation by this Government, did a tremendous job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On that occasion the <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Disasters Organisation had its first trial of strength. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The damage that has been caused in this and other <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters in this country in the last few years ought not to be dealt with as a political issue and this Government has not done so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that in those circumstances we are able to draw the conclusion that about every 30 or 40 years through <span class="highlight">natural</span> causes Darwin will be faced with problems of the sort caused by the calamity that hit on Christmas Day last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we are concerned about is that these <span class="highlight">natural</span> assets on the Australian continent and off-shore within the area described by international law should belong to the Australian people and that they ought to enjoy the benefits of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a question of whether the Australian community should derive benefits from the <span class="highlight">natural</span> wealth of this country which is deposited both on the land and on the continental shelf and its surrounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They include exploration for minerals and the carrying on of operations, the execution of works, the recovery of minerals and the carrying on of operations and the execution of works for that purpose, the conservation and protection of, and the prevention of the waste of, the <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of the offshore zone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has requested that a team of trained officers be sent with the initial task force to areas devastated by <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we had said to the senator who has left this chamber and who was endeavouring to reform society as far as companies are concerned ‘There will not be any mergers of any companies’, what a howl there would have been; we would have been told that we were trespassing on the <span class="highlight">natural</span> rights of private enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Reading from the Bill, the Corporation will have the function of facilitating and encouraging the establishment, development and advancement of Australian industries concerned with the manufacture, processing, treatment, transportation or distribution of goods or the development or use of <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources, including the recovery of minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it had been backed by the AIDC and by the NIF as originally envisaged by the Government I doubt whether there would be a place anywhere for any private company or for people in this country to own or operate any of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If that is to be said to be the way in which we are to fund the exploration for and exploitation of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and /or to assist our own secondary industries and rural industries, why should that sort of technique and that philosophy not be employed through the representatives of the Australian people as elected by the Australian people and not through the board of directors of company A or company B? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From the way in which I followed his argument it seemed to me that on the one hand he was trying to say that Australians should have an interest in their own economy, <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and secondary industry and that on the other he talked about the importance of overseas finance and foreign investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The unexpected appearance in your columns ( 1 November) of the views of the ‘Modest Member’ on the Refrigeration and Compressors Bounty Bill now before the Senate obliges me to break a silence self-imposed as a courtesy <span class="highlight">natural</span> to an issue of industrial and political seriousness under discussion with the Government in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that on world tests Australia because of its grasslands, both <span class="highlight">natural</span> and improved, and because of the management capacity of its operators and breeders has demonstrated that it can produce cattle extremely well, very cheaply and very efficiently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Disasters Organisation and the Defence Force, the Departments of the Northern Territory, Housing and Construction, Social Security, Manufacturing Industry, and elements of other departments all contributed to the relief operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the plea to the Australian Government that it ought to take the opportunity afforded by the occurrence of a number of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters to evaluate the emotional effects upon people of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters of the magnitude that regrettably are becoming more frequent in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Five <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters are referred to in the legislation, namely the disasters in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland and, we can add to that, Tasmania and Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I suggest to the Senate- I propose to follow it up with the Minister for Health  (Dr Everingham)-  that the National Hospitals and Health Services Commission commission a study of the emotional morbidity which is the sequel of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters of the severity and the scale that Australians in Darwin and southern Tasmania have unfortunately experienced in recent months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Government will take this opportunity, through the Health and Hospitals Commission, to have a broad national analysis to determine the extent of medical-social pathology consequent upon <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fourth matter that I think could well be considered in this national survey which 1 suggest is whether the role of the <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Disasters Organisation should be enlarged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one already exists I would not believe that it has been in sufficient depth to afford a guide to this nation as to how continuing <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters, which I regret have to be expected, can be most adequately dealt with in the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the Defence Services are called upon to provide a wide range of emergency relief equipment from their own stores in times of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly we need to seek no further in relation to the area of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that those are the <span class="highlight">natural</span> effects of government interference in almost any business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The truth of the matter is that the Opposition has been caught between its own high flown rhetoric in favour of this legislation and its <span class="highlight">natural</span> inclinations which are against it and the belated concern on the other hand of its State government colleages who have suddenly discovered that they are concerned about this legislation in the interests of their own particular governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it seems perfectly <span class="highlight">natural</span> and, to my mind, quite obvious that, when the Senate is confronted with a Bill of this type, with its size and complexity, the proper and efficient way of dealing with it, both in the interests of the Bill itself and of the Senate’s proceedings in dealing with other business and legislation, is that it should be sent off to a special committee or a standing committee to give it the type of close consideration that it must receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until in the last few years  Mr Justice  Windeyer adverted to the limitations- shall I say- of that doctrine and the possibility that there should be more flexibility in ascribing to the persons who promote a juristic corporation agency for the principal <span class="highlight">natural</span> persons we had that doctrine very arbitrarily applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be able to engage in specialist work such as, to give some examples, the operating criteria of multinational corporations or an examination of developmental projects involving the use of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I certainly believe that if an Inter-State Commission had been in existence at the time when petroleum and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas were discovered in Australia it could have performed- it would have performed, because it would have been empowered to do so- the function of establishing a means by which a network of pipelines throughout Australia could have ensured at reasonable rates, or at least assessed rates, the distribution of crude oil and gas right around Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the essential principles are set out in clause 4 of the Bill where the National Estate is defined as follows:   the national estate consists of those places, being components of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> environment of Australia or the cultural environment of Australia, that have aesthetic, historic, scientific or social significance or other special value for future generations as well as for the present community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The three components of the cultural and <span class="highlight">natural</span> environment forming the National Estate are those which are: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that definition the Committee also pointed out that these things fall into many categories, some of them matters of <span class="highlight">natural</span> environment, some of them man-made and part of our cultural environment, others archeological and others cultural. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:  (1)1 am not aware of any large scale surveys into the <span class="highlight">natural</span> levels of mercury and mercurials in the total Australian environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The major part of the island tended to be a national park in the form of a sanctuary for Australian wildlife in its <span class="highlight">natural</span> setting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The New South Wales Planning and Environment Commission has apparently recommended to the Minister for Lands and Forests that the island remain in its <span class="highlight">natural</span> state, with the small north-eastern tip of the island to be developed as a fishing port. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Tweed Shire Council has advised that the most recent plan for the development of the island proposes that about half remain in its <span class="highlight">natural</span> state as a nature reserve, with the remainder of the island to be used for a number of purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There happens to be a nonparty prejudice on the part of those people who for so long have endeavoured to stimulate the Queensland Government into doing something which would allow the Reef to combat and protect itself against many threats, both <span class="highlight">natural</span> and man-made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When more modern methods of transportation are available- of course, that can be very costlypeople will realise what a wonderful place it is and more people will go to see the Great Barrier Reef, which, so far as I am concerned, is the greatest <span class="highlight">natural</span> masterpiece in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Queensland Government is conscious of the need to look after this very great <span class="highlight">natural</span> attraction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from the completion of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas pipeline from Cooper Basin-Palm Valley-Dampier-Perth, provision was made for the 84 miles submarine pipeline from Dampier to the North Rankin production platform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Provision was made for participation in the necessary petrochemical plant at Dampier, to extract the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas liquids for conversion into motor spirit and other derivatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The cost of three uranium mining and milling plants in the Northern Territory and assistance to the Cooper Basin <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas consortium, in which the Australian Government is now a partner, was included and also the cost of the plans to economise in diesel fuel consumption, by electrification of the heavy freight rail areas in New South Wales and Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are determined to exploit Western Australia’s enormous <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas potential- the North- West Shelf- rather than selling off its vital part of Australia ‘s farm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order to tap the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas resources in South Australia, New South Wales and Western Australia, we have under consideration proposals costing over $400m for pipelines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 was the one who discovered  Mr Karidis  and if it had not been for me finding  Mr Karidis  the Government would never have got near the point of being able to raise enough money to give Australia ownership of its own <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We agreed with a very prominent member of the Government of the day,  Mr Jack  McEwen, who was the Leader of the Australian Country Party at the time and who is on record as criticising the Liberal Government of the day for selling the farm and for giving away Australia’s <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As  Mr Connor  pointed out, the estimated value of those <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources is not just $4 billion, it is $5,700 billion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition parties would let overseas interests come in and take control of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources as they have done down the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First, he mentioned the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas pipeline from Cooper Basin, Palm Valley, Dampier to Perth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, there was the petrochemical plant at Dampier to extract the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas liquids for conversion into motor spirit and other derivatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The term ‘<span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster’ is not mentioned in the Bill in any consequential form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Opposition hold the view that the area of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster calls for treatment, and I shall deal with that shortly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It demonstrated the need for a <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters relief authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The functions would include the administration of financial disaster relief, the prescription of measures for minimisation of risk exposure to disasters and the co-ordination of the activities of various government and private agencies in the mitigation of the effects of <span class="highlight">natural</span> and other disasters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the attitude of the Opposition in opposing this measure denies the public the benefits of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster insurance which private insurers for obvious reasons are unable to provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately this nation has experienced in recent years a number of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters, in particular the Queensland floods and the Darwin cyclone, in relation to which, if it had not been for the beneficient attitude of this Government, many people would have experienced personal financial disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides for national disasters and <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters, which are not provided for and are not likely to be provided for under current commercial practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the disaster of this Government, the insurance companies have sustained heavy claims due to <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters in the last couple of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Wright  would just listen for a moment, instead of giving vent to such expressions and grunting away about superphosphate or <span class="highlight">natural</span> manure or whatever he is talking about, he would hear what the Green Paper on Rural Policy in Australia states. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The one exception is that there is a job to be done with regard to <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proper that the Government should come forward, and come forward soon, with a plan for the proper financing of insurance cover for <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters and it is quite competent for it to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also is aimed at providing insurance for non-commercial risks such as <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters and crop and stock losses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster insurance in this country is in a very poor state, and people of Darwin, Brisbane and other places who have suffered unfortunate disasters all can testify to that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a piece of hypocrisy for the Government to put forward as a mainstay of the Bill that the Corporation might be directed by the Minister to engage in <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster insurance even though it was not on commercially sound principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we will persevere when we go into government with the industry’s idea, and I have no doubt that there will be a better <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster scheme, based upon proposals nationwide from the industry co-operating together, than anything we could get from a public enterprise with a performance such as that of the Australian Post Office or the Australian National Line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, Federal Executive calls on the Australian Government and the insurance industry to urgently examine ways of protecting the Australian people against loss arising from catastrophe and <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has placed great store on the question of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters, and I must say that that question gives me some concern, too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know in his heart the Minister agrees with me, that this is good business to attract money from overseas to pay our own <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were good political tactics employed by the Liberal Party, and they were consistent with its general disinterest in the development of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and the sorts of policies that it followed for 23 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that state of knowledge, with his suspicion of what would be attempted, it would be <span class="highlight">natural</span> for the Minister to satisfy himself that no secret deal was being engaged in or that he was not being misinformed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, put the two together with the <span class="highlight">natural</span> reflation which will come with that action and we will have inflation which will top 20 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first group to which I shall refer are those amendments which deal with vessels and other structures engaged in the off-shore industry, in activities associated with exploring or exploiting the <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of the continental shelf of Australia, or the seabed of the Australian coastal sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to refer to one other very important service that has come to our attention, namely, the <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Disasters Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That whereas the <span class="highlight">natural</span> environment of Fraser Island is so outstanding that it should be identified as part of the World <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Heritage, and whereas the Island should be conserved for the enjoyment of this and future generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently there has been a rundown because of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> factors and not because of government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the <span class="highlight">natural</span> sanction that if a government is good, if a government is stable and if a government has not sustained unpopularity there will be no such instability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even in Western Australia, where we have our own <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster in  Sir Charles  Court as Premier, it has never been envisaged that an upper House had the power to refuse Supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is not the <span class="highlight">natural</span> circumstance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believed that in this country there were <span class="highlight">natural</span> advantages to those who opposed our side of the House- advantages of money, of media control and of influence- but we thought that they were at least balanced by the parliamentary system which we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was a <span class="highlight">natural</span> thing for me immediately when approached first on the matter and before receiving any documentation specifically to raise the point that it was this same crude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Firstly, let us deal with the case of Ivan Pavlovic, a naturalised Australian citizen of Croatian origin who wishes to obtain an Australian passport to travel to Yugoslavia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us dispose for all time of  Senator Greenwood’s  extravagant proposition that this is a <span class="highlight">natural</span> right of any Australian citizen which has been adhered to by all Australian governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Srecko Rover, a naturalised Australian, would appear to have had all of the rights of  Mr Ivan  Pavlovic, but for reasons which it never saw fit to publicise the McMahon Government refused him an Australian passport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators will know, the Government has been most concerned with the effects of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a number of important initiatives, including the setting up of the <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Disasters Organisation and the high level coordination of the defence forces in these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as a <span class="highlight">natural</span> courtesy to you I seek leave to continue my remarks because we want to say more about this report and about the Commission at a later date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Khemlani  has not been able to do more than present documents which are documents which have been passed legitimately between himself and Ministers of the Crown in respect of the Government’s overall objectives of obtaining funds so that we may purchase equity in the <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to you,  Mr Deputy President,  that a considerable number of references have been made to me over the last 10 minutes and it seemed to me to be most <span class="highlight">natural</span> that I should rise immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That whereas the <span class="highlight">natural</span> environment of Fraser Island is so outstanding that it should be identified as pan of the world <span class="highlight">natural</span> heritage, and whereas the Island should be conserved for the enjoyment of this and future generations, your petitioners humbly pray that the members, in Parliament assembled, will take the most urgent steps to ensure: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-0-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Australian Government uses its constitutional authority to assist the Queensland Government and any other properly constituted body to develop and conserve the recreational, educational and scientific potentials of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> environment of Fraser Island for the long term benefit of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-0-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I indicated in the Parliament, it is Government policy to allow greater use of the Defence Force in <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consideration is therefore being given to amending current legislation to allow greater use of reserves for <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters and civil emergencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the actual requirement to utilise reserve units will naturally be dependent on the adequacy of the other means available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister whether he will make investigations into this matter to see what action can be taken to ensure that these skulls of Aboriginal people are returned to their <span class="highlight">natural</span> burial grounds and are not displayed for the amusement of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is abundant evidence in all the reports- the Jackson Committee report, the Industries Assistance Commission reports and the AIDA comments- which have been consistently before governments over the last seven or eight years to indicate that there has been a <span class="highlight">natural</span> decline in private sector activity in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The DPRK Foreign Minister said that it was <span class="highlight">natural</span> that there should be ‘serious differences’ between us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751111_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, in fact, the development of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources can be expedited by a greater degree of consultation with the States, I would think that course ought to be followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751111_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That whereas the <span class="highlight">natural</span> environment of Fraser Island is so outstanding that it should be identified as part of the World <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Heritage, and whereas the Island should be conserved for the enjoyment of this and future generations, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>that the Australian Government uses its constitutional authority to assist the Queensland Government and any other properly constituted body to develop and conserve the recreational, educational and scientific potentials of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> environment of Fraser Island for the long term benefit of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can understand the honourable senator’s <span class="highlight">natural</span> anxiety neurosis on these matters because he has little otherwise to cling to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 9 February the Prime Minister stated that departments and authorities were expected to reach their revised staff ceilings by processes of <span class="highlight">natural</span> wastage, such as retirements and resignations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is evident if one looks at the prospects of economic stability to be obtained from the <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources in Australia, many of which are contained in the soils of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The chances of success in the production of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas, oil and minerals are excellent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>McArthur River and copper and gold at Tennant Creek and other areas, place the Northern Territory in an extremely enviable position at the top of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources ladder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us take <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas for a start. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Admittedly we are not in the throes of a world war as we were then, but with anxiety increasing in the East Timor area, which is but a short hop across the water, it is only <span class="highlight">natural</span> that a feeling of apprehension is evident in the minds of those who are most vulnerable, that is, the people of the north. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps some <span class="highlight">natural</span> distrust arises from the fact that a government department should be involving itself in advising businesses about anything, and I guess that is well understood by the business community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pause only to draw the picture of the island State of Tasmania which pays almost every penalty for federation such as having to pay high tariffs because we protect the industries of Melbourne and Sydney with everything we buy and having to have every industry which uses its <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and its labour resources - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That time was around Christmas, when because of their own <span class="highlight">natural</span> attitudes and habits people were contributing to the inflationary spiral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in this country have been sitting on reserves in our north-west shelf amounting to trillions of cubic feet of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Western Australia would like that <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An export demand exists for <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In South Australia we have vast resources of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I should explain to the honourable senator that questions on flood relief and financial assistance arising from <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters might be appropriately addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate or to the Minister representing the Treasurer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government as one of its initiatives during its 3 years in office set out to fund historical museums to try to retain some of the past history of this country which could be lost for all time due to <span class="highlight">natural</span> causes and the neglect of mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is entitled, therefore, to raise very sharply whether there is any relationship, when Australia is regarded as a treasure house in terms of its mineral resources, <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and all the other resources that we have in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not outside the realms of possibility that there are people who were concerned about the development of the democratic tendencies within Australia and about the feelings that existed within our country for Australians to run their own affairs and for Australians to own the great <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources in respect of which many people such as  Sir Philip  Baxter, have already expressed very strong views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One therefore is entitled to look a little more closely at the events which cut off in one swoop the attempts that were being made by a decent Australian Government to try to maintain Australian equity in our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This approach was based on the adoption of a 10-year conversion period so that individual sectors might plan their own conversion programs in such a way as to minimise any conversion costs by taking maximum advantage of <span class="highlight">natural</span> obsolesence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agriculture and the livestock have done much to enhance the <span class="highlight">natural</span> beauty of the island, and in many fields Tasmania’s agriculture has led Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such an expansion would be wonderful for Tasmania in the utilisation of human, <span class="highlight">natural</span> and existing transport and business resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of many kinds would be the envy of many people from overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we really want to make people second class citizens we can do no better than to deny them what the majority of the people of Australia not only take for granted but also look on as their <span class="highlight">natural</span> right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators can understand the kinds of things that happen to our roads and bridges during these times of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage it is apparent that a reduction of this size cannot be expected to come from <span class="highlight">natural</span> wastage alone particularly as there are virtually no other job opportunities in the Woomera area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a just and <span class="highlight">natural</span> irritation which had been building up in me while  Senator Douglas  McClelland was speaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Based on preliminary estimates of production quality of Gippsland crude, which includes liquids (other than LPG and ethane) produced in association with <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas, the formula might result in a quality differential some what higher than for Moonie, but the actual quality and therefore differential can only be determined after production testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On11 December 1975 the Premier of Western Australia wrote to the Prime Minister seeking Commonwealth support under the present <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster assistance arrangements for the provision of a range of measures for relief and restoration purposes following the severe damage caused to Port Hedland by Cyclone Joan on 8 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-68-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This amount relates to the State’s base expenditure amount which, under present <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster relief arrangements, is to be paid by the State out of its own resources on agreed relief and restoration measures, with expenditures beyond that for these purposes being borne by the Commonwealth in any one financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-68-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the decision that, in the case of custody of children, the Act was valid only to the extent that it applied to proceedings between the parties to a marriage for the custody of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> or adopted children of both of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The expression child of a marriage has been limited to the <span class="highlight">natural</span> or adopted children of both parties to the marriage, although the existing, wider meaning has been retained for the purposes of section 63- which prevents a divorce becoming absolute unless the court is satisfied as to the welfare of children of the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is this Government’s policy to encourage exploration for and development of more gas reserves by allowing the limited export of liquefied <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-69-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While the Labor Government continued to supply to Japan, and our other major trading partners, whatever liquefied petroleum gas we could reasonably export, it was committed to the view that all <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas produced from the North West Shelf would be purchased at the wellhead by the Pipeline Authority and any exports of LNG would thus become its responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-69-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Would foreign aid be far more beneficial if small solar energy stations or packs were built to enable small communities to conserve fuel and other <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources; if so, will the Government initiate the research required for the development and production of such solar energy power units by immediately providing funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The total inferred raw gas reserves in Australia have recently been suggested by the Bureau of Mineral Resources to be between 1700 and 2500 billion cubic metres (reported in a paper entitled ‘Australia’s <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Gas Reserves and Future <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Gas Potential’ by L.

    <p>My reason for speaking on the adjournment debate tonight is to raise the serious problems which face people living in the electorates of Macquarie and Calare in New South Wales because of this Government’s decision concerning growth centres and decentralisation and because of the long delay in construction of the lateral gas pipelines to bring <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas to these areas as part of the national pipeline grid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas laterals is also directly linked to that of decentralisation and development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer, firstly, to the matter of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas is a clean form of fuel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is economical and it is preferable to most other forms of fuel for these reasons: Industry in the areas of Lithgow and Bathurst-Orange, including decentralised industries, are eagerly awaiting <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas supplies to fulfil their fuel and energy requests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That now seems a remote possibility and unless the Government rethinks its position the people of Lithgow and Bathurst-Orange will not have <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas this decade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am happy to inform the Senate that all the reports which I have read or heard in the media suggesting a 50 per cent cutback in migrant education are based on a complete but <span class="highlight">natural</span> misunderstanding of the Budget papers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and refers to the concern expressed last week by  Senator Sibraa  in relation to the failure to construct laterals from the <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas pipeline to Lithgow, Orange and Bathurst in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Connor,  however, allowed the laterals to be constructed at a suitable time, which in real measure abandoned the chances of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas being supplied to the aforementioned country centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is of no use everybody being terribly pious and talking about the role of Senate committees, about the need to have a Senate committee as a watchdog of the people’s rights and liberties- as the Regulations and Ordinances Committee is often referred to- with the necessity to have parliamentary intervention against the always <span class="highlight">natural</span> desire of the Executive to bypass the normal, standard procedures of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Hence there is a need for the Government again to give incentives to an industry which can make such a contribution in looking for <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources in Australia and in turn create so much revenue for this country and a position of independence in this important resource. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government removed the restriction on the sale of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas abroad, thus prejudicing Australia’s future supplies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every effort has to be made, however, to work in greater co-operation in matters such as machinery sharing, experimentation, better extension services, concentration on improving quality, and the best use of <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources, climates and conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of its <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and geographical location, Australia is fundamentally a trading nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In these circumstances, with Australian jobs in the motor vehicle industry disappearing- but I emphasis above all the loss of work in the basic industry of steel making in which we used to produce the best and the cheapest in the world because of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> advantages of having an abundance of coal and iron ore resources in Australiaand the loss of jobs in other basic industries, do honourable senators opposite still maintain that we should spend more? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>First, in relation to the Continental Shelf (Living <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Resources) Act, the Bill places the statutory powers conferred by the Act in the hands of the Minister for Primary Industry and the Secretary to his Department, rather than in that Minister and the Minister having responsibility for external Territories, as in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While I certainly have no quarrel with our immigration program I believe that in these days when we are nearing zero growth and when our population is nothing more than static, the <span class="highlight">natural</span> Australian family must be encouraged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is <span class="highlight">natural</span>, in correcting this situation, that we should ensure that the Aboriginal people get value for their money and that the money that has been allocated by the Government gets to the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps an additional point worth emphasising is that, if the Inquiry were to recommend mining at Ranger, we would consider that action should be deferred until the area was examined with regard to its suitability for acceptance as part of the World Heritage under the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Heritage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A critical complication is caused by sewerage seeping to the <span class="highlight">natural</span> water contained in the swamp, posing a continual health risk to the community, particularly to adventurous children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will recall that whilst the Government might have felt a bit miffed- that is a <span class="highlight">natural</span> human reaction- there has not been, nor could there have been, any disciplinary action taken against those colleagues either by the parliamentary Party or by their Party organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed this action is probably a combination of <span class="highlight">natural</span> politeness, and their attitude to someone in authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has since removed the restriction on the sale of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas overseas, thus selling out our national resources, or, as the saying goes, giving them away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the Labor Government’s administration the IAC was obliged to have regard to the desire of the Government- a Labor Government was in power when this legislation was pursued in Parliament in 1973- in pursuing the general objectives of national economic and social policy and urban and regional development, to improve and promote the well-being of the people of Australia, with full employment, stability in the general level of prices, viability in external economic relations, conservation of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> environment and rising living standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether the resources be labour, capital or <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources, the employment of resources within the rural sector is rapidly declining because of the disincentive approach of the Labor Government towards the rural sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think one of the problems I encountered on Christmas Island- it was a <span class="highlight">natural</span> difficulty which the people had- was that I was the fifth Minister to arrive in just over 3 years who said: ‘Yes, the resettlement program is about to commence’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite all the allegations that Labor had done nothing for agriculture and the assertions that the position of agriculture would change dramatically once the <span class="highlight">natural</span> rulers of this country were back in their proper place, we find in fact that there is a net payment of $25m to revenue in the estimates for this year from the agricultural sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The aim of decentralisation, if it is to be truly achieved, is to establish areas to which people want to go, spontaneously, and to which, because of the environmental circumstances and the <span class="highlight">natural</span> attributes of the area, people have a <span class="highlight">natural</span> desire to go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In summary the policy provides for cyclists and pedestrians, efficient local bus services, development of an express intertown public transport system, discouraging the use of private cars for commuting, a parking policy to reinforce these provisions, and the development of a road network which provides a good level of service for freight and off peak car usage, and protects the <span class="highlight">natural</span> and social environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-88-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are two aspects to this matter: contents of warnings issued by the Bureau and disseminated via the media and other channels; material issued by <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Disasters Orgaisation, State Emergency Services and the Bureau to educate the public with respect to cyclones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-89-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to assure the honourable senator that the Bureau of Meteorology, in conjunction with the <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Disasters Organisation and the State Emergency Services, makes continual reassessment of the effectiveness of the warning system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-89-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These impediments include the immobility of some rural capital, imperfections in the capital market, the limited off-farm occupational opportunities in rural areas and a <span class="highlight">natural</span> reluctance and often inability for farmers to relocate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are prepared to give legislative support to a concerted effort which, we feel, should be made now to establish the necessary administrative machinery at the national level to cope with the continued need that will exist for rural adjustment measures as a <span class="highlight">natural</span> consequence of this Government’s ill-conceived economic policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 30 November  Senator Bonner  asked me as Minister representing the Minister for National Resources whether I was aware that the Iranian Government had recently cancelled a SUS5.6 billion project to export liquefied gas to the United States and Europe, the American company named being the El Paso <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Gas Company and if so, whether the feasibility had been explored of further developing our country’s reputed vast reserves of this commodity on a viable basis so as to capture part of the lucrative overseas market in the United States and selected European nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our second objective, of course, was to ensure that financial resources were available to develop our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources throughout the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have 66.82 1 million cubic metres of liquid <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and 410.1 129 billion cubic metres of gas of which only a maximum of 70 per cent can be recovered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia has very large reserves of coal and uranium but we are relatively depleted in oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main advantage is of course that it has <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas close by on the North West Shelf which can be supplied very cheaply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other area with which the White Paper has failed to deal adequately is the South Pacific, the region in which Australia is strong in <span class="highlight">natural</span> geographic interests along with New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consequently I suggest that the obvious and <span class="highlight">natural</span> need for defence in the foreseeable future of this land must lie in a top priority being given to maritime and air strength strike and reconnaissance capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, there is another criterion which should be applied to the question of who should be appointed to senior positions in the Public Service, and that is whether the appointees are people who, as a result of many years of service in the Australian Public Service and many years of residence in this sociological wasteland of Canberra, have assumed a <span class="highlight">natural</span> conservatism in all their decision making, or whether they are not victims of that process of hardening of the bureaucratic arteries which arises from long term service and long term residence in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I observe that a lot of the forecasts about Australia’s glowing and brilliant future in the 1980s will fall to the ground if we do not do something more about finding more oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any high school economics student who failed to grasp the significance of being at the end of long transport routes and who failed to grasp the significance of what economists call <span class="highlight">natural</span> protection and to realise that, other things being equal, import competing industries which are at the end or which provide a market at the end of long transport routes require not more but less protection, would richly deserve to fail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The entire strategy of the Fraser Government has been directed not at trying to overcome the problems of unemployment in our country but at trying to turn the clock back and trying to improve the lot of a very small number of powerful overseas companies to make it easier for them to exploit and develop our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the absence of specific legislation governing compensation payments, and having regard to the fact that similar payments have not been made to the victims of other <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters, it has been decided that the payments made in respect of the period of special difficulty that immediately followed the cyclone, and the period of adjustment that has subsequently occurred, are not to continue beyond 3 1 March 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we try to do in the White Paper is to say what will be the broad shape of the economy, how its employment characteristics will move, how we will look to maximise the opportunities of the people of Australia, what the best way is to look after those people and to help them to do the best possible job for themselves and their country, what should be our balance of trade position and the balance of local opportunity, how we should best add value to the <span class="highlight">natural</span> raw materials we find or grow them in the ground, and how to maximise the opportunities for the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In terms of the future growth of manufacturing industry, Australia’s endowment in capital, labour, skills, <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources and market opportunities would seem to indicate that the best prospects for manufacturing industry development in Australia in the long term lie in activities which are based on Australia’s <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources, which are innovative in terms of skill or design, which meet specialised local needs, or which have a high degree of <span class="highlight">natural</span> protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and relates to the economics of the proposed <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas pipeline from the North West Shelf to the eastern seaboard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware also that the United States Federal Power Commission has recommended that a planned pipeline to carry <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas from Alaska’s north slope be built across Canada and that the Commission’s economic study indicated that the cost per thousand cubic feet delivered to Chicago would be 80c? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This turn-off is far less than the <span class="highlight">natural</span> increase, and the district is thought to have a cattle population excess of about 100 000 head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, overall, there is a rapidly increasing cattle population where the <span class="highlight">natural</span> increase far exceeds the turn-off to the various States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is a fair comparison and if Australia’s future depends on it being free of brucellosis and tuberculosis by 1984, the fact that the cattle populations of the Northern Territory are out of control for various reasons- the excess of <span class="highlight">natural</span> increase over turn-off; the fact that the cattle stations in the Northern Territory at present, at least, are not viable economically in many instances; costs are defeating the operator; he is not in a position to control his herds properly; and mustering is allowed to slip by- means that this eradication program must break down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the continuing poor economic conditions of the Northern Territory pastoral industry, the fact that it is not economic to transport beef, in some circumstances, to market and the fact that because the <span class="highlight">natural</span> increase of beef numbers is far outstripping annual turnoff, the cattle population has increased by some 680 000 head since 1972, will the Government give consideration to the reintroduction of the freight subsidy for Northern Territory beef? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware of a statement attributed to the Acting General Manager of the Australian Gas Light Co.,  Mr M.  J.

    <p>Completion of the rehousing and reconstruction program awaits the finalising of negotiations between the Queensland State Government and the Commonwealth on <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster relief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What, if any, consideration has the Government given to the proposal for the establishment of a <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster research unit, made by the Member for Hawker, on 6 May 1 976 (vide House of Representatives  Hansard,  page 2005 ). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consideration has been given to issues raised by the proposal made by the Honourable Member for Hawker in the context of the question of a <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster insurance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government recognises that the success of such a scheme- to which the government is committed in principlewill depend, in part, upon the formulation and pursuit of appropriate policies to mitigate the incidence of losses to property arising from <span class="highlight">natural</span> hazards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the considerations which led to the proposal (outlined in the discussion paper on a proposed <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster insurance scheme released on 8 December 1976 by the Minister for Post and Telecommunications and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) that a Mitigation Committee be established to advise on appropriate policies directed at improving <span class="highlight">natural</span> hazard risks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is envisaged that, as the question of a <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster insurance scheme is further considered by the Government examination will be given to the question whether, and if so what, action to facilitate improved co-ordination of research in this area on a continuing basis would be appropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These have included displaced and stateless persons, those seeking political asylum, defectors, members of oppressed minorities and victims of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-65">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>and (2) The Commonwealth has agreed to support, under the <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster assistance arrangements, expenditures by the Queensland Government on the following relief and restoration measures arising out of Cyclone Ted: relief of personal hardship and distress emergency repair and protection works restoration of State Government assets restoration of local and semi-government authority assets loans to primary producers road and rail freight concessions to primary producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-97">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the nature of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster expenditure cost sharing arrangements it is impracticable to specify what proportion of total expenditures arising out of a particular disaster are met from State resources and what proportion from Commonwealth resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-97">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe it is <span class="highlight">natural</span> that people arriving in this country will find it difficult to find a job in the immediate sense in terms of one week or two weeks but it seems from the statistics that are available that there has been a fall in the period of time that migrants have spent looking for work after their arrival in this country and that, in fact, this trend is continuing despite the present difficult times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The beneficial effects, both physical and psychological, to mother and infant of <span class="highlight">natural</span> feeding, have been convincingly established, and the present provisions for paternity leave recognise the positive good a father’s assistance and participation at this stage in his child ‘s development can do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-1-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we look at the waste releases we find that 7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide are released from a coal powered station, 1 million tonnes from a fuel oil station and 60 billion cubic feet from a <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas powered station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So it is worth mentioning that the world’s resources are mainly coal 70 per cent, with important contributions from oil 14 per cent and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas 12 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Oil accounts for just over one per cent of our fossil fuel reserves, and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas for about  Vh  per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The first is that oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas represent a small proportion of our non-renewable energy resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We depend today almost totally on the non-renewable energy resources, so it is worth mentioning that the world’s resources are mainly coal (70 per cent), with important contributions from oil (14 per cent) and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas (12 per cent), while uranium currently makes up less than 5 per cent of the world’s non-renewable energy resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our resources of oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas are much smaller; oil accounts for just over I per cent of our fossil-fuel reserves, and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas about  Vh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that oil and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas represent a small proportion of our non-renewable energy resources, and so these fuels will rapidly become scarce or expensive (or both). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, both Australia and the world generally do face an energy crisis during the next 10-30 years as supplies of oil (and, to a lesser extent, <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas) become scarcer or more expensive or, most probably both scarcer and more expensive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The significant thing about him was that his contribution to this country changed not only the policy of the Australian Labor Party but also the policy of Australian governments, because there is no question that since 1972 there has been a much greater awareness on both sides of the Parliament and in the Australian community at large of the tremendous importance of the development of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He fought for that point of view within the party room and at the last Federal Conference of our party which he attended at Terrigal in New South Wales where he made the important distinction that our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources should be developed by the public sector so that the tremendous benefits from such development would flow directly back to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that because of the inclusion of primary producers’ taxation returns under the stock valuation concession scheme hundreds of tax accountants in rural areas have run into insoluble problems in assessing primary producers’ incomes under the market selling value criteria where flocks or herds comprise animals born on the property, that is, <span class="highlight">natural</span> increase, and others bought in? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This decision, taken in a period of economic constraint, is a clear recognition by the Government of the need to ensure that Australia is in a position to benefit from advances in space technology particularly where such benefits lead to better exploitation and management of our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it the Government’s intention to continue to make funds available for a freight assistance subsidy on the movement of cattle to abattoirs, rail-heads, markets et cetera, in the Northern Territory in view of the depressed situation in primary industry and the fact that the <span class="highlight">natural</span> increase in cattle population means that cattle numbers in many areas will be far in excess of the safe cattle carrying capacity of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is urgent that the Senate and the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled, will observe <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice and proper humanity by inviting only authorised representatives of the present Rhodesian Parliament to Australia, to do what they have been deprived of doing previously, present their case fully and publicly so that this can be examined and tested, without interference, and so that the eventual impact on Australia ‘s own security and defence alliances can be gauged with better accuracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What we have said is that an incoming Labor Government will allow exports of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas from the North West Shelf sufficient to justify development expenditure but no more than should be allowed in the national interest having regard to Australia’s domestic needs for hydrocarbons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, the infrastructure established by an export market can supplement Western Australia’s vital energy needs with <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas in the coming decades. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, with the agreement by the Government for the exporting of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas to the various overseas markets, if this gas were to be exported from Sydney, there is a great risk that we would be confining ourselves to one market only and that would be the American market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Together with  Mr Hall  as he then was,  Senator Hall  now, who was leader of the Liberal Opposition in that State, we did our best to persuade the then Labor Government to spend an additional Sl.Sm to provide <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas to the Spencer Gulf area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second element recommended by the Ranger Inquiry was the development of specific arrangements to protect the <span class="highlight">natural</span> and historic features of the Alligator Rivers environment, to protect the Aboriginal people who have lived there for centuries and to protect the mine workers and their families who will take up residence there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only question for the Court will be whether the action is lawful, in the sense that it is within the power conferred on the relevant Minister or official or body, that prescribed procedures have been followed and that general rules of law, such as conformity to the principles of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice, have been observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770906_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the underhanded methods used to bring alleged charges against TTLC Secretary Bob Watling and Peter Imlach, the denial to them of their rights and adequate notice, the breaches of ALP rules which have been perpetrated by the Rules Committee and the tribunal are so fundamentally opposed to <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice and the good name of the Party as to require the firmest challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770906_senate_30_s74/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The meeting came out of a situation that arose when I was talking to them last year and I was saying- I repeat it here because I think it is worth repeating- that Australian manufacturing ought to be capable of being based upon the adding of value to the <span class="highlight">natural</span> materials we have and the products and resources of the Australian countryside, whether they are grown, harvested or mined in the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the great problems is that the river is a <span class="highlight">natural</span> stream, but because of the dams, the construction work, the irrigation work, all the things that have happened on the river over the centuries, it has more or less become a drain for artificial purposes and not a <span class="highlight">natural</span> water course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course if we do not have the funds here to retain the expertise which has been so evident in this country, it is only <span class="highlight">natural</span> that those people will go to a country like America where ample funds are available so that they can expand their knowledge in the development of solar energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main policy initiatives we as a Government have taken in the field of energy policy over the last couple of years have been in the areas of mining taxation incentives, energy pricing, the administration of export controls, foreign investment guidelines, decisions on the development of uranium and <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas resources, assistance to energy research and development, and the formation of energy consultative and advisory bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the second half of the twentieth century, there has been a thrust in law making for areas clearly that are beyond the <span class="highlight">natural</span> jurisdiction of nations- for example, the moon, outer space and the seabed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>True, very true, but because our State governments did not have the foresight to cater adequately for the needs of a growing metropolis it has been found necessary to pump up from our water-table millions of litres or millilitres- I am not terribly sure about the metric system so perhaps I can just say millions of gallons- into our <span class="highlight">natural</span> catchment system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Toomer ‘s original sin was that, as a public servant, he said in public that our quarantine regulations were sub-standard; that we did not have adequate protection from exotic diseases; that we did not have protection from such diseases as foot-and-mouth disease and bluetongue; that he condemned the fact that he was unable to take unto himself authority to destroy vessels which had landed illegally on the west coast of Western Australia and which he considered could have contained some vermin which we did not need, which could have affected our <span class="highlight">natural</span> flora and fauna, and which he wanted to prevent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer again also to the fact that primary industry is the greatest <span class="highlight">natural</span> enterprise that Australians can follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The immediate purpose of the visit was to familiarise the Committee with features of the Region, including its topography, ecology, <span class="highlight">natural</span> drainage, Aboriginal sacred sites, points of scenic interest, and places in the neighbourhood of the projected mines and town sites which could be effected by their operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under a normal program under which the State applies to the Commonwealth for assistance in the event of some <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster, the Commonwealth imposes a certain base figure on every State before it will commit itself to any assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The inability to predict what will happen in two, three or four years time has been sufficiently demonstrated for us not to attempt to predict what will happen in the year 2020- especially when one considers that wars do occur, that <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters occur and that great economic dislocation occurs also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the definition of ‘parent’ for the purposes of the Scheme is very broad; any person who has accepted financial responsibility for a school-age senior secondary student who is no longer in the care of his <span class="highlight">natural</span> or adoptive parents may apply for benefits on the student’s behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-59-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Moreover, the previous arrangement had led to some anomalies, including the possibility of payment of full benefits to some students who, whilst no longer supported by <span class="highlight">natural</span> or adoptive parents, were none the less in the care of quite well to do relatives or friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-59-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister confirm that if Public Service or other Commonwealth Government staff levels are to be further affected by such decisions, any cuts will be achieved by the process of what is usually referred to as <span class="highlight">natural</span> wastage, such as retirement and resignation, and not by retrenchments in the public sector? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am advised that should it become necessary to examine Budget expenditures along these lines and a reduction in staff numbers is decided upon in the light of circumstances then existing, it would be the Government’s continued approach to seek to achieve the reduction, wherever possible, by <span class="highlight">natural</span> staff wastage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very good that they should seek new directions but it is bad if their <span class="highlight">natural</span> urge to do these things is thwarted because, if it is thwarted, those efforts and those <span class="highlight">natural</span> drives will be turned in bad directions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The resource tax would be implemented to cream off some of the excessive profits of mining companies which are exploiting a <span class="highlight">natural</span> resource which belongs to Australians- a fact which is recognised even by the Queensland Government in its taxing of mining company arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me stress that, as  Senator Gietzelt  will know, the island of Timor is one of the most formidably inhospitable places, particularly in the hill country, with very little <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources in terms of foodstuffs, and that in ordinary times the people have very poor health generally and very poor nutrition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Using that basis of a threshold rate of return of 1 5 per cent after company tax, I seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard  a table prepared by the Finance, Industries, Trade Development Group of the Legislative Research Service which shows the revenue raising potential of a resource tax applied to Gippsland crude oil, <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and liquid petroleum gas production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For some reason the imposition of this particular resources tax was abandoned by the Government on 2 July and the only reason in the absence of any technical Treasury reasons advanced by the Government- that has not been done- is simply that the Government is succumbing to political pressure from those industries which extract Australian <span class="highlight">natural</span> energy resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a time when liquid and gas fuels are becoming scarce, it is pertinent to ask whether alumina production on the scale envisaged is the best use of a versatile energy resource such as <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That 10-year gap is immensely important because, in the last 10 years there has been such a rapid development of technology, particularly computer technology that the <span class="highlight">natural</span> movement towards employment in the service sector that might have taken place is very likely to be aborted by the replacement of employees by technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On 21 September 1978  (Hansard,  pages 816-817)  Senator Walsh  asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice seeking details of the new <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster assistance cost-sharing arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States and inquiring whether the new arrangements would apply, in the case of Western Australia, to expenditure arising from damage caused in the previous financial year by Cyclone Alby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-38-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Bearing that in mind, I suppose it was <span class="highlight">natural</span> that those in power at the time developed manufacturing policies designed to substitute Australian made goods for imported goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my opinion and in the opinion of many people the real purpose for not carrying out these surveys is that the Government is trying to cover up, from Australia at large, what countries and companies are investing in Australia and buying our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources which, in whole truth, belong to Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it possible for an organisation such as the St John’s Ambulance Service to purchase a four-wheel drive vehicle without having to pay the import duties and tariffs normally associated with a transaction of this nature, bearing in mind, of course, that the vehicle would be a fully equipped ambulance to be used solely to bring aid to those injured in off-road accidents or to render assistance in areas devastated by <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters such as bushfires or cyclones similar to Cyclone Alby which brought great havoc to a large area of Western Australia not long ago? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These principles can be summed up in the following way: the primary aim of disciplinary provisions should be to facilitate efficient administration and public confidence in the integrity of the administration; there should be no unnecessary concern with the private lives of staff members; provisions should be seen as a complement to other management processes of supervision, leadership and staff counselling, with disciplinary action generally being a last resort; the disciplinary process should continue to be essentially administrative rather than judicial, but the principles of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice and fairness should be observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is this expected return on investment consistent with the Government’s attempt to curb rising health costs, especially those generated by hospitals, and is it not considered almost unethical and immoral for multinational organisations not only to monopolise our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources but also to plan to turn the misfortune of sickness and ill-health into a profit-making investment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was the <span class="highlight">natural</span> forces in the market place that eventually placed vast areas of Chinese property- virtually all Chinese property- in the hands of two related families, the Chiangs and the Soongs, and created the strains that led to the success of the communist revolution late in 1949. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result, supplies of both goods and services have declined; human resources are wasted, capital resources are not used and <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources are left under-developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-1-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because the Redcliff project would use indigenous <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources as feedstock, would it not be to the advantage of Australia for the Government to encourage the setting up of a chemical plant at Redcliff in South Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of increasing development of <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources in the marine environment of particular interest to Australia, such as proposals to explore for oil on the Great Barrier Reef, and also because of the growing risk of pollution of Australian coastal waters, the following matter be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment: Australian marine science, including the development of a marine science program for Australia, in the tropical, temperate and sub-Antarctica waters and the coordination of research efforts between the various agencies involved in these areas of marine science, fisheries development and oceanography’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Strange as it may seem, it is estimated that 600,000 metric tons of oil seep to the surface throughout the world every year through <span class="highlight">natural</span> seepage from the oilfields underneath. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It must be said that the Santa Barbara area also has <span class="highlight">natural</span> oil seepage all the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Obviously if there is no oil there the clear indications are that there are other types of hydrocarbons available on the Reef, to wit <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not an academic argument; it is a case of whether we are to save the Barrier Reef or whether we are to rape it in the same way as we do many of our other <span class="highlight">natural</span> assets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Collard  ‘s arguments would be understandable if he were in the old brigade, in his 70s or 80s, because then he would not be too worried about what was done to our <span class="highlight">natural</span> assets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1975 when the Government came into power its members made all sorts of pious utterings about how they would protect our <span class="highlight">natural</span> wonders, including the Great Barrier Reef, but they have progressively moved away from that stance ever since. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I preface my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate by stating that despite commitments by  Mr Lynch  in March 1976 and  Mr Eric  Robinson in December 1976 that the Government would introduce a <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster insurance scheme, the Government has now, three years later, decided to scrap the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is this not a sellout of property holders in potential <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster areas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The departments which will be co-ordinating the arrangements include my own Department of Science and the Environment and the Department of Defence which also incorporates the <span class="highlight">Natural</span> Disasters Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is, and no doubt there always will be, a basic conflict of interest between say, the United States purchasers of Australian resources, whether they be alumina, zinc, uranium or <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas, and the Australian business enterprise exporting the commodity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That country’s chief exports are dependent not upon <span class="highlight">natural</span> resource-type products but rather upon manufactured products which are gauged against and sold against a very competitive market in the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>to promote, by the encouragement and co-ordination of research and other appropriate means, the identification of, and development of understanding of, the factors affecting marital and family stability in Australia, with the object of promoting the protection of the family as the <span class="highlight">natural</span> and fundamental group unit in society; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be more specific, there is a reference to the protection of the family as the <span class="highlight">natural</span> and fundamental group unit in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that there are some reasons for querying whether we are stuck with the notion of the nuclear family as the most <span class="highlight">natural</span> and desirable group unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Natural</span> disasters were also mentioned, in which case the Commonwealth and State governments publicly agreed on the policy guidelines that were to be followed in administering loans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the immediate reaction, of course, as I assume the Premier intended, was a wave of sympathy for the Beggs family: How could anyone be so cruel, it was implicitly argued, as to criticise the providing of a bit of financial assistance by way of cheap money to a poor Western District family that had been burnt out of house and home by a <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the view of such a disaster, if relevant- and it ceased to be relevant in this instance as soon as the SEC paid the compensation- would be that it would be wrong to compensate people who lost property in <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters if they could insure themselves against such loss. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the question of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters- since some people have related this whole question to <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters- it should also be put on the record that on 9 June last year,  Mr Anthony,  presumably in the capacity of Acting Prime Minister, sent a telex to the South Australian Minister of Agriculture regarding payments of Commonwealth funds for disaster relief because of the drought that State was suffering last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Funds flow also to people in rural areas through the <span class="highlight">natural</span> disaster relief arrangements which also were the subject of criticism by  Senator Walsh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Rural Finance Commission makes loans solely in accordance with its own judgments and in accordance with guidelines determined by the Commission itself and in the case of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters on guidelines determined by public agreement between governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia has a number of very great <span class="highlight">natural</span> advantages in terms of climate, beaches and so on which, as the commentators to which I have referred point out, should give us a particular advantage compared with many other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have commented that, in the generality, in the <span class="highlight">natural</span> course of things, those who are now teachers, with few exceptions, transferred from school to university or college and then back to school without obviously being able to gain any kind of practical experience of the outside world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a <span class="highlight">natural</span> community concern about an activity which threatens the extinction of any species, particularly when it is directed against a species as special and intelligent as the whale and there is a fear that the continued existence of these special forms of wildlife are threatened by continued exploitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All honourable senators who have read the report will agree that it is a well reasoned and comprehensive document and it has led to this Government’s total commitment to protect the whale so that present and future generations of Australians can have the opportunity of seeing these wonderful mammals in their <span class="highlight">natural</span> habitat rather than seeing them merely as exhibits of an extinct species in a museum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Implementation of the land use strategy was recommended to be achieved through the mechanism of a formal plan of management as provided for in the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act on the basis that this provides flexibility, co-ordinated management and consequently efficient use of human and <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having explained the Government’s intention to have more vehicles currently burning petrol converted to <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas he said on page 26: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the Government’s policy in respect of the pricing of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Mr Keating  eloquently pointed out in his paper, the Victorian Government is producing base-load electricity from <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas priced at 20 per cent of opportunity cost and is talking about producing simultaneously synthetic oil from brown coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Keating’s second point was that geologically, there is more prospect in Australia of finding <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas than oil and that gas is the best raw material for a liquid fuel substitute for petroleum, much cheaper and simpler with present or foreseeable technology than either ethanol from crops or synthetic oil from coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does it endorse the Victorian Government’s current actions of generating base load electricity from <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas, which is technically and economically by far the best substitute raw material for liquid fuel, while the same Government talks about producing synthetic oil from brown coal? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government, which controls enormous reserves of brown coal which is suitable for the generation of base load electricity and totally unsuitable for the production of synthetic oil, burns <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas to produce electricity and talks about turning brown coal into synthetic oil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were told also by  Mr Newman,  through  Mr Cotter,  how unwise it was for governments to tamper with <span class="highlight">natural</span> market prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the next page he was boasting about what a great idea it was to tamper with the <span class="highlight">natural</span> market price of fuel in inland centres by subsidising the freight costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because the Redcliff project would use indigenous <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources as feedstock, would it not be to the advantage of Australia for the Government to encourage the setting up of a chemical plant at Redcliff in South Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to the substance of what is being said, it is completely outside all the normal procedures of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice and of this Parliament that one should seek to form prejudgments on part of a report and in the knowledge that it is in the hands of a government to take action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is to be a question of standards, what about the standards of a State Labor government which yesterday quite obviously sought to “give every kind of preference to the Labor Party by giving prior knowledge and advantage of a situation and which did not seek, in terms of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice, to put the whole of the report together in one tabled statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the meantime I ask that those who have even a shred of sense of values in terms of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice wait till the report is complete, till the State Government has made its recommendations and, if those recommendations involve prosecutions, to leave it to the courts to decide the truth in terms of judgmental values. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It relates to CSR Ltd, a company which has had a lifetime of association with Queensland, a company which is a major Australian company, a company which wishes to become further involved in the development of Australia, a company which I believe is well managed, a company which is significant and a company which ought to have the opportunity, if the market forces permit it, to be able to participate in a take-over and development to maximise the efficiency of the operation of the whole capital market system without interference by a State Premier who apparently regards anything which comes from south of the border of Queensland as beyond the pale and, if necessary, to be kept out of the development of a national attitude, a national development, a national efficiency on the basis that a company, even with that background of association with Queensland, is not to be allowed to participate in a take-over or a take-over attempt, which is <span class="highlight">natural</span> within our total system, because it is not based on a totally Queensland shareholding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-70">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Leader of the Government in the Senate see the article in today’s  Australian  relating to a report yesterday from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources which called for much greater Australian use and, by implication, consumption of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas as opposed to exporting this valuable fuel? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As this report from the CSIRO is so obviously relevant and correct, will the Government immediately increase the incentives for the use of <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas and other hydrocarbon gaseous fuels in Australia so that a total embargo on the export of gaseous hydrocarbons can be brought down as soon as possible? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are aimed at assisting the fulfilment of the objective of encouraging conservation of energy- in particular, liquid fuels other than LPG- and promoting the use of alternative energy sources such as <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas, LPG, coal-based electricity and solar energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These provisions will exempt goods for use in the conversion of internal combustion engines to liquefied petroleum gas or <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas operation; non-oil burning domestic space heating appliances; and various solar energy appliances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As compressed <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas is emerging as an alternative motor vehicle fuel, it is proposed that the exemption for engine conversion kits apply to goods for use in conversions to <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas as well as to conversions to LPG. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But any political passion for equality wrecks any hope of freedom because <span class="highlight">natural</span> law springs from two principles; firstly, self-preservation; and, secondly, a <span class="highlight">natural</span> repugnance to unwarranted infliction of pain and death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recent theoretical models for Pacific co-operation advanced by academics are based on the striking economic growth achieved by a number of developing countries in the region in recent years and growing economic interdependence as well as the vast <span class="highlight">natural</span> endowments and rapid technological change in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We can only record the regret of the Commonwealth Government that people have suffered and its willingness to be helpful in the sphere of <span class="highlight">natural</span> disasters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Naturally, the Opposition is concerned that the mentality or philosophy that seems to be characteristic of mining companies is seen in a proper perspective, having regard to our fundamental commitment and obligation to protect the rights of Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nobody in the Senate or in the Parliament would deny, I am sure, that here we have a major area of public conflict between the landowners and those who want to develop the land for various reasons,  including  the exploitation of <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources in a particular region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The foreign exchange that overseas tourists bring to this country and the great <span class="highlight">natural</span> assets that we have for the tourist hold out the promise of rich rewards to our balance of payments and, most importantly, provide employment for many people in this country serving those tourists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would understand, if not entirely applaud the Government’s attitude, if it simply did not want to create a proliferation of statutory bodies perhaps because of some intimidation from  Senator Rae,  who seems to regard it as a matter of moral evil for a statutory body to be created these days unless there is some overwhelming justification for it, such that all mortal men, <span class="highlight">natural</span> or otherwise, would unequivocally agree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is the practice of the Department to conform to these basic rules of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice: (a) for what length of time is the notice which is provided; (b) what details of the evidence are provided (for example, reports of field officers, the names of informants, and copies of all statements); and (c) is the pensioner or beneficiary permitted to make an oral or written representation to the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Department, if the notice, information and opportunity referred to in (1) above are not provided, restructure its procedures in view of the serious invasion of the rights of pensioners and beneficiaries involved in such a denial of <span class="highlight">natural</span> justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe even more urgently that there should be incentives to Australian industry, perhaps totalling $200m or as close to that figure as possible, to work, especially with the Northwest Shelf consortium, to ensure that there is rapid construction of at least one plant, possibly two 5,000 tonne a day plants, based on known technology, to produce methanol and other forms of alcohol useful as a motor spirit from the North- West Shelf <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The real goer here is methanol from our <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could then have higher consumption of methanol as we built more plants on <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The industrial revolution happened, and could only have happened, in a society that had developed a theoretical intellectual system, <span class="highlight">natural</span> science and a pre-industrial technology of a high order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nothing could be a greater contrast to the Protestant work ethic than India’s Hinduism, a religion of <span class="highlight">natural</span> order, of predestination manifest in fixed castes, with a transmigration of souls in union and reunion with the absolute spirit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The complex interrelationship of the <span class="highlight">natural</span> ecology is gradually being accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could be said that this is an encouragement to develop our <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources, but the whole situation rests on the fact that the Government is allowing our resources to be pillaged by people whose interests are overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the <span class="highlight">natural</span> resources of Australia and in particular the uranium deposits of the Northern Territory should be exploited by companies which have substantial Australian interests so that the benefits accrue to all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps the most significant part of that sort of aid is that it is closely related to the <span class="highlight">natural</span> history and development of those societies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-85">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The purpose of the Bill before the Senate is to authorise the Pipeline Authority to construct a <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas pipeline from Young on the main Moomba to Sydney pipeline to Cootamundra and Wagga Wagga. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-97-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When completed the pipeline will be operated and maintained by the Pipeline Authority, carrying <span class="highlight">natural</span> gas from the Cooper Basin gas fields in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-97-0">[More…]</a></p>
