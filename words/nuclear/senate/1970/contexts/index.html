<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It refers to the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests which are to be held in the Pacific area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the part of  Senator Keeffe’s  question which suggested that there had been some extraordinary discussions between this Government and the DLP in relation to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons is sheer nonsense and humbug. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700519_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question referred to political arrangements - arrangements between parties in relation to the establishment of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700519_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government decided to buy for the Jervis Bay power station the type of atomic plant that produces the most <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosive material? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700519_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government already decided that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power is economic for Australia when there is a large body of opinion to the contrary, especially among senior engineers in power authorities in the States? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700519_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government made a deal with the Democratic Labor Party to equip Australia with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700519_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Government intending to negate and repudiate the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Weapons which it signed so grudgingly? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700519_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the French Government intend commencing a new series of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons tests in the Pacific area soon; if so, what action does the Commonwealth Government intend taking to ; prevent such tests being carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister recall that recently I drew attention to a thermonuclear weapon of such magnitude that it could cause tidal waves or earthquakes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the after effects of 2 separate <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testings by the French Government in the Pacific, resulting in the massive tragedy of earthquakes in South America, will the Australian Government launch a strong protest to the United Nations Security Council against further testing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons and press for the initiation of an inquiry in depth into the relationship between <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing and earthquakes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that the Australian Government made representations and expressed its views on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing by the French Government in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not like to comment on any suggestion in the Senate of Australia about the association between <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing in the Pacific and the earthquakes which have happened in Peru. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who prepared the specifications for Australia’s proposed <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-92-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government received any report and/or results of feasibility tests with respect to the economic potential of the proposed Jervis Bay <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plant; if so, has this information been compared with the known cost of production of electrical energy produced by conventional means, and what does a comparison disclose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government or the Atomic Energy Commission considered the feasibility of installing a combined <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power/desalination plant at Chowilla; if so, what conclusion has been reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701013_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(i) Establishment of the proposed Department of <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Medicine has been deferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710520_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.I refer to
            a recently published American book in which it was stated that Pine Gap was part of
            the American chain of communications directing America’s <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this mean that Pine Gap,
            perhaps Alice Springs or even Adelaide, will be early targets for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> attacks in
            the event of a major war? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Isthe Nattai River, 30 miles from Sydney, under consideration as a site; if so, would selection of this site make Sydney a prime <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> target. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister representing the Minister for National Development inform the Senate of the present stage in the planning of the proposed <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station at Jervis Bay? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister representing the Minister for National Development seen a publication by Professor H. J. de Brium of the School of Physical Science at the Flinders University in South Australia in which he suggests amendments to the Atomic Energy Act 1953 to institute a body of review to supervise future <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> development in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister consider this article which suggests future investigation into <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power for water desalination rather than for electricity generation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Chairman  of the Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee said that he had visited Paris twice and had also visited the Pacific test site in connection with the recent series of French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has been the total expenditure to date on the now deferred Jervis Bay <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Power Station Project, and will the Minister provide a breakdown of this expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-114-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Director of the Australian Conservation Foundation wrote to me on 29th June 1972 informing me that the Foundation had issued a statement unequivocally opposing the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests on environmental grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There has been talk in New Zealand of a ship going into the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test zone but there has been no such discussion in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the AttorneyGeneral confirm the recent statement of the Prime Minister that Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fallout over Australia is one-tenth of the French fallout over this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it of some interest that the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  in a considered statement has said that the reports of the National Radiation Advisory Committee and the Australian Academy of Science establish that the people of Australia may - I emphasise that word ‘may’ - have been adversely affected by France holding <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave - I inform the Senate that the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Attorney-General and Minister for Customs and Excise  (Senator Murphy)  left Australia on Sunday, 13 th May, to present Australia’s case against French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing in the Pacific to the International Court of Justice at The Hague. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the announcement by the Government of the People’s Republic of China that its research and development program for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testings, is not yet complete, has the Australian Government sought to ascertain the possible dates and locations of the next series of Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What was the date of the most recent protest to The People’s Republic of China by the Australian Government against the testing by China of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> devices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government, in the light of its proposal to refer the question of French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing in the Pacific to the International Court of Justice, also be prepared to do likewise on the question of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing by Communist China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Attorney-General able to confirm the recent statement of the Prime Minister that Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fall-out over Australia is one-tenth of that of the French fall-out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ask the Minister assisting the Minister for Defence: In view of the discrepancies concerning the number of naval persons not wishing to sail on HMAS Sydney’ if it is to take part in the protest against the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests, will the Minister put down a statement listing the numbers and the designations of those involved and the reasons for their not participating in the operation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is estimated that the costs that will be incurred by the Australian Government in respect of the hearing of Australia’s request to the Court for ‘provisional measures’ restraining France from conducting further <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in the atmosphere will total $138,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the Senate deplores the Government’s double standards in respect of atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing by China and France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me make it clear at the outset that the Opposition condemns all atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing wherever it is conducted and by whomever it is conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former Minister for Foreign Affairs, the honourable Nigel Bowen, led in the United Nations the condemnation of all atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Mr President, there has never been any doubt as to where the Australian Labor Party stands on the matter of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The fact that the honourable senator has this motion on the Senate notice paper shows that in his inner-most soul he would like to use the thermo-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bomb to solve his problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only a small step from a militarist coup that would destroy a democractic Government to the same desperado who will press the button and drop a thermo-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bomb if he believes this will give him an advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable senators I table letters sent by the Prime Minister to the  President  of the United States and the Prime Minister of Canada both dated 4 February 1977, relating to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Have employees, and former employees, engaged in exploration and development of uranium mining in Australia and persons associated with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> experiments in the Monte Bello Islands and other areas ever been medically examined in order to ascertain if they have been affected in any way by radiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What steps has the Government taken, or will it take, to implement the recommendations of the first report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry which states that immediate and urgent energy research and development programs should be undertaken into (a) liquid fuels to replace petroleum and (b) energy sources other than fossil and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Important though these considerations are in foreign policy terms, I wish now to concentrate on the relationship between uranium export and the problem of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly we must regard most seriously the Inquiry’s findings that ‘the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war’ and that ‘this is the most serious hazard associated with the industry’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s comprehensive <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards policy announced by the Prime Minister on 24 May is designed to do just that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The requirement under our policy for International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards to be applied to any <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material supplied by Australia in the existing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons countries, as well as in non.nunclear weapon states, is additional to these recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So are the requirements for prior Australian consent to high enrichment and reprocessing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material supplied by Australia and the requirement that adequate physical security be maintained on the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industries of uranium importing countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4) If this recommendation is not to be implemented, does this not negate this Government’s promise that all possible safeguards in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry will be enforced in the event of a go-ahead for the industry in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The estimate of installed <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> capacity of 325 gigawatts in OECD countries (not world) referred to in part (1) of the question, was published by the OECD in ‘World Energy Outlook: A Reassessment of Long Term Energy Developments and Related Policies’ early this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As required of a party to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Weapons (NPT), Australia advises the International Atomic Energy Agency of the quantity, composition and destination of the material exported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Safeguards Office also advises other national <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material control authorities to ensure continuing application of national safeguarding measures, including physical security, after the material leaves Australian jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) In the light of the recent Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development’s review of world energy requirements to 1985 where it is stated that the world forecasted <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> capacity of 513 gigawatts by 1985 had been revised to 325 gigawatts by 1985 and in the light of large reductions in the forecasted <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> capacity of Japan, Germany and Great Britain, what countries will be markets for Australian uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How have these revised <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> capacity forecasts affected the predicted requirements for Australian uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this indicate that the cry by <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> proponents for the immediate sale of Australia’s uranium because of the world ‘s great need for it are inaccurate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do these downward revisions of world <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> capacity now mean that Australia can afford to take more time to publicly debate the pros and cons of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power without having to hurry debate in order to supply an energy hungry world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This has nothing to do with the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards policy which is designed to prevent <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material being diverted to non-peaceful or explosive purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>STATEMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA ON THE OCCASION OF THE SIGNING OF THE <span class="highlight">NUCLEAR</span> NONPROLIFERATION TREATY <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In April 1968 when the treaty to prevent the further spread of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons was introduced in the United Nations General Assembly Australia supported the resolution commending the treaty for the consideration of governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is conscious of the fact that in the long run the security of the world as a whole will depend upon effective measures to control the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> arms race and to bring about general and complete disarmament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attaches weight to the statements by the governments of the United States, United Kingdom and the Soviet Union declaring their intention to seek immediate Security Council action to provide help to any nonnuclear weapons State party to the treaty that is subject to aggression or the threat of aggression with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notes that the treaty will in no way inhibit and is in fact designed to assist non-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon States in their research, development and use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions for peaceful purposes either individually or collectively; nor must it discriminate against any State or States in their peaceful pursuits in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Considers it essential that the inspection and safeguards arrangements should not burden research, development, production and use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy for peaceful purposes: that they should not constitute an obstacle to a nation’s economic development, commercial interests and trade; and that they should be effective in ensuring that any breaches of the treaty would be detected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Welcomes the fact that the treaty in Articles 4 and 5 provides for international cooperation for the development of the peaceful uses of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and the peaceful applications of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions; notes the assurances that under the treaty the supply of knowledge, materials and equipment would not be denied to any party; and considers it important that no <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> development should be prohibited except when such activities would have no other purpose than the manufacture of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons or other <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosive devices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will co-operate closely with other governments in seeking clarifications and understandings in relation to those matters which must be resolved before Australia could proceed to ratification, being convinced that a treaty which was truly effective in preventing the further proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons would be a major contribution to the security of the world as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nobody knows what will happen in the next decade, but at least we know that there is a better chance in having the existing atomic powers joined in even some loose federation than by drifting out into the unknown while fearing that at any time China might achieve <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> parity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When embarking on an argument about the non-proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons and the problem of expansion, those of my juniors who lived through the period will recall the tragedy that occurred when we experimented with the inspection of weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The terrible concern that people in Australia have is not that members of the DLP are hypocritical but that they mean what they say when they say that we should be refusing to ratify the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Non-proliferation Treaty and when they say that we should be acquiring <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> arms of our own, so setting off a race and a chain reaction among all the smaller nations around the world to acquire <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> arms oftheir own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sooner the people of Australia start to understand that they cannot just cast members of the DLP aside and say: ‘They do not mean it when they talk about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> arms; they do not mean it when they say that they are prepared to put pressure on the Government’, and start to understand that they do mean what they say, that they have put pressure on the Government and that they have been able to succeed to a substantial degree, the better it will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part of Democratic Labor Party policy is for Australia to have <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> arms, to be armed to the teeth and to be able to take a posture by which we will make all the other nations of the world quiver. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National Radiation Advisory Committee in its most recently published Report - that of March 1969  -  concluded that the fallout over Australia from the most recent series of French <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Tests in the Pacific, like that from earlier French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests, was of no significance as a hazard to the health of the Australian population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The plain fact of the matter is that prior to the last elections the Prime Minister was adamant that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Weapons had a lot of dangers inherent in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Communist powers extend the national interest by all means at their disposal by internal subversion, limited wars, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> blackmail, armed intervention and the creation of subversive elements inside the countries they wish to reduce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first axiom that I put down is this: Australia has no defence or foreign policy initiatives in a thermo-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the event of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war no initiatives and no defence capacity are left to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, if this first axiom is accepted, as I believe it should be accepted, that there are no initiatives in terms of grant strategy or defence strategy or political overtures and initiatives in a thermo-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war, then we must ask ourselves: What is the situation in less than thermo-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> condition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to take a minute off to rebut the concept that the Australian Government was hawkish in refusing to sign the treaty relating to the non-proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We signed the treaty for the nonproliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons within 1 week of the Japanese Government signing it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second axiom is that, following from a situation less than a thermo-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> situation - this must be accepted and understood - Australia lives upon the periphery of an unstable regional area which I have just mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, the people of an island are able to move internally whereas any possible enemy short of a thermo <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war, would have to move around the outside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although the United States is a global power there are circumstances under terms of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> blackmail, for example, in which the United States could conceivably say to Australia: “There are circumstances in which we must ask you to release us, temporarily at any rate, from an undertaking that we have given to you’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It refers to the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests which are to be held in the Pacific area.I ask the Minister what special precautions against fall out or what programme for recording fall-out over Australia have been recommended by the Government during this week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In  its most recently published report - that  of  March 1969- the NRAC concluded that the fall-out over Australia from the most recent series of French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests  in  the Pacific, like that from earlier French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests was  of no  significance  as a  hazard  to  the health  of  the Australian population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As far as further tests by the French are concernedthe same monitoring programmes and assessments will be undertaken but the NRAC can see no reasonto depart from its conclusions that the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons tests are unlikely  to  be of significance as hazard to the health  of  the Australian population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It depends upon the type of reactor which is installed at the proposed <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station in New South Wales whether some of the Australian production of raw uranium or the derivatives of raw uranium can be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Leader of the Government in the Senate seen reports of statements made by a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> expert,  Mr H.  J. de Bruin, a former principal research scientist with the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, to the effect that the Jervis Bay <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station could not be justified on economic grounds? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Did he say that as a pilot plant for future <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> development in Austral’ a the $130m installation at Jervis Bay would be utterly extravagant? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As  Mr de  Bruin is only one of many persons whose voices have been raised against the economics, the possible danger of water pollution and other aspects of the proposed <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plant, will the Government delay acceptance of a lender until further expert investigation of all these contingencies has been carried out? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s decision for Australia to have <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> capacity for peaceful purposes is a good decision, a sound decision and a decision consistent with the Government’s approach to the progress and development of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until 1966, a research project of the Materials Division of the Atomic Energy Commission was concerned with ceramics based on beryllium oxide, which has special moderating properties in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700820_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This project involved an investigation of the technology of beryllia and berylliabased <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuels to establish whether the unique physical and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> properties of beryllia could lead to practical applications in high-temperature gas-cooled reactor systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700820_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This first plant is to enable experience to be gained in all stages of construction and operation, to assist in establishing a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry potential in Australia and to place us in a position to take advantage of the fast breeder <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors when they become available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the  Chairman  of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, in addressing a Liberal Speakers’ Conference in June 1969 state that Australia would spend$5,000m on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations by the year 2000; if so, on what basis was the estimate of power needs made, and how was it costed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He suggested that by the end of the century almost $5,000m might have been committed to the building of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations and the associated industry in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This figure was estimated from the predicted growth of power requirements in Australia and the capital investment in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power facilities overseas, and is in line with other estimates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As regards thermal effects, heat rejected from the turbine condensers of any power station, whether <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> or conventional, has an effect which must be considered in the location of the plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless as an added precaution detailed studies are being made of the ecology of the area so that a close watch can be maintained on any thermal and radioactive effects of theJervis Bay <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Power Station on the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Did the Government consider the possibility of building Australia’s first <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station as a combined power/ desalination plant, located on the coast of a dry area, where both power and fresh water are in demand: if so, why was such a possibility rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage of development of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry it is more economic to provide in dry coastal areas both power and water (including desalinated water) by conventional means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is theoretically possible to obtain both power and desalinated water from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plants at prices competitive with conventional means but only when extraordinarily large plants are constructed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Particular attention is given to these elements as they are considered potentially the most hazardous of the radioactive materials released to the environment in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second programme is directed mainly at the shorter-lived radio isotopes in fallout which may be of significance only in the few months immediately after <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of the latest French tests, the NRAC can see no reason to depart from its conclusion that the overall programme of French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in the Pacific is unlikely to be of significance as a hazard to the health ofthe Australian population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that we are to have a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> establishment at Jervis Bay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To that extent we are operating against the brain drain from Australia, but the Jervis Bay proposal has the purpose of providing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why was Australia’s first <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station not located in South Australia feeding into the Victorian and South Australian grids. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the statements made by  Mr H.  J. de Bruin, a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> expert and former Principal Research Scientist with the Australian Atomic Energy Commission to the  effect  that the establishment of the Jervis Bay <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station could not be justified on economic grounds, and that as a pilot plant for the future <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> development in Australia the $130m installation at Jervis Bay would be utterly extravagant, and in view of similar expressions of opinion which have been voiced against the economics of the power station and expounding the dangers of water and thermal pollution, will the Government delay acceptance of a tender until further expert investigation of  all  the possible contingencies has been undertaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its reasons for the project are  to  gain experience in all phases of tendering, construction and commissioning of  a  <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station;  to  encourage the commencement of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry in Australia; and as a result to be in a better position to be able to adopt fast breeder reactors when they become available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Atomic Energy Commission is aware of the characteristics of all types of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors in relation to the possible dangers of their releasing pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will) the proposed <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Power Station at Murray’s Beach, in the Jervis Bay region of New South Wales, require a causeway to he built across to Bowen Island; if so, what action will the Australian Atomic Energy Commission take to stop the influx of rats tothe island which has a thriving penguin rookery where the penguins’ eggs would be a prime target for rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the total cost of research in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> science at the Australian National University, fromits inception to the present date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of the Department of <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Physics at the Australian National University from inception in1950 to 31 December 1969 has been: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some costs of the Research School of Physical Sciences, of which the Department of <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Physics is a part, are not dissected on a Departmental basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, it has been necessary to estimate the proportions of those costs which might reasonably be ascribed to the Department or <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Physics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 suppose that Austrafia has to he with it scientifically and has to enter the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station club. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question, which I. direct to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, by referring to the Press release last weekend under the authority of the Minister for National Development and the New South Wales Minister for Labour and Industry which announced agreement on the construction and operation of the proposed <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station at Jervis Bay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consideration has been givento a proposal for a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station in South Eastern South Australia which would supply power to both the Victorian and South Australian Electricity systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Studies made in 1969 suggested that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power could be an important and economical supplement to our other sources of power in the late 1970s and thereafter, lt is known that the cost of energy from the Jervis Bay Plant in the initial stages of its production will be above the costs of the new large conventional stations operating in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government wishes Australia to obtain experience in ordering, commissioning and operating <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations and also wishes to assist in establishing a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry so that Australia will be in a favourable position to adopt fast breeder reactors when they become commercially available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement amongst other things will provide estimates of costs of production of electricity from the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> stations and conventional stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overseas studies indicate that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations with capacities of many thousands of megawatts would be necessary to obtain both cheap water and power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701013_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In addition there are very considerable technical problems to be solved before dual purpose <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> desalination plants of such sizes become practicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701013_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would add that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> units of such a size could not be fitted conveniently at present into any of the Australian electricity systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701013_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister provide for the Parliament an accurate assessment, in layman’s language, of the degree of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fallout in the eastern States of Australia as a result of recent French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bomb tests in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This network is supplemented to monitor shortlived radioisotope fallout immediately following <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister supply to the Parliament exact and up-to-date details of the measurements of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fallout elements: caesium 137, strontium 90 and iodine 131 for the areas of Launceston and the Atherton Tablelands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For long-lived radioisotopes it is on a continuous basis; for short-lived radioisotopes it is related to specific <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests or series of tests and includes monitoring of all major milk supplies for iodine 131 whenever it is present in fallout. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The monitoring of short-lived iodine 131 has operated for all <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons tests by France in Polynesia, namely those in 1966, 1967, 1968 and 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complete results from monitoring iodine131 fallout from the 1968 series of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests by France were published in the Australian Journal of Science of May 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that earlier this year  Senator Wilkinson  and 1 endeavoured to obtain some details of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fallout in areas of northern Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some weeks ago I asked the appropriate Minister whether he would supply to the Parliament exact and up to date details of measurements of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fallout elements caesium 137, strontium 90 and iodine 131 in the area of Launceston and the Atherton Tableland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister provide for the Parliament an accurate assessment in layman’s language of the degree of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fallout in the eastern States of Australia as a result of recent French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bomb tests in the Pacific? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My doubts have been reinforced by replies to questions we of the Opposition have asked about the establishment of the Jervis Bay <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the last occasion on which I asked in the Senate whether the type of establishment to be set up there would lend itself at a later date to the production of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons, I was told by the Minister concerned that it was not known what type would be set up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No attempt has been made to ratify the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those extracts from the scientific journals set out in scientific terms the fallout over Australia from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons tested by France in Polynesia from July 1968 to September 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average layman who has made no study of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fallout finds it virtually impossible to understand the statements in the journals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does the Government indulge in secrecy regarding fallout from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does it have no knowledge of what will happen about the establishment of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station at Jervis Bay? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate or, if it is more appropriate, the Minister representing the Minister for National Development, ls either Minister aware that an official statement has been made that waste from the Jervis  Bay  <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station will be buried in a remote area of the Northern Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701020_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will either Minister inform the Parliament as a matter of urgency of the exact area chosen for the disposal by burial of such <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701020_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That a select committee of the Senate should be appointed to inquire into and report on the uses of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power in relation to: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the effects of the establishment of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station upon the environment; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia is stepping into the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> era. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By ‘<span class="highlight">nuclear</span>’ I mean the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy for peaceful purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some time ago it was thought that Cape Keraudren would be a good place for the use of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosion to create a harbour on the extreme northern coast of Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When that project was abandoned the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and the Government moved quickly into the setting up of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station at Jervis Bay in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will note that the motion which I have moved on behalf of the Opposition seeks an inquiry into and a report on the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition does not oppose the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appreciates that it is probably necessary for Australia in this age to move into the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was once said by  Dr Edward  Teller that in principle <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors are dangerous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that in his opinion <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors do not belong on the surface of the earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those were very strong words from a man who I, would imagine has probably done as much work on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy as an engineer and knows as much about it as anybody in the world today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first question which has been raised by the body of opinion to which I have referred which is honestly seeking to set Australia on a proper course is whether a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> project should be established at Jervis Bay which is right in the middle of a coal belt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already referred to the fact that Australia is taking a very serious step in moving into the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> field, it should bc realised that some of the by-products of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy process will not dissipate in less than 1,000 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Professor Baxter, who is in charge of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission has said that probably in the next 30 years - before the turn of the century - $5,000m will be spent on the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power in Australia, In fairness to him I should make it clear that this amount will be spent not only by the Commonwealth but also by industry in Australia on the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is the tremendous seriousness of the step which Australia is about to take, and the dangers involved in the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is the question of the economics of the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition also seeks an inquiry into the effects of the establishment of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station upon the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in Australia are entering a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> era. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>but we know very little about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> station to be built at Jervis Bay could become a strategic target under extreme circumstances - for instance, during a bomb attack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is moving not only into the era of the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel for peaceful purposes but also into the era of a very real danger of a hit by a bomb, which would have the effect of an atomic bomb exploding there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The request lor amendment asks that a committee be appointed to inquire into the uses of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power in relation to:  administrative procedures and regulations adopted elsewhere to lessen any undesirable effects of the operation of such a station lo ensure the utmost protection of members of the public and the national interest; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final matter into which the committee should inquire is:  the desirability of establishing a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station at this time pending the outcome of further technological developments taking place elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is moving into the threshold of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> era. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the Government sees no need to have a select committee to inquire into the uses of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power, as proposed by the honourable senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This information included projected figures for installed <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generating capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In looking at the introduction of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power into Australia we must take into account not only the relative economics of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> and other forms of energy, but also the impact that this new technology will have on our industrial development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also to be considered the contribution that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power can make to a reduction in pollution of the environment, particularly in pollution of the atmosphere by harmful smoke and dust and various gases, sulphur and nitrogen oxides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has taken all these factors into account in deciding in principle to establish Australia’s first <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government of New South Wales is ready and willing to co-operate with the Commonwealth in establishing the first <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station on Commonwealth territory at Jervis Bay, and the Electricity Commission of New South Wales is to operate the station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The introduction of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power will bring abou! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will include the production in Australia of refined uranium for use in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor fuel, new metallic alloys, novel welding techniques, advanced types of electronic instruments and control equipment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The economics of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station depend upon many factors, including the capital cost of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plant itself and the cost of the fuel used to operate the plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> plant has a higher capital cost than coal fired units, but <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel is significantly cheaper than coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia is amongst the last 2 or 3 of the industrialised countries to introduce <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have here a lot of other information about fast breeder reactors operating best with plutonium as <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel, but in view of the sensible calculation of the Government that breeder reactors may not at this stage be within our capacity I do not propose to elaborate on it at great length. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This embraces the question of siting of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plants, their safety, standards of design, construction and operation and the training and efficiency of the maintenance and operating staff who would man them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also involves the control of plants and the manufacture of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel elements and other plants for chemical processing which use reactor fuel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By agreement with the States it has been instrumental in establishing the Commonwealth and States Consultative Committee on <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is making a detailed study of the regulatory framework necessary to ensure orderly, safe and economic development of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this respect 1 mentioned earlier that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations could be much more effective in restraining pollution of the atmosphere than some of the coal stations to which we have become accustomed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Civil Aviation  (Senator Cotton)  will no doubt recall that 1 have raised some questions with regard to safety measures to be adopted in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station proposed to be erected at Jervis Bay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in the replies I received it was fairly obvious that the Government thought I was concerned about the safety of personnel and the operating procedure followed at a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station of the very modern type proposed to be installed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are Swiss Aluminium Australia Pty Ltd and Gove Alumina Ltd, and Western <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> (Australia) Pty Ltd. At Groote Eylandt there is Groote Eylandt Mining Company Pty Ltd. Authority to prospect has been given to various companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But coal is a wasting asset and looking into the future it leads us in South Australia to feel that there is a very strong case - bearing in mind that we have no power source other than natural gas and the coal deposits to which 1 have referred - for South Australia to be given due consideration for the provision of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor to feed power into the State grids. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same lime a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor could deal with the other disadvantage from which we suffer and that is that we have only one major waterway to provide water over the bulk of the Stale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would be very interested to see the plans of the Atomic Energy Commission in respect of locations of future <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can see that these could well be a source of energy in South Australia and that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy could be a basic and major factor in our maintaining a viable place in the scheme of things as part of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of an official statement that waste front the proposed Jervis Bay <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Power Station will be buried in a remote area of the Northern Territory and an unofficial rumour that it is to be buried in a remote area of North Queensland, will the Minister inform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is not the Omega network associated with the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons, especially submarine missile carriers, which would draw <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> retaliation on its sites? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Would the installation of an Omega station in Tasmania constitute that State as a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> target? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe in the field of technology and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> science China is a reasonably inefficient member of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> club but there is no doubt and no gainsaying that it has <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Would the Minister for Health agree that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> medicine is one of the most important areas of modern medical practice, particularly in respect to up to date methods of diagnosis and surgery? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When will the successful tenderer for the construction of the Jervis Bay <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Power Station and the date of commencement of construction be announced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a tremendously urgent matter on the fringe of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> development in Australia and I .should like an answer before we rise for three months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I want to know is: What is Australia prepared to do to help the Pitcairn Islanders who are virtually isolated on a small island in the Pacific Ocean and ships will not go there and supply them with food and other requirements because the French Government is carrying out <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons trials in that area? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is that a group of people who have a great heritage - their ancestors were in the mutiny on the ‘Bounty’ and they are proud of the fact that on that occasion their ancestors were able to fight and get some kind of freedom - is now in an isolated corner of the Pacific without any prospects of receiving supplies because the Australian Government has not taken strong enough action at an international level to ensure that the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests which the French have carried out over a period of time are discontinued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests ships will no longer visit the area to supply the essential goods of life to these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government should give a lead to ensure that these people do not starve because some international power wants to exercise its rights to carry out <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests which are designed to destroy and not to enable human beings to survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the islanders of Pitcairn Island are virtually cut off from civilisation as ships are reluctant to call with supplies because of the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests conducted in the Pacific area? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, it will be capable of providing support for the Royal Australian Navy and allied units and it would be suitable for the berthing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> powered vessels and the minor servicing of their conventional equipment as distinct from their <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> equipment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As there are signs that peace talks between Russia and the West may at last be tegarded as possible in the not too distant future and in view of the Western response to the latest Soviet peace offensive, particularly  Mr Brezhnev’s  proposal for a 5-power conference on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> disarmament, can the Minister inform the Senate whether arrangements have been made by the parties concerned regarding this very important move? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to say that I donot go along with the criticism that if war broke out and we had a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station, an Omega station or Pine Gap we would immediately become the target of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I want to point cut that if there were a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war and we were involved in it, the presence of the Pine Gap or North West Cape establishments, an Omega station or a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station would not make us the target of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons any more than would Sydney, Newcastle, Whyalla and all the other places of industrial richness and wealth in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As there are signs that peace talks between Russia and the West may at last be regarded as possible in the not too distant future and in view of the Western response to the latest Soviet peace offensive, particularly  Mr Brezhnev’s  proposal for a 5-power conference on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> disarmament, can the Minister inform the Senate whether arrangements have been made by the parties concerned regarding this very important move? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In mid-June, 1971 the Soviet Union advised the other four <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon states - the United States, Britain, France and the People’s Republic of China - that it ‘proposed to convene at the earliest time a conference of the Five Powers possessing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The text of the Soviet Note to the United States spoke of the need for ‘joint actions of all the states possessing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons to arrive at their prohibition and destruction’, progress in which ‘would undoubtedly facilitate the solution of the problem of general and complete disarmament.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Responses from the other four <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon states were as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>President Pompidou of France expressed willingness to join in such a conference, and to commence disarmament, though only if only <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon states did so first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Pending total disarmament, however, it was intended to pursue the French <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Defence Programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 30th July, the People’s Republic of China issued a statement that it would at no time agree to participate in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> disarmament talks which did not include all countries of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It called on the United States and the Soviet Union to issue undertakings, as China had repeatedly done, not to be the first to use <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons, and also to withdraw all <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> arms resources to their own territories as a preliminary gesture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They expressed the view that the proposal would otherwise have merited serious consideration, but that such a conference would require the participation of all five <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> powers to make it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A British Note passed to the Soviet Union in mid-August declared interest in and support for the concept of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> disarmament, but suggested that the Chinese attitude did not make the proposed conference seem practicable at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia, as a party to the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty which prohibits atmospheric testing welcomes the 1st September decision of the French Cabinet to cancel their programme for the remainder of 1971, especially if this leads to their complete discontinuation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The view of the Democratic Labor Party is that we should have in Australia a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> capacity which can be a deterrent to those countries which would attempt by this or any other means to impose their will upon this nation, I think it is a national disgrace that in the light of and in the presence of nations that have developed <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> capacity and have now developed a strike ability to present those war heads in Australia any Australian should advocate that we should be prepared to denude ourselves, at least of the opportunity and the means of deterrents or retaliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 6th October I asked the Minister whether he would make representations to the Minister for National Development concerning the possibility of providing a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station in South Australia, so located as to enable that State to have a major sea water desalination plant and a further source of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At this stage there is no evidence that a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> desalination plant would provide water at a cost delivered to the householder comparable to the figures applying in the case of Australian cities at present and in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With regard to the use of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station in South Australia, the main problem is that at present <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plants are economical only in quite large unit sizes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Already the Japanese have increased their defence vote by 20 per cent and Japan is virtually a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> country already. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As honourable senators may be aware, the Russian Navy today has not only an equality of numbers of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> submarines with the United States but also has in all some 340 orthodox submarines compared with some 85 of the United States as listed in ‘Jane’s Fighting Ships’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has 3 basic types, both <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> and conventional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has also a unique type of long range surfacetosurface air breathing missile to be used mainly against ships but which also could be used with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> warheads against shore installations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the same authority we find that the Russian Navy has not only 95 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> submarines but also has built 10 of these vessels in 1970 and has an estimated capacity of building 30 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> submarines a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that because we believe that the defences of Ibis country should be improved upon we are inviting war from other countries which are armed to the teeth and which arc equipped with the most modern <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To hear some of the remarks which are made about, the naval vessels one would think that we did not live in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we reached such a situation we would be so close to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> conflict that the presence or absence of naval vessels would not really matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If that is so, why is the Royal Australian Air Force carrying out an examination and why is the Department making an evaluation of this system when, in answer to my question yesterday, the Minister said: ‘We do not intend to have a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons capacity in our aircraft’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yesterday, the honourable senator got me into a situation where he was asking me about conventional bombs and he tied this up with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bombs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will recall the arguments which we had a couple of years ago as to whether it was the time and Jervis Bay was the place for the installation of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor and whether the one that was contemplated was the right type. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United States of America maintains its global balance with the Soviet Union and it has a marked superiority in strategic <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> strength vis-a-vis China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is, of course, no part of Australian defence policy to prepare for massive defence by ourselves - whether by conventional or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> means - against an onslaught by one of the great military powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> armoury is already substantial enough to be taken into account by both of the super powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact that Australia is not a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power and has every desire to remain non-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> does not confer upon us some invulnerability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the contrary it confers upon us a need to contribute as a non-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power to the maintenance of the global <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> equilibrium which is sustained by the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To help to prevent a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war is, we believe, consistent with our first and highest national interests, with our alliances - including our obligations under those alliances - and with our international obligations generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to return, however, to the subject of China, whose military inventory contains a good deal more than <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are the foundation for maintaining an effective balance of power in relation to a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> arming China - a consideration of great concern for Australia in the years immediately ahead as will be seen from the description of the subject in the Defence Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Particular attention is given to these elements as they are considered potentially the most hazardous of the radioactive materials relased into the environment from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second programme is directed mainly at the much shorter-lived radioisotopes in fallout (including Iodine 131) which are of significance only in the few months immediately after a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test, and the programme is instituted when it is considered that fallout from a particular test or series of tests may reach Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>3, which I have presented today, concerns the shorter-lived fallout of fresh fission products in Australia from 9th June to 26th November 1971, following <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests by France in Polynesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>France conducted 5 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons tests in the period from 6th June and 15th August 1971 at the test site in the islands of the Tuamotu Archipelago in the South Pacific Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee programme of daily sampling of milk for assay of iodine 131 content in fallout from the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons tests, covered 9 major population centres and included the milk being consumed by about 75 per cent of the total Australian population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that the total radiation doses from fresh fallout over Australia in 1971 were lower than those received foi the 1966 series of French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons tests in Polynesia, and comparable to those for 1968 and 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Prior to the resumption of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons testing by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in September 1961 much of the radioactive debris from earlier tests had been deposited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The levels of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fallout in Australia - both old and new - are very low indeed and do not constitute a hazard to health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s opposition is based on the belief that the partial <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test, ban to which Australia is a party should be universally applied and accepted and ‘oh Australia’s shared concern with the people of the Pacific over the holding qf atmospheric tests in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it also a fact that the Australian Government repeatedly has made it clear within the United Nations and in other world forums that it opposes all forms of atmospheric and underground <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there any evidence of any public protests by the Australian Labor Party against any of the Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am not aware - and I would be obliged to any member of the Opposition who could provide me with such an instance - of any instance when any representative of the Australian Labor Party has voiced opposition to the Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in marked contrast with the noise that was made about the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave - The report of the Atomic Weapons Test Safety Committee on the Biological aspects of the Fallout in Australia from French <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Weapons Explosions in the Pacific, JuneAugust 1971, which was distributed in printed form recently, falls into two parts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main parts of the report is the assessment made by the NRAC of the biological significance of fallout from the 1971 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee is responsible to the Minister for Supply for safety aspects of the use of testing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosive devices in Australia, for evaluation of proposals by other countries to explode <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> devices outside Australia which might give rise to increased levels of radioactivity in the Australian environment arising from activities with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosive devices either in this country or elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since its responsibility is to consider the effects of ionizing radiation, including those which might arise from fallout from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions, the membership of the Committee is biased towards the biological sciences - genetics, public health, experimental pathology, radio-biology - but also includes several physical scientists with particular expertise in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> sciences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National Radiation Advisory Committee has reported in the past on the possible biological consequences of a wide range of sources of ionizing radiation including the medical use of x-rays, the tuberculosis case-finding programmes and radiation control programmes as well as fallout from each French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test series in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its present report the National Radiation Advisory Committee has stated that fallout from the 1971 French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons tests presents no hazard to the Australian population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In part of its evaluation of the hazards to health of the 1971 French tests, the National Radiation Advisory Committee followed a practice, adopted by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, namely that of comparing the radiation doses from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon tests with the doses inevitably received by the community from natural background radiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Appendix to the report of the National Radiation Advisory Committee shows, for example, that the total external radiation dose from fallout deposited on the ground from the 1971 French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests was, when reduction factors due to shielding are applied, in all cases less than 0.7 millirad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs recall his statement yesterday welcoming advice as to any statement made by the Australian Labor Party calling on China to refrain from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he aware that the Federal Executive of the Australian Labor Party on 5th July of this year carried a motion which amongst other things called on all governments to abandon the testing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he is not aware of that motion, will he now concede that the Australian Labor Party does not discriminate in its condemnation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing by any nation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he take note of my statement, on behalf of my Party now, that the Australian Labor Party objects to the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This morning at question time I answered questions by  Senator Wriedt  and  Senator Murphy  concerning the expression by any representative of the Australian Labor Party of its point of view in opposition to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests by Mainland China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy  has since drawn my attention to 3 or 4 such instances in the records of this Parliament and I wish to direct them to the attention of honourable senators in fairness to the Opposition and to withdraw any inference that could be drawn from my remarks that the Opposition had not expressed its disapproval of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests specifically in relation to Mainland China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first instance is recorded in the Senate Hansard of 27th April 1965 in a question headed ‘<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Tests’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The second instance is recorded in the Senate Hansard of 13th May 1966 under the heading ‘Chinese <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Tests’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has made it abundantly clear internationally, in the United Nations, and in its own statements that it adheres to the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> disarmament treaty and is opposed to the proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> armaments and to tests carried out by any country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He had referred to the second Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test which, he said, not only polluted the environment but was also an affront to the possible aspirations of mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the first vote on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> pollution, Australia did not know where to go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that the decisions taken about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> pollution at that Conference were much better than anything decided at the Stockholm Conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When it has come to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> pollution the Government has trodden quietly - softly, softly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1970, I asked the then Minister for Health for certain figures in relation to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fall-out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You sought additional information in relation to your questions on notice Nos 584 and 586 about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fall-out which I had answered earlier that day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 8th August 1972 a statement was issued by the Department of Supply on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fall-out monitoring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are enough scientists in this country alone who say that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fall-out of any sort can have harmful results in the long term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party has said on many occasions that all types of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fall-out are dangerous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The same situation applies to the poisonous waste from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We ought to proceed carefully in this direction also until we are sure that there is no long term danger from the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy for peaceful purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Modern weapons help them; the day will come when suicidal urban terrorists of a kind the world has not yet seen will have a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> device at their disposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the possibility exist that the installation of the Omega navigational system may form part of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> attack system? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Omega installation is a function of the Department of Shipping and Transport and to the best of my knowledge there is no <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> involvement in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister by reminding him, as 1 am sure he will recall, that I asked a question previously seeking information as to whether the National President of the Australian Conservation Foundation had refused to make a public statement condemning possible pollution resulting from the recent series of French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware that the Australian Conservation Foundation made a general statement opposing the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is it a fact that a United Nations scientific committee’s report shows that there has been a significant increase in the level of radioactive iodine in milk in the southern hemisphere since the recent French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To what extent has the radio-iodine level in Australian milk risen since the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true, as the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has said, that recently there have been newspaper reports on the dangers of fall-out of radioactive iodine, iodine 131, following <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is incorrect to say that the United Nations report made any reference to the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests of 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am able to say that the Government has very little knowledge of the French plans for further <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons testing in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we do expect that the French Government will continue with its plans to develop thermo-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> warheads for its missile forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year, the Government has continued actively to oppose atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing in the Pacific, particularly by mobilising international opinion against the French testing programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present, Australia is, with New Zealand and other Pacific countries, acting at the United Nations in New York to prove the extent of international opposition to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons testing, especially in the Pacific area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Wright, I refer to reports from Paris of the possibility that France will resume <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Leader of the Government been drawn to the strengthening opposition to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests not only by Pacific countries but also by people within Australia including members of the trade union movement and others? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator then connects discussions that apparently have been taking place with the French aircraft industry in relation to the future requirements of the RAAF with the question of an alleged increase in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Australian Government received any confirmation of reports which were issued this morning that France intends to resume <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing in the Pacific area later this year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson, do you now wish to respond to  Senator Bishop’s  question in regard to French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government expects the French Government will continue with its plans to develop a thermonuclear warhead for its missile force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These plans could include the atmospheric explosion of a thermonuclear device in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Consideration is already being given by interested departments to the implications for Australia of the explosion of a high yield thermonuclear device in the atmosphere over the Pacific, possibly as early as 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the interest and concern of our Pacific Islands neighbours about the Australian Government’s protest to France about its intention of testing further <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> devices in the Pacific next year, I ask: Has the Government considered the imposition of economic sanctions to prevent these <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests from going ahead, such as warning that it will scrap its plans to purchase Mirage F1 fighters from France? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate which relates to a question asked earlier concerning French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the current protests against the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests, is the Minister aware that the Chinese share with the French a policy of persisting with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there any evidence of harmful levels of radio activity following the last French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, will any protests directed against <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing be directed to both nations using <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test explosions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the National President of the Australian Conservation Foundation refuse to make a public statement condemning the recent series of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in the Pacific Ocean conducted by France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I ask: Is the Government reluctant to impose worthwhile sanctions on French Government as a protest against the declared intention of that Government to conduct further <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing in the Pacific region, because of the fear of French reaction which the Israeli Government experienced in 1967? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that the major source of power generation in South Australia is the brown coal deposits at Leigh Creek and in view of the fact that these deposits have a limited availability, is South Australia not the logical region in which to establish the first <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, is it not equally as logical to site the envisaged uranium enrichment plant in South Australia, based on such a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power provision? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that the South Australian power grid radiates out from Port Augusta - a location which gives ample access to the necessary huge volume of water required for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will these factors be taken into account when the site for a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation and uranium enrichment plant is considered by the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It refers to the possible resumption of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing by the French. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister any definite information as to whether France is likely again to explode a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> device in the Pacific later in the year as reported? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The view is held that it is very probable that France will go ahead with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Government reluctant to impose effectiveness sanctions against the French Government as a protest against that Government’s declared intention to conduct further <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in the Pacific Ocean region because of the fear of an adverse French reaction, similar to that experienced by the Government of Israel in 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If protests are in train, having regard to the Government’s dedicated commitment to open government, can the Minister explain why it was necessary to send a scientific observer in secret to Tahiti to await and observe such <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Oan the Minister explain why no similar protests are being mounted by this Government against the Red Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests at Lop Nor - marginally closer to Australia - which tests, having regard to prevailing wind currents, are far more likely to pollute the Australian atmosphere than the French tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was silence on the Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests part of the price to be paid for our independent foreign policy to secure recognition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wright  referred to the failure of the then Opposition to protest about Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He conceded - perhaps these are my words and not his - that he was quite wrong and that the most definite and heavy protests had been made by members of the Austraiian Labor Party against the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests, the view of the Australian Government on the illegality of the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> atmospheric testing in the Pacific was conveyed to the French Government on 3rd January last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it can be said that a dialogue has been opened up with the French Government on future French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must, however, insist on seeking renegotiation of certain treaties where this is necessary to obviate the complete exclusion of Australia from any effective control over a defence installation on Australian soil or to obviate any possibility that Australia could be involved in war - and a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war at that - without itself having any power of decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essential point I wish to announce tonight is that it has proved possible, through use of these research devices, to monitor the Partial Test Ban Treaty in respect of the testing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons in the atmosphere and on the surface. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The man-made tremors are, of course, made by massive explosions, particuarly by <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> devices underground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The progressive development of this scientific capability to distinguish <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests from natural seismic occurrences is, of course, an essential basis to the development of an effective comprehensive test ban treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They make contributions towards the achievement and monitoring of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> disarmament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have ratified the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Non-Proliferation Treaty and the treaty prohibiting the placement of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons on or under the seabed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the report correct that Canada is supplying Taiwan with a research <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It concerns’ the current radiation content of the Australian atmosphere following past <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests carried out by all nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true also that the amount of radiation has been increased appreciably by the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests’, which have been’ performed in various parts of the world, and also the explosions which took place over Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have said clearly - this is the first time this has been said by any Australian government - that, where such devices, instruments and stations are patently of advantage to the public and the nation because they study underground disturbances and are useful in checking on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions, that information should be made public and members of the Parliament should be allowed to visit the stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each station carries out operations which are beneficial to this country, in that they provide answers to questions about the dangers of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seemed to be freely known that the North West Cape installation was a communications base and that it was concerned, although perhaps not entirely, with communicating with American <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> armed submarines operating in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have argued about the question of the signing of agreements for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> control, and the previous Government had been very reluctant at times to do this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make this point about all these situations: We feel that if we have at least one installation in this country which can monitor <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions it will be very valuable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were saying, in effect: ‘These bases are wrong, these bases are aggressive war installations which would threaten Australia, which would bring a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> holocaust to Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is more, I will tell honourable senators about the amount of fallout as a result of the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What it did not say was that a person can run more risk -I hope that honourable senators from Western Australia are not listening - by making a couple of return flights a month between Canberra and Perth because of the radiation that is absorbed than by absorbing radiation from the fallout of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a weapons system; this is a system of aggression; this is something that will attract <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bombs to Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On one occasion  Senator Carrick  asked  Senator Wright,  whether the Australian Labor Party ever protested about mainland China entering the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had condemned mainland China For testing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Leader of the Government in the Senate advise why a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test carried out in the atmosphere by France is considered to be different from a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test carried out by the People’s Republic of China? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does not the Leader of the Government in the Senate think that the environmental impact caused by Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions wilt, in the long term, be just as harmful to this nation as the environmental damage done by any other nation (“hat explodes <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the testing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons by any country is deplorable, but that is not what the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has asked me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosion in the Northern Hemisphere has a result which perhaps will affect everyone to some extent but has a special effect in the northern hemisphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosion in the southern hemisphere will, because of the rotation of the earth and the special conditions of our planet, have a special effect in the southern hemisphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt whatever that there is a very serious added danger to the countries of the southern hemisphere when a country which is to explode a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> device in the southern hemisphere - and upon the slightest reflection the honourable senators might think this is rather curious - chooses to explode the device as far away as it can get from its own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Government opposed to atmospheric tests of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons as a matter of principle or because of the likely effect on Australia or the region in which we live, without regard to the effect of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions in other countries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has made clear its opposition to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All of the countries of the South Pacific area have expressed concern about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing of any kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say here and now that it is the policy of the Government to oppose <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing by anyone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, opposition has been expressed to every <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy of the Government is to oppose any kind of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing not only because to a greater or lesser degree such tests endanger humanity but alsg because the end result of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing is the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons against the people of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask: Upon the information received from his expert advisers will the AttorneyGeneral confirm the statement made by the Prime Minister yesterday that Australia is not, in the Prime Minister’s words, ‘discernibly affected by <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests by China’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does that mean that the Australian atmosphere is not now and has not been in the past measurably affected by fall-out ‘ from Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>107 that the Australian Government, since coming to office, has not communicated in any way with the People’s Republic of China regarding past or future <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing by that country, why has it not done so? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Government’s opposition to the atmospheric testing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons based on principle? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he agree that many of Australia’s friends are affected by China’s testing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons and deserve support, or is it a case, as suggested in a newspaper editorial, of let them fry with Chou En-Iai? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government is opposed to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has indicated that it will join the relevant conventions which are against the spread of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of Australia’s opposition to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing is one of principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is  the Minister able to say whether this action is possibly premature in the light of other reports that some understanding has been reached between the French and Australian governments that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests will not proceed while the matter of further testing is under discussion between the 2 governments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the AttorneyGeneral, as a result of his recent talks with French Government Ministers, tell the Senate whether, in his opinion, the people of France have been made aware of the intensity of feelings of the Australian people against the proposed atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in the Pacific? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the people of France are not really aware of how much feeling there is in this country, and I think in other countries, against the continuance of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing in the Pacific by the French Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has he been made aware of the widespread approval and appreciation of the people of Australia of his efforts to influence the French Government to abandon its expressed intention of using the Pacific Ocean for the purpose of conducting <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests, to the disadvantage of the inhabitants of the many areas that would thus be adversely affected? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to an earlier question that was directed to him by, I think,  Senator Gietzelt  concerning information which he gave on French television about the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Could you explain to the French people the effects of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing in Australia  1 gave the following answer: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As he has indicated that the French Government was good enough to give him television time to explain the attitude of Australia to French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing, will the Attorney-General direct  Dr Stephen  Fitzgerald, the Australian Ambassador to the People’s Republic of China, immediately to request that Government to give him radio time in China to express Australia’s deep opposition to the continued testing by China of atomic devices? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the matter of communicating to the People’s Republic of China the views of the Australian Government on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing, my understanding is that this has been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that in the last few weeks the Australian Government has sent to the Chinese Government its protest against China’s <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have done it myself, we have scientists who are doing it, and there is a swell of opinion right round the world against <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing, and we make no discrimination whatever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister produce a clear statement for the people of Australia setting out the specific hazards of the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests as alleged by the Government and indicating also, to obtain perspective, the nature, degree and sources of other man-made radiation including aircraft flights, X-ray and  sunbaking? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although the Opposition when in government did give some sort of approval in principle to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Weapons, it never ratified that Treaty because it wanted to leave the back door open in case it should be necessary at any stage to stockpile <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> deterrents of some form or other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that so far as <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in the Pacific are concerned there has been great danger to residents in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In August 1967 I raised publicly, for the first time so far as I know the question of the amount of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fallout on Australia and quoted figures for various areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the essential difference in the assessment of the biological effects of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosion fallout from the reports of the National Radiation Advisory Committee up until June 1972 and of the Council of the Australian Academy of Science? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it correct to assume that the present Australian Government’s attitude is that any ill effects whatever, however small, from the proposed <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in the Pacific are totally undesirable? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the AttorneyGeneral: Is it not a fact that radioactive fallout from a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosion in China is just as potent to the world’s atmosphere as one in the Pacific? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>relation to the Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of the Australian people is clearly in opposition to these <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests, particularly to atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests anywhere and especially to those which are being conducted in our own hemisphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator may know that Australia is in dispute with France over the proposed continuance of atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing by that country ‘in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, one of the very distinguished Japanese journalists who was in Hanoi at the same time as I was there described the bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong as a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> attack without <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons because- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report by the National Radiation Advisory Committee - NRAC - deals, as the title implies, solely with the effects on Australians of the testing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons by France during June and July 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In February 1973, the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  requested the Australian Academy of Science to report to him on the actual or potential harm to Australia, including its human and animal population, its resources and environment, from the explosion of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> devices in the atmosphere, under water, or on or near the surface of the earth, with particular regard to the past and prospective explosions by France in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reports of the NRAC and the Academy establish that the people of Australia may have been adversely affected by France holding <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons tests in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, we are preparing to initiate proceedings against France in the International Court of Justice with a view to restraining France from continuing the testing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons in the atmosphere of the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has also taken steps to review and rationalise the means by which it is provided with information on the effects of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fallout on the Australian population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer here to the report by Messrs Rathgerber, Gibbs and Stevens which deals with the safety regime operating at the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test site in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the principal conclusions of the Australian Academy of Science on the biological effects of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fallout include the emphasis that there should be no unwarranted exposure to radiation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the reference in the National Radiation Advisory Committee report which stresses that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in either the northern or southern hemisphere could harm Australia, I ask: Has the Government been provided with any information from official sources in China with respect to the degree and measurement of fallout resulting from Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he is not now in possession of the facts, will the Minister take early action to inform the Senate in respect of the possibility of a naval supply vessel being sent to the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosion test area? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister Assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs been drawn to a radio news item attributed to the Australian Ambassador to China in which he was reported to have said that he did not think a continuance of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests by that country would interfere with the improved relations with China? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, how does the Minister reconcile this with the Government’s attitude to the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in our protest to China and, indeed, to any other country that is exploding <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> devices in the atmosphere, we can get our point over and have some influence without harming relationships, that is precisely what we will be doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of preface I indicate that I heard on radio today that  Dr Fitzgerald  had commented that an approach had been made by the Labor Government to the Peoples Republic of China in relation to its testing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> devices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now ask: Will the Government advise the Government of the Peoples Republic of China that this Government will support the unions in this country in their threat to halt all communications and trade relations with China unless she immediately stops <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing in the atmosphere? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government advise China, as a Minister of this Government advised France, that it will consider breaking diplomatic relations with China unless it halts <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In saying that I am not necessarily advocating the rearmament of Japan or the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> equipping of Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorneygeneral tabled documents which show the projected statistics in relation to mutative or genetic variations which are likely from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fallout. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could table more horrific documents from scientists which suggest that the drugs -which are taken in a mass way will create greater genetic changes than all the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fallouts that we get from arms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Modern weapons help them; the day will come when suicidal urban terrorists of a kind the world has not yet seen will have a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> device at their disposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is directed to the Attorney-General, relates to the current approach by the Australian Government to the International Court of Justice at The Hague concerning the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would be inclined to think that since  Senator Murphy  had approached France on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests and come back with the answer that he did, he would be prepared to let other than the Attorney-General of this country, who is a member of a House which is so particularly busy, as he says, go overseas for these 10 days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all the honourable senator said that  Senator Murphy  asked for deferment of this matter now sought to be raised by  Senator Gair,  and of which  Senator Gair  gave notice only yesterday afternoon, for a period of 10 days until  Senator Murphy  returns from The Hague where he will represent Australia at the International Court of Justice to put Australia’s case against France’s desire to carry out <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> experiments in the Pacific Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am inclined to think that an attempt is being made to discredit Australia’s representative who is to present the case for the Australian people before the International Court of Justice against the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests which will be held in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He even had the temerity to say that the alleged violation of the civil liberties of a few Croatians in Canberra was more important than the deaths that may occur from the explosion of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> devices in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I can get on to this question - I hope I am appealing to the responsible members of the Opposition - I point out that we have to consider in this question whether we should seek to set up a committee for the purpose of attempting to discredit our representative who will appear before the International Court of Justice simply because some honourable senators do not think that the deaths that may occur as a result of the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosion in the Pacific are as important as the privacy of some Croatians which may have been invaded by the raid by Commonwealth police, on their homes on that particular night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It concerns the subject of man-made <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fallout and relates to the tabled reports of the National Radiation Advisory Committee, the Academy of Science and the Atomic Weapons Testing Committee and specifically to certain information which I have sought to obtain, very unsuccessfully, from the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Attorney-General agree that he and the Australian Government have possibly made a very grave error of judgment in that he has got the Government to agree that Australia should make an approach to the International Court of Justice at The Hague concerning <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing when, on his own admission, the Attorney-General - the chief law officer of Australia - is unable to say whether the Government accepts the jurisdiction of the Court, whether it will be bound by the Court’s decision and whether it accepts the other aspects which were put to the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the questions repeatedly asked of him by  Senator Carrick  and the question asked of him by  Senator Marriott  about French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following his recent appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague against the proposed French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in the Pacific, will he be making a similar appeal to the International Court of Justice against the proposed Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Government aware of the facts contained in the report of the Atomic Weapons Test Safety Committee which was tabled by  Senator Murphy  last week and which refers to fallout over Australia from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons tested by the French in Polynesia during June and July 1972? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me just add that I noticed that the leader of the honourable senator’s Party- yesterday, I think - made ‘ a strong statement, presumably on behalf of his Party,, relating to the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests.- The action of the Australian Government in initiating proceedings is being taken on behalf of the whole nation and the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Both sides are joined in opposition to the conduct of the French atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Australian Government made any protest to the Chinese Government about that country’s <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> atmospheric testing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, should the statement referred to by  Senator Carrick  that China intends proceeding with a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing program prove to be correct, will the Australian Government take this matter to the International Court of Justice with the object of preventing these tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Prime Minister able to confirm that Australia is not ‘discernibly affected by <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests by China’, which claim was made by him in a statement of 13th March 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the statement mean that the Australian atmosphere is not, and has not been, measurably affected by fall-out from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests conducted by the People’s Republic of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>and (2) Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests are conducted in the Northern Hemisphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of this slowly transfers to the southern half of the statosphere and mixes with similar material already present there from other <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On5th April 1973 in answer to a question without notice from the honourable member for Warringah, I said that: ‘In general terms, the effect of the Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests is only one-tenth as great in Australia as the effect of the French tests at Mururoa’ (see House of Representatives Hansard, page 1121). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have protested to the Chinese Government against its failure to accede to the partial <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test ban treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the, total trade and communications bans imposed on France by the Australian Council of Trade Unions because of the proposed <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in the Pacific, does the Minister expect that the trade unions will impose similar bans when a further <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test date is announced by China, which is reported to be currently negotiating new trade agreements with Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The subject of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests is largely one related to foreign affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which relates to the intention of the People’s Republic of China and of France to continue atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing, is directed to the Minister assisting the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The long and involved question asked by the honourable senator concerns trade and arises out of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests being conducted at the moment, mainly by France but possibly in the future by China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Acting Leader of the Government been drawn to this morning’s Press report that the Australian case against French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing being heard at ‘the Hague may take up to 12 months to be heard? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It refers to the request which Australia has made to Great Britain to support it in its protests against the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it obviously must be very embarrassing for the British and Australian governments, which collaborated in a long series of tests and got all the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> information that they wanted, to suggest that France should stop after having gone only part of the way in its investigations, would it not be a much better alternative for Australia to ask the Government of Great Britain to make available to France the full information which it has obtained with our assistance and so make it unnecessary for France to conduct further tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having indicated that I oppose French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing if health dangers are involved, I ask: Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to an article by  Sir Philip  in this morning’s ‘Sydney Morning Herald’ which states inter alia that any person who moves his home from Sydney to Canberra is deliberately subjecting himself and his family to a permanently increased radiation dose very similar to that from the French tests because Canberra is 1,900 feet above sea level? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it true that the Democratic Labor Party actually wants Australia to develop its own <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> capacity but that the Australian Government is totally opposed to the proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Snedden  and, I think,  Mr Anthony  have complained to France about its <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia is opposed to the proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the representative of the Minister for Foreign Affairs has apparently not been advised on the policy of the Australian Democratic Labor Party regarding <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions, will the Minister take notice that the Democratic Labor Party has repeatedly said that its policy is for complete <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> disarmament all over the world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our policy further states that when countries such as the Soviet Union and China refuse to take action to end <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> armaments in the world Australia then has no alternative but to endeavour to obtain a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> deterrent for herself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Democratic Labor Party believes that we ought to have a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> deterrent in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator McManus  added ‘while some other countries’ - and he named 2 of them - have <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> armaments’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To that extent the Democratic Labor Party agrees with the Australian Labor Party that we would not want to see a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> deterrent in any country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where we part company from the Democratic Labor Party is that we do not think that by proliferating <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons in the world we get to the point of disarmament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude always seems strange to me that if one wants disarmament in the world, particularly in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> area, the way to achieve this is by building more bombs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What was said was that planning was proceeding for the Royal Australian Navy to provide a float support for the Royal New Zealand Navy frigate should it be deployed to the vicinity of the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test area at Mururoa Atoll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is intended that the ship will operate clear of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fallout area, and questions of danger and contamination do not arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was the Minister for Overseas Trade,  Dr Cairns,  indicating Labor Government policy in his reported statement to the effect that China as a world power had justification for having a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> deterrent weapons system but that France was only pursuing Gaullist ambitions in seeking to do so? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>ls it not a fact that both these Committees gave scientific advice to the Government in respect of French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing which did not fit in with the Government’s political tenets? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable senators 1 present the report of the meeting between Australian and French scientists on 7, 8 and 9 May at the Australian Academy of Science in Canberra on biological effects of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosion fallout. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Special Minister of State, refers to a previous question asked by me seeking possible dates and locations of the next series of Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests and the Minister’s written reply, for which I am grateful, specifically the following portion of it which reads: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since it is imperative that the world should have forwarning of such tests which, on the Minister’s answer, could take place tomorrow without the Australian Government’s knowledge, what steps has the Government taken to ascertain the likely future program of Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Carrick  knows - my letter to him described the situation - we have protested to the Chinese about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in the atmosphere in accordance with our consistant attitude in relation to any tests in the atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With  Senator Murphy  presenting a case to the International Court of Justice in The Hague on French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests and the rights and protection of humanity, can the Minister say whether the AttorneyGeneral will be returning home via Yugoslavia in order to have discussions with the heads of Government in that country on the rights and protection of Australian citizens in Yugoslavia and, further, to ascertain whether any Australians are being held in custody there? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be developing very quickly our ability to produce atomic or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy, and certainly in this regard we should be looking to those far : outlying areas of Australia where it will be enormously expensive to take fuel energy by means of a national grid pipeline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I examine it against the background in which the world faces a growing shortage of fossil fuels and is now seeking alternatives in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy, solar energy and other alternatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when from this current Government we have an ignoring of the Commission, a split-up and a breakdown of the Department of National Development and the emergence, without any research background, of a pipeline authority one wonders what is happening to the proposal for the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe in 20 years time <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power will meet the greater part of our energy needs and the immense cost which has been faced in establishing a pipeline authority will be seen as so much money wasted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That in the opinion of the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly the testing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> devices in the atmosphere is to be deplored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Parliament of the State of Tasmania records its support for moves by the Federal Government to prevent the planned <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests by the French Government in the South Pacific area and to refer this important matter to the International Court of Justice at the Hague. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps I might take this opportunity of publicly acknowledging the debt that the Commonwealth Government owes to the initiative of the Attorney-General of Tasmania - of which both the previous and present Ministers for Foreign Affairs were aware at the time - in seeking advice from Professor O’Connell of the University of Adelaide, now the Chichele Professor of International Law at Oxford, on the prospects of this avenue before the World Court of restraining the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of these great objectives - sensible relations with China, the limitation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons and the end of foreign intervention in Indo-China - have yet been brought to ultimate fruition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the relaxation of tension which I have mentioned, suspicion and conflict of interests between the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons states persist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through the United Nations and other international machinery we have the opportunity to press for the removal of barriers and constraints against a less hostile and more fruitful development of relations between the major <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> states. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The most disturbing matter presently troubling the South Pacific is the continuation of French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is party to the Partial <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Test Ban Treaty, the NonProliferation Treaty and the Sea Bed Arms Control Treaty, and supports the conclusion of an effective and comprehensive <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons test ban treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are opposed to all forms of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons testing by whatever nation and our objective is the suspension of all such testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have registered with the Chinese Government Australia’s opposition to its <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons testing in the atmosphere and are pursuing with the utmost vigor an international legal and political campaign to induce France to abandon its testing program in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The World Health Assembly in Geneva has just adopted by a vote of 87 to 4, with 10 abstentions, a resolution deploring all <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing which results in an increase in the level of ionizing radiation in the atmosphere and urging its immediate cessation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the feelings of public outrage throughout the Pacific region and bipartisan parliamentary condemnation in Australia of French plans to proceed with its <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons tests, the Government has acted dispassionately and with considerable restraint, because of the great value it attaches to its wider relations with France, by exploring all possible avenues in seeking a solution to this disagreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States Air Force detachment at Amberley and the joint Geological and Geophysical Research Station at Alice Springs collectively possess technical facilities to monitor the testing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> devices in the atmosphere, on the surface and underground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the reported intention of mainland China to continue with a program of atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in spite of objections raised by the Minister for Overseas Trade during his recent visit to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I can say is that the Government is opposed to the carrying out of atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests by any country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of course a fact that both China and France have <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has made clear its policy of consistent opposition to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons testing in the atmosphere, by both France and China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact is that we have an outstanding disagreement with France at the moment concerning French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister agree that this may indicate that a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosion could take place tomorrow? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware of the precise information which the honourable senator has just given to me, but he will be aware, as all of us are, that Australia took a case to the International Court of Justice in regard to the proposed French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests and that that Court is still deliberating upon Australia’s application for interim measures to prevent the French for continuing with any tests in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The French officials have in their Part ‘B’ sought to demonstrate that French atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon tests in the Pacific are without hazard by invoking dose limits recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (the ICRP), by arguing that the radiation doses from those tests are small compared with those from other man-made sources of ionizing radiation and by comparing those doses with those inevitably received by populations from natural background radiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary to bear in mind that ICRP draws a distinction between controllable sources of radiation (such as planned releases of radioactive substances from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power reactors) and uncontrollable sources (such as radio-active debris from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ICRP identified <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon explosions as an uncontrollable source of radiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>French officials compare the radiation doses from French atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in the Pacific with the dose limits recommended by ICRP which the French wrongly suggested were for the total population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ionizing radiation from French atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in the Pacific is an uncontrolled source. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By seeking to apply, for the total Australian population with respect to its atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests, the dose limits recommended by ICRP for critical groups of the public, France usurps the absolute right of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The French Government has argued that the radiation doses to the Australian population and to other populations from its <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon testing in the atmosphere, are but small fractions of hte annual natural background doses and, indeed, that the radiation doses from the radio-active fall-out from those tests are embraced by the variations which occur in natural background doses even within a large city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It further involves all past <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon tests, including those carried out by France in the atmosphere in the Pacific Ocean, and in particular further <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon tests which Australia has reason to believe France proposes to carry out in the atmosphere at its Pacific test centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let the Senate be quite clear that the Australian Government is opposed to any kind of atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ultimately it is clear that the continuence of atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing by nations of the world, including France and China, will affect the people of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that if <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing is allowed to continue it will not stop at the 2 nations which have been mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So irrespective of what nation is involved the Australian Government is taking the stand of objecting to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to precisely what steps ought to be taken, firstly, these would depend on what may be said by the International Court of Justice on the whole question of atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing; and secondly, the steps actually to be taken are matters of policy for the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister cause an inquiry to be conducted in northern Queensland, which is affected by heavy fallout from French bomb tests, in order to ascertain whether the increase in leukemia is widespread in the area and if it has been brought about by <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fallout? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Investigations are now going on all over the world into the results of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests because apart from the general question of radiation we are dealing with substances which have not hitherto existed on earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The elements in question are peculiarly the result of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing and it seems that more and more is becoming known about the dangers of these and their effect upon the environment generally and the human body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to such political strikes as the one going on presently concerning the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the approach by the Australian Government to the International Court of Justice at The Hague, concerning French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests, the first legal approach to that body by any Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When was the protest of the Australian Government made to the Government of the People’s Republic of China concerning that country’s <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since it is possible that the People’s Republic of China might explode a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> device at any time, is the matter not equally as urgent as the French tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall, strontium 90 and caesium 137 fall-out from French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests is currently giving rise to 5 to 6 times as much radiation to the Australian population as that from Chinese tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 29 May  Senator Withers  asked me a question relating to Naval personnel who do not wish to sail in HMAS Sydney’ to take part in the protest against the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 22 of these cases the granting of leave is in no way connected with the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests and would be normal for any unexpected deployment of a ship (14 are for compassionate reasons and  8  for family financial reasons). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It relates to the recent Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> blast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister agree with the statement made in Ottawa by the Prime Minister in which he seemed to excuse China for conducting <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests but said that the French action was monstrous? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not a case of sheer hypocrisy to accept trade delegations from one <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing country and enter into trading agreements with it and at the same time to threaten to sever all relations with the other country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that the Mayor of Auckland refused to welcome the Chinese trade delegation officially because, as he publicly stated, he placed the Chinese in the same category as the French in regard to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government, and for many years the Australian Labor Party when it was in Opposition expressed opposition to the conduct of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing, especially in the atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of the Australian Government in opposing the conduct of such atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests has been consistent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not prepared to accept the honourable senator’s suggestion that either the Prime Minister in Ottawa or the Australian Government in any respect whatever has failed to indicate at all times objection to such atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests by any power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know, because we were told in the way that the Prime Minister passes on information to this nation, that the reason why he was going to Mexico was to enlist the support of the Mexican Government for the now notorious Australian attitude of condemnation of the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there has not been a word in condemnation of the Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the Prime Minister was not able to achieve in Mexico that which he set out to achieve, namely, a condemnation not of the French and the Chinese but simply of the French alone for their <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that the reason why protests were made against the Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing was because pressure was being brought to bear by the Opposition upon the Australian Government because of its being totally selective in the way in which it was approaching this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an inconsistent attitude if, as  Senator Willesee  would have the people of Australia believe, the Government’s attitude to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing is the same irrespective of whether it is carried out by France or China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this same vaudeville television performance  Mr Whitlam  said that he was referring to  Mr Heath  in those terms only in regard to the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I imagine that it was the same attitude as was found by the Prime Minister when he went to Mexico, and as he finds when he goes to many countries, namely, that if you are objecting to atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing - that is a sound and proper basis for all persons thinking of the future of mankind in this world to have as the ground of their objection - you do not single out one country and ignore another in the type of objection you are making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That communique shows that significant advances in a great number of areas were made at that meeting and it contains a statement on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ministry for Foreign Affairs, under his guidance, was represented at the World Health Organisation and elsewhere, and one knows that Australia has taken one of the strongest stances in the world against the conduct of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing by any country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wright  made the same kind of wrong statements that have been made here tonight about the Labor Party not protesting against the Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said: ‘Members of the Labor Party condemn <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in general terms and they condemn what the French are doing in specific terms, but they never specifically condemned the Chinese tests*. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I concede that he was gracious and decent enough to concede that he was in error and that we had repeatedly dealt with the Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests and had specifically done so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw your attention to the fact that throughout that paper there is reference to the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests, that the Court of Justice had reached a decision and to the attitude of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went to the Commonwealth Prime Ministers Conference in Ottawa to get the Conference specifically to condemn French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests, and he failed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>(2) (3) and (4) The actions of Australian citizens and organisations have to be understood in the light of the situation that has been created by the carrying out by the French Government of atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in open disregard of a ruling of the world’s highest judicial tribunal, the International Court of Justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that  Dr Cairns  on behalf of the Government recently signed a trade agreement accompanied by expressions of eternal friendship with China - a country which recently exploded a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bomb which affected 7 times more people than the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests did? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the other matter of protests about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing, it has been said again and again in this chamber and outside of it that the Government is resolutely opposed to the conducting of atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing and, for that matter, to any kind of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing by any country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ability of the 2 super powers, the Soviet Union and the United States, to destroy each other by <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> exchange has placed substantial restraint on direct military confrontation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Leader of the Government in the Senate offer any explanation as to the contention of the Prime Minister in a recent statement to the effect that French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions in the Pacific were a monstrous proposition; also that China was in danger of attack, and France was not? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Were these contentions used merely to cover up the strangely ambiguous attitude by which a threat was made to sever diplomatic relations with France but China, which persists in exploding <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bombs in proximity to the world’s greatest centre of population, is treated by the Government with honour, its emissaries are received in this country and trade agreements are entered into with them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s attitude has been consistent in opposition to atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing by any country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Government seems to believe that one of the virtues of the Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests is that the tests have been conducted over Chinese territory, I ask the Minister: Does the Chinese Government consider the effect of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fall-out to be of little significance, or does the Chinese Government display a callous disregard for the health and welfare of its people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see no virtues in any country conducting <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests, and we have made that abundantly clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Murphy  himself in this place has attacked <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our consistent attitude has been that it is not only a question of the pollution of the area of fall-out but also a question involving the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> NonProliferation Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the Senate deplores the Government’s double standards in respect of atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing by China and France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me make it clear at the outset that the Opposition condemns all atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing wherever it is conducted and by whomever it is conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The former Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Honourable Nigel Bowen, led in the United Nations the condemnation of atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We charge the Government with double standards in relation to French and Chinese atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that no member of the Government either in this House or in the other place has ever asked a question which is critical of China in regard to atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has taken us many months to try to establish - we still have not established it because of the conflicting statements made  by  the Prime Minister and by  Senator Murphy  - whether the Government’s attitude to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing was based on principle or on humanitarian grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have asked  Senator Murphy  on several occasions whether the Government’s attitude to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing in the asmosphere was based on principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of Australia’s opposition to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing is one of principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 13 March he was asked a question in relation to French and Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests and he replied: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have you had any response from the Chinese Government on your protest note on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has taken great pride, and has repeatedly expressed its pride, in mobilising world opinion against French atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government advise the Government of the Peoples Republic of China that this Government will support the unions in this country in their threat to halt all communications and trade relations with China unless she immediately stops <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing in the atmosphere? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government advise China, as a Minister of this Government advised France, that it will consider breaking diplomatic relations with China unless it halts <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The French testing has been done mainly with a trigger device and not with an actual <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>En-lai become somewhat angry and replied very angrily to  Dr Cairns  and made it quite clear that China was going to continue <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing whether we liked it or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest the answer is that they would not have received the delegation because the Australian Government had protested against French atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is noteworthy also that at one stage  Dr Cairns,  apparently in a more frank moment, said that he would support a ban on trade with China if it exploded a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went to Mexico to seek from the Mexican Government support for the condemnation of French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no word from the Prime Minister of the Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam therefore went into talks knowing, for example, that the Mexicans would not be prepared specifically to denounce France for its recent <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests, but that it would be prepared to denounce all tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report started off by saying that  Mr Whitlam  had said that France’s <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test program was more monstrous than China’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam is expected to seek joint action by other Commonwealth countries to condemn the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has said that the Government condemns all <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests as a matter of principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does that excuse them from exploding <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bombs without considering the health and welfare of millions of people in the world once the fall-out goes obliquely over Japan and Korea? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He made a reported statement in which he said that he was remaining in  Australia  for some weeks to display to the French Australia’s strong protest against the French atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it were dinkum, sincere and honest in its condemnation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests then it would take the same action against any country that exploded <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons in the atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would seem from newspaper reports that the Soviet Government may be about to take punitive action against the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> scientist Andrei Sakharov only on the ground that he applied to emigrate to Israel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No matter what the bleatings from the Opposition might be, when it came to the question of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions, as  Senator Murphy  pointed out, we have been critical of any of the super powers which have indulged in this <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> madness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not incredible that a nation which can launch satellites, cosmonauts, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> submarines and intercontinental ballistic missiles is utterly unable to devise a social system which will allow its people to live in freedom and dignity? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Is the Minister aware of recent statements by  Dr Linus  Pauling and other scientists that compulsory chest x-ray programs will cause the Australian population to be exposed to radiation comparable to that arising from the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-9">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Radiation doses from chest x-ray surveys and those arising from the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests are not strictly comparable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Is the Prime Minister aware that on 10 August 1973, the Deputy Prime Minister announced that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fall-out detected at Laverton was from the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Prime Minister agree that as the French merely detonated <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> trigger devices, whereas the Chinese detonated a full-scale bomb, such fall-out is more likely to be of Chinese origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The actions of Australian citizens or organisations in protesting against the carrying out by the French Government of atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests in the Pacific have to be understood in the light of the open disregard by France of the ruling of the International Court of Justice and the relative effects on the Australian environment of fall-out from French and Chinese tests (see the answer given in the Senate on IS May 1973 to Question No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether China is testing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons or France is testing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons is only a superficial argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Parliament of Australia should be doing on behalf of everyone in this country is taking a united stand to denigrate and to ostracise any country that tests a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> device. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my mind the double standards of the Government in respect of atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing by China and France are indicative of its standards in everything it does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People who listened to  Senator O  ‘Byrne’s speech would know that he does not even realise that China has exploded atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As was mentioned by  Senator Carrick,  I trunk, our Foreign Minister,  Mr N.  H. Bowen, moved in the United Nations for the banning of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me get back to what the Prime Minister says when he wants to justify Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I am concerned we have to see that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing is stopped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also have to try to break down the build-up of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons and we have to endeavour to try to promote peace throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do not want <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fall-out around the world- we have no proof whether it will be dangerous, but let us assume that perhaps it could be dangerous- let us stop <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fallout or radiation where it is possible to stop it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that this Government is prepared to do everything possible to frustrate France while at the same time it does absolutely nothing to oppose <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing by China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Atmospheric <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Tests by China and France: Adjourned debate … on the motion by  Senator Sim-  that the Senate deplores the Government’s double standards in respect of atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing by China and France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say quite unequivocally that this matter was put on the notice paper by Sentor Sim as a smokescreen for the retention of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> armaments throughout the world and not as a protest against the alleged double standards by the Government or anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Government used all the dodges that it could use to conceal from the Australian public the fact that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fallout was in heavy concentration over this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the time the Australian Democratic Labor Party was advocating a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> deterrent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party, fearful of offending the Democratic Labor Party, thought that perhaps a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> deterrent would not be a bad idea and facilities were made available to people who wanted to test and train in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any nation must stand condemned for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions, whether they be in the atmosphere or underground, and for the operation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations where the waste cannot be disposed of safely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a moral responsibility on everybody in all of the parliaments in this country to see that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons are not brought into Australia and that facilities for the explosion of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons are not made available anywhere near Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In April of this year the Australian Academy of Science prepared for the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  a report setting out the biological effects of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosion fallout. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explosion of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons in the atmosphere releases material (fall-out) which is radioactive- that is it emits ionizing radiation which effects living organisms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this section assessments are made of the radiation doses to humans in Australia, arising from the testing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons at the French test site in the South Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Outside the local fall-out area, most evidence suggests that only a few  of  the radioactive elements produced by a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosion are a serious hazard to human health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These elements comprise the short lived fission products notably iodine- 131; the long lived fission products strontium-90 and caesium- 137; and carbon- 14, which is produced in quantity by thermonuclear explosions(1) . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The radiation doses due to short lived fission products from past French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons tests may be estimated directly from observations made in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Table 1 (Appendix, section 2) shows the average thyroid doses to young children in various localities which resulted from the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons tests in the years indicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Table 2 (Appendix, section 2) shows the ‘unshielded’ doses due to external irradiation by short lived fission products in various localities and in each year in which <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons test occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The radiation levels observed in Australia at a particular time therefore contain contributions from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons tests in earlier years, including those which occurred in the northern hemisphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions to date have added comparatively little carbon-14 to the human environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The dose rate to human tissue due to carbon-14 from all <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions which have occurred is in any case rather small, roughly 0.5 millirad per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A reasonable allowance for the dose commitment due to French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests, taking into account only doses delivered up to the year 2000 (Appendix, section 3 ) is: 0.2 millirad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the following table, the above estimated dose commitments, in millirad, due to past French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons test, are collected together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That would be news to a lot of people-  and will continue to advocate, measures which would, under international supervision, assure a ban on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> arms and their manufacture as well as the destruction of existing stockpiles, France is pursuing her policy of defence; given the present state of world armaments, the development of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> armament is essential for French security and independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A very small number of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scientific evidence given to the International Court of Justice was sufficient to prove, in my view, even if it has not convinced  Senator Hannan,  that there is a possible danger from all <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions wherever they may occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I said earlier in my contribution to this debate that every country which conducts <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions of any sort stands condemned in the eyes of the free people of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only people who consistently opposed resolutions on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> devices of any sort were the people of France, although a couple of other countries abstained from voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of the Conference under the heading ‘<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Weapon Testing and Radioactive Wastes ‘ stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this subject, the Conference expressed the following three major concerns: the need to cease immediately all <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons tests in the atmosphere; the need to obtain as soon as possible a comprehensive test ban; and, the need to find a satisfactory solution to the problem of storing radio-active wastes before developing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fission energy plants on a large scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An immediate ban on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons tests in the atmosphere was considered imperative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the third concern, the disposal of wastes from fission <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy plants, a member argued that such plants were intended to avoid many of the environmental problems caused by the exploitation and use of traditional energy sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason, he disagreed with the warning contained in the final paragraph of the resolution against the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fission energy plants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This statement was disputed by several other speakers who insisted that, as stated in the original resolution, development on a large scale of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fission energy plants should not continue until the storage problem had been solved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Convinced that, on the evidence available, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons tests in the atmosphere are a dangerous source of pollution; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Convinced that available evidence does not support the contention that underground <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons testing is free from the possibility of radio-active pollution; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The campaign of the present Government has been a much more positive one and the very production of the White Paper to which I have referred indicates that the French Government is conscience stricken about exploding its <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> devices so close to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I again refer to the fact that in the days of the early French tests the then Government of this country with its feeble voice of protest made no real attempt to stop the explosion of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> devices within wind range of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said a few moments ago, anybody who tests <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons and anybody who uses <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> powered powerhousesunless there is a safe way to dispose of the wasteis doing damage to mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the previous Government wanted to set up a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power house in this country it arranged to bury the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste in north Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The policy of the DLP is that we support world <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> disarmament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have supported every move which has been made at the United Nations and elsewhere to achieve world <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> disarmament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the world in which we live it has not been possible so far to obtain world <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> disarmament because of the refusal of the communist countries- particularly the Soviet Union- to agree to a system of inspection which would make any system of world <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> disarmament trustworthy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the circumstances we say that, as it is not possible because of this refusal to co-operate by certain nations which are already armed with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons, it is necessary that other countries in their own interestsand Australia- should endeavour to obtain a deterrent which is the only method of defence against <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> attack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances we came to the conclusion that the only defence against <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> attack was the ability to reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the recent <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> disarmament treaty was under consideration a number of countries refused to be associated with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody would describe her as a person who believed in war and in the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bombs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But  Mrs Ghandi  refused to allow India to accede to the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Non-Proliferation Treaty because she said that under that Treaty the nations which already possessed <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> arms would be safeguarded and there would be no guarantee of safeguards for other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment India, on her border, has 2 powerful neighbours with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> arms- the Soviet Union and China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can understand the attitude of  Mrs Ghandi  who, at the United Nations through her representatives, said frankly that she would sign the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> NonProliferation Treaty if the nations which had <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> arms- great nations like Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union- would guarantee to defend, if necessary with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons, any country such as India or Australia which might be attacked by a country having <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> arms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nations which have backed the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Non-Proliferation Treaty have made it clear that if a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war broke out and they were attacked they would use their <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons as a deterrent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would have the utmost sympathy for Australia, France or India, but they would not guarantee that they would under any circumstance necessarily use the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bomb to protect those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why countries such as France and India refuse to be associated with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> disarmament as propounded by the great nations which already have the bomb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We of the Australian Democratic Labor Party, like the  President  of India,  Mrs Ghandi,  and the rulers of other countries, believe that everything possible should be done to achieve world <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> disarmament, but in the event of certain powers refusing to guarantee the protection of countries which are not <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> armed, we believe that Australia should seek, preferably from her allies, guarantees of protection which include, if necessary, the provision of the bomb as a deterrent for our own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s indignation over <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing has been somewhat belated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The French say they have no particular desire to spend their money upon <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions and that they have no particular desire to busy themselves with preparing for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have examined the situation in Europe today and have come to the conclusion that because the Soviet Union has the bomb, Great Britain has the bomb and the United States has the bomb and because they have had no guarantees from any of those countries that they will be protected or defended against <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> attack, they have to defend themselves from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> attack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The French people consider that the United States cannot be relied upon to continue to provide the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> umbrella that it provides at present in Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the situation in Europe and as no other country in Europe has the military power to stand up to the Soviet Union, the French have decided that their only hope, faced with the possibility of an American withdrawal from Europe, is if they have a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> deterrent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The French are not proposing to arm themselves from a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> point of view to the same degree as the Russians or the Americans because that would be beyond their power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The French believe that in order to ensure their own independence it is necessary for them to be able to protect themselves to some degree in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The French, British and Chinese have all done the same thing in a world in which the large nations which have <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons at their disposal will not promise to protect anybody else who is attacked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have said that they will develop their own <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons for their own protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point that has to be taken into consideration is that although the indignation has been focused upon them the French are not actually proposing to arm themselves with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons to anything like the degree that the major powers have <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> armed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Professor Burns points out further that the only power that would be immediately disadvantaged by France’s development of an efficient thermo-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> warhead is the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He says that is why we hear what we do against the French tests from Moscow orientated Communist Union leaders who were silent when in 1961 the Soviet broke the unofficial mon.torium on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests with a 50 megaton explosion and later on with at least an 80 megaton explosion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next thing I want to point out- Professor Burns mentioned it- is that the French propose to obtain <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> armaments to an infinitely lower degree than the major powers which already possess them and in regard to which there appears to be no criticism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The French say that they are developing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons only because the major powers refuse to guarantee protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mrs Ghandi,  the Prime Minister of India, has stated that there is no argument against a nation seeking <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> arms when major powers will not protect her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Premier Chou En-lai said that he believed that France, like China, had to have <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> armaments because of the threat from the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also said that China would continue to conduct these <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prime Minister, can you elaborate on the statement you made in Parliament this afternoon that there were reasons why Australia could not consider an approach to the International Court on Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the winds from the Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing don’t come within thousands of miles of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I merely ask any fair-minded senator: Do you consider that it is an argument against Australia’s taking action against China that the winds will blow the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fallout over Asian people and not over Australian people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the winds from the Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing don’t come within thousands of miles of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the attitude of the Government is that it does not mind or that it is OK if Asians are threatened with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fallout but it is not OK if Australians are so threatened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you want to show indignation against <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests, then it should be a great deal higher against the Chinese than the French, because the Chinese tests intercept about 7 times the population than the French tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commenced with the assertion that if we can confine the argument to the super powers that have <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons we reduce the danger of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My greatest fear is that when France or one of the middle powers almost achieves parity as far as <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons are concerned it should sublet them to lesser powers; I have in mind particularly the Middle East. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation will be compounded if France in a Bonapartism of the 1970s decided to flow to these countries some <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me take it a little further to the question of venues for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that there were a number of middle powers- I think that Italy came into this category- who were not so strong in their views about the military limitations of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power but who had some fears that their industrial expansion would be curbed if they did not share in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> knowhow, I think it was a complete distortion by  Senator McManus  to link nations which had a rightful concern about the limitation of their commercial expansion with other nations that took a different attitude on the military aspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister  Mr Whitlam,  is able to move effectively in the big league, and goodness knows he is, then to my way of thinking it means that in the final crunch we reduce the fear of another war and its <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> dangers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate deplores the Government’s double standards in respect of atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing by China and France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both China and France in recent weeks and months have exploded <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> devices in the atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was expressed quite clearly on behalf of the LiberalCountry Party Government by the then Foreign Minister,  Mr Nigel  Bowen, who in the United Nations led a successful resolution condemning atmospheric testing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons anywhere in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We oppose atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing by any country and our opposition is equally strong to any country conducting these tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>France and ignore China in protesting about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By what percentages has the present radiation level been contributed to by past <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing by (a) the United Kingdom, (b) the United States of America, (c) the Union Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, (d) The People ‘s Republic of China, and (e) France? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that against the fact that I, like my colleagues, am totally opposed to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do this by X-rays and we do it in terms of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it was calculated by scientistsand this is beyond dispute- to create more danger in terms of long term fallout, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> isotopes throughout the world, than one exploded over the sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He then proceeds to attack the French and to defend the Chinese, and, I repeat, to suggest that there was some justification for the Chinese embarking on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is I think of some significance that perhaps the greatest of our <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> scientists in Australia, Professor  Sir Ernest  Titterton, is on record as saying that if we are to rap anybody we should rap China because in his words the effect of the Chinese bomb is exposed immediately to 7 times more people in terms of world population than that of the French. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia is getting fallout from Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests, leading Australian scientist,  Sir Ernest  Titterton, said today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam said at a Press conference later that winds from the Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing did not come within thousands of miles of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here we have a leading <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> scientist, one whose views are upheld by his colleagues, refuting what the Prime Minister has said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australians who wanted to vent their indignation about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing should direct their emotion against the Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests, Professor  Sir Ernest  Titterton said yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it that Australia’s Ambassador to France, having returned to Australia, was allowed to say that he was going to stay in Australia for some 6 weeks or more to protest against the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests but our Ambassador in Peking was encouraged to stay there and do nothing by way of showing resentment against the Chinese? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting- I have already pointed this out- that there has been a conspiracy of silence on the part of the Australian Government about telling the people of Australia the facts about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fallout and man-made fallout. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless there is some technical flaw in the methods of New Zealand Government scientists the incidence of extra-natural radiation fallout is decreasing in an almost inverse ratio to that of political opposition to Chinese and French atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobel Prize winning author Alexander Solzhenitsyn has called Australia ‘s protests over <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing hypocritical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I, in common with other people in this Parliament and in Australia, am opposed to increasing man-made <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fall-out where it is possible to stop it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only comments that the Labor Government has made in recent days about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests is to think aloud whether the French have stopped or have not stopped their <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He justified their conducting of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests on that ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently the fallout from the Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions in the northern hemisphere, in proximity to approximately one-third of the world’s population, is particularly potent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The country that these men represent is <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing on a scale infinitely greater than the scale on which the French are testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian Prime Minister,  Mr Whitlam,  said today that France’s <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing program was more monstrous than China’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators of  Dr J.  F. Cairns visit to China when he said he took up with Chou En-lai the question of Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The US will provide a shield if a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power threatens the freedom of a nation allied with the US or a nation vital to US security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is reported also that a significant proportion of the Russian <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> deterrent as well as a significant part of its air power is facing China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  when he was in Canada recently stated that he could have some feeling for the Chinese in exploding <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons because they feared they were under threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one who has any knowledge of military matters would say that the only threat would come on the border, that the only fighting would take place on the border, because everybody knows that the Soviet Union has <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> submarines spread all over the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we all hope that we will not be involved in an issue like this, with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> submarines in the Pacific and Indian oceans and ourselves in the middle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said all that, the fact is that the major powers or the great powers of the world are trying to bring about a situation whereby, owing to some accident or some flare-up, the world will not be destroyed by a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> holocaust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-For Senator 0 ‘Byrne’s information, the Russians have more than 75 conventional submarines and 70 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> powered submarines in that fleet alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The killing that is going on at this moment between Russian and Chinese troops on the Manchurian border could lead to a conflict that might even result in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> warfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is a man of some 52 years of age, a married man, a great <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> physicist and a man who some years ago formed within Russia the human rights committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard constant condemnation of France because it is conducting <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in another attack on the West, accuses New Zealand and Australia of cowardice for protesting against the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests but not against the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests carried out by the People’s Republic of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But a war in which <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> powers could be involved on a world scale would be a devastating experience for’ mankind and the contribution or involvement or otherwise of Australia in such a matter would be so small that it is absurd to suggest that Australia could start even to contemplate having defence forces on  s  scale that would be material to such a world conflict, which would probably be over even before a report could-be made to the Senate of its commencement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731018_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government’s determined opposition to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing in the atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, we have in the statement a reference to the fact that the Prime Minister raised or reaffirmed the Australian Government’s determined opposition to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing in the atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, reading the comments of commentators who associated with the Prime Minister on his trip, one can accept that the Prime Minister did not initiate the discussion on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that interview the question of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing was raised and the Australian Government’s view- and I state advisedly the Government’s view, because it was a view with which the Opposition was completely identified -was expressed to the Chinese Vice-Premier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a view that China believed it had a right to have a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> capability, that China was to continue with its <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing until it had that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> capability and that while America, Britain and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics had a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> capability it was China’s right and entitlement to have the same capability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that France has made quite clear in similarity uncomprising terms its intention to continue with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing in the atmosphere until it has perfected its <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> capability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greatest defect of thinking of this Government of ours is that not only are men an island but Australia is an island unto itself and that Australia somehow can be isolated against the world- a world in which an oil crisis in the Middle East is being engendered and which could create world war; a world in which some 2 years ago at the time of the Bangladesh outbreak it was feared with some justification that Russia might seek to knock out the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> establishments of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is noted that the money spent on solar energy investigation in Australia is insignificant in comparison with the money spent on the investigation of other energy sources such as <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One might as well say that what was good for the age of Adam Smith is good for the age of multinational corporations, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons and a world wide crisis of the system itself, based on the profligate misuse of resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the implications for every country of the current international energy crisis as a result of the withholding of oil supplies from the Middle East and as Australia is not self sufficient in liquid petroleum or oil will the Minister indicate the programs under way with Commonwealth assistance to explore aU sources of energy generation, that is, petroleum, petroleum gas, solar heating, hydrogenation of coal, kerosene shales, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and tidal energy generation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We feel strongly that since <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy is a possible threat to the genetic balance of future generations, you- our Government- can only find favour with all Australians should you promote an energy program which is not only infinite in supply but also totally clean ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-9-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although obviously the most serious and most disastrous thing that could happen to the world would be a third world war, particularly a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war, at the same time it would be a rather grim prospect for the people of the world if the consequence of the relaxation were to mean that the Soviet Union was free to send its tanks into Czechoslovakia and the United States of America was free to send its marines into the Dominican Republic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Government’s opposition to atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing based on moral grounds as well as the possible effect of the testing upon health? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I think that the subject matter raised in the first part of the question actually comes under the portfolio of  Senator Murphy,  but I think our attitude to the question of atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing is well known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In a world in which the present <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> rectors use the fuel in uranium 235 in an inefficient manner so that only 1 per cent or 2 per cent of the potential is used, it is vital that breeder reactors should be developed so that the enriched fuel which is taken up to a few more per cent in capacity is used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that to generate electricity at this moment in Australia, with our abundance of steaming coal, it would be madness to use <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors in their present stage of development in terms of cheapness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of various factors, but above all the compelling restraints of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> balance, the long term prospect for global stability and avoidance of general war and for the limitation of local conflicts remains favourable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the report is correct will the Prime Minister protest in a similar way against the Chinese atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests by refusing any invitation to attend receptions given by the Ambassador of the People’s Republic of China until such time as China discontinues atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests, thereby demonstrating the Government’s much vaunted evenhandedness? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator MURPHY (New South WalesAttorneyGeneral) For the information of honourable senators I table the following 2 documents relating to the proceedings by Australia against France in the International Court of Justice concerning the prohibition of further atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests at the French Pacific Test Centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think we are burying our heads in the sand if we assume that we can do without <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power in a country which is poorly endowed, in terms of our long term needs, with fossil fuels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A formula will be established ‘to enable each <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power reactor, operating, committed for construction or planned for operation 10 years into the future to operate on an average annual capacity factor of 80 per cent for 30 years from the start of the period ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Power generating utilities overseas are already committed to building <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plants for which fuel could become scarce, and some countries are concerned at the implications of a shortage of fuel at a time of increased reliance on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power for base-load generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether he has seen newsagency reports that the French Foreign Minister announced in the United Nations General Assembly on 23 September last that France has finished atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing and would conduct further experiments underground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, is Australia still pursuing its proceedings in the International Court of Justice concerning atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests by France? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have now reached a stage in our <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology that makes it possible for us to continue our program by underground testing, and we have taken steps to do so as early as next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that the Government of France, while apparently taking a step in the right direction, is still reserving to itself the right to carry out atmospheric <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator might say that if a world-wide <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> conflict broke out, surely Australia would be affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there were a total <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> conflict we would be wiped out, as would anyone else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The change from the extended biological family we had in the past to the more fragile <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> family, the increase in the breadth of education for women in our society and the changing role of opportunities for women have all made marriage a more stressful situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What contribution to that level has been made by (a) natural radiation and (b) <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-45-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>&amp; (2) The following table gives the radiation doses estimated to have been incurred by the Australian population during the past 12 months from natural sources and from fall-out from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions in the atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-45-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The doses include the contributions made during the 12 month period, from fall-out from all <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests to date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-45-13">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, fresh fission product fall-out is still reaching Australia from the recent series of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests by France in Polynesia and fallout over Australia of long-lived radioisotopes will continue for some years from the high yield explosions that both France and China have carried out in the atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-45-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The family of today, styled in the modern day language as the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> family, is not the family of yesteryear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By way of preface I would like to refer to reports of the intention to use the Antarctic as a dumping ground for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, Article 5 (2) states that international agreements concerning the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and disposal of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes shall apply in the Antarctic if all Antarctic Treaty parties agree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister and some other Ministers in addition to the Minister for Science have earlier expressed strong misgivings about proposals to dump <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste in the Antarctic, especially in the absence of scientific data concerning the likely effect of such dumping on the Antarctic environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part of the direction, of course, in the case of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> disaster is that the people who are responsible for the organisation, for evacuation and so on get as far out of town as possible so that the equipment and personnel are preserved in order to come back to do the cleaning up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He quoted the Nixon ploy of:   the issue of defence spending in terms of a hand (presumably  McGovern’s  knocking toy ships and aeroplanes off a table, or for that matter, of the 1964 ‘Daisy Girl’ spot used by the Democrats, which linked Barry Goldwater to the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> incineration of little girls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think all of us agree that whatever is contained in this Bill is linked with all the various other treaties concerned with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> warfare, and the plain fact of the matter is that Australia has been agitated about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think even a former Prime Minister,  Mr McMahon,  had to exercise his sovereign powers about United States <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> naval craft coming here if there was an element of danger that there could be some serious catastrophe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In any case people like  Senator Sheil  would use a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon in return, if they could get their fingers on one, to wipe out the black problem, as they call it, for all time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For this reason insurers in many parts of the world have been introducing into their policies clauses excluding the consequences of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> hazards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may well be that in 10 years or 1 5 years- more or less- coal may find itself under very severe competition in the energy producing sector from all sorts of other sources such as <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power, water, solar radiation and so on down the line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is a party to the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation treaty and it may be taken as read that the Government will comply with all its obligations under that treaty in any matters concerning the mining and sale of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I support the comments of  Senator Jessop  about the need for research into fields such as solar and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The basic understanding of the sale of uranium and other minerals to Japan, especially uranium, has been exclusively on the basis that Japan would not sign the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> nonproliferation treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that Japan has revised its projected <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy requirements for 1985 from the 1972 prediction of 60 million kilowatts to the 1975 prediction of 49 million kilowatts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he also aware that Japan is unlikely to achieve a 25 million kilowatt requirement by 1985; that it has achieved only a 47 per cent capacity factornot the predicted 80 per cent- for its <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors; and that, in any case, Japan requires only 99 000 tonnes of uranium to produce the predicted energy requirement of 60 million kilowatts- of which 88 200 tonnes has already been covered by existing contracts from the following sources: France, 8800 tonnes, Australia 5600 tonnes, South Africa 38 200 tonnes, and Canada 35 600 tonnes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to recent reports that the French Government has resumed <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that there was a French underground <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test in the Pacific on 2 April. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That it represents a major escalation of the arms race, and directly involves Australia even further in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war strategies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That therefore an Omega station built in Australia would be a prime <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> target. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to some recent Press reports concerning an alleged Japanese proposal for a scheme to recycle <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste somewhere in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: Is it necessary to obtain the approval of the Commonwealth Government and presumably of himself before any such proposal can be implemented which would involve the importation of such <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste from Japan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place, I have seen a report in a Western Australian newspaper of a proposal- as I understand the report- that there should be this <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste recycling in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite obviously, if any proposal for recycling <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste were to be proposed anywhere in Australia I think it would raise the greatest concern in government and it would necessitate the most objective environmental study that could be obtained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That it represents a major escalation of the arms race, and directly involves Australia even further in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war strategies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>and (2) Yes; since Australia does not reprocess spent <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel the Sandia process has no direct application in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-48-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not accept the propositions that other nations have gained military ascendancy over us, that the Administration has neglected our defenses, or that negotiations to reduce the threat of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war are unwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This estimate is based on the report ‘Uranium- Resources, Production and Demand’ published jointly by the OECD <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Energy Agency and the International Atomic Energy Agency in December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-66-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate who represents the Minister for National Resources, I refer to the proposed visit to Australia by a group of Japanese businessmen to discuss development of uranium resources and, in particular, the alleged proposal that Japanese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste should be stored in remote parts of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the Commonwealth Government be prepared to entertain any proposal for the storage of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste from Japan in any parts of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the other part of the honourable senator’s question in respect of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste facilities, I point out to the Senate that in view of Australia’s constitutional powers and responsibilities under the treaty on the non-proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons, any question relating to the establishment of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste facilities in Australia is a matter for the Commonwealth Government alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Press reports in early June stated that the Japanese Prime Minister,  Mr Miki,  had indicated that the Japanese Government was not giving any thought to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste facilities in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has Japan recently revised its projected <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy requirements for 1985 from the 1972 prediction; if so, what are the relative figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-69-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In December 1975 the Japanese Ministerial Council on General Energy Policy adopted a report which included an estimate for 1985 of 49 000 MW installed <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> generating capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-69-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is the statement by the  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Mr Anthony,  that he would be happy to sell uranium to the Soviet Union and would accept guarantees by the Soviet Union that it would not be used for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable senators  I  present a series of reports by the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council, the Australian Radiation Laboratory, and the Bureau of Meteorology entitled: ‘Fallout Over Australia From <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Tests’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the problem probably of greater importance is that our society in its post industrial phase has developed into one of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> families where families of 2 generations live in accommodation where there is neither the ability nor often the desire for immediate members of families- for sons, daughters or anybody else- to care for the increasing numbers of aged persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Is <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fall-out monitoring still being carried out on the Atherton Tableland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-34-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of preface, I point out to the Minister that it is claimed that the United States of America has the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> capacity to destroy the Soviet Union 35 times and that the Soviet Union has the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> capacity to destroy the United States 15 times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the warning of the General Secretary of the United Nations, Kurt Waldheim, that the armament fever was becoming an epidemic, how seriously does the Government view the call from the recent Returned Services League Congress for Australia to embark on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> armament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the matter of uranium mining and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that an explosion occurred during routine chemical separation of Americium-241 from reactor waste products and that the explosion was chemical not <span class="highlight">nuclear</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I recall, what  Dr Sabine  said in Western Austalia was not just that Western Australia should be used as a dumping ground for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister confirm that the Government adheres unequivocally to its commitment to the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Non-Proliferation Treaty? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister also confirm that the Government believes that Australia’s efforts should be directed to supporting the limitation or reduction of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> armaments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As is well known, the Government is strongly opposed to the proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the Government has welcomed the recent decision by several governments, particularly Japan, to ratify the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Non-Proliferation Treaty, taking the number of parties to this important Treaty to over 100. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has been actively participating in international efforts to ensure that the export of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> equipment, materials and technology remains under effective controls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has decided that as a minimum- I repeat, a minimum- our policies will reflect our international obligations that arise from our adherence to the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Non-Proliferation Treaty and, in some respects, it has in mind seeking more stringent conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of these statements, I ask the Minister the following question: How does he reconcile his view that ‘there is no military significance’ attached to Omega with the United States Navy reports and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Defence Ministry reports which give a high strategic value to the Omega system in coordinating <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> strikes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would he not agree that Omega, being a highly potential <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> target, would be a disadvantage to Australian people in the vicinity of such a base? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main thrust of evidence before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence of this Parliament was against the honourable senator’s first premise which was that both the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics regard Omega as being essential for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> strikes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The volume of scientific evidence before the Committee was that no country would use Omega for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> strikes, because of its potential serious inaccuracy and vagaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make it clear that all scientific evidence shows that any electrical flare- that is, any solar flare or any large lightning storm- can affect Omega, therefore making it seriously inaccurate and putting in absolute peril the guiding of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make it clear also that all evidence is that if there were to be a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosion of any kind in the atmosphere that of itself would deflect Omega and make it totally unreliable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who are aware of the findings know that all evidence shows that the long range ballistic missile <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> submarines use their own inertial system plus the transit satellite system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The world wide consensus is that Omega would not be used for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> vessels; that it would be far too inaccurate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a recent report of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test conducted by the People’s Republic of China and a further report of heavy radioactivity fall-out in the United States following the reported test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-According to the briefing note I have, China has announced that it conducted a further <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test in the atmosphere on 26 September and our Ambassador in Peking has been asked to express again our concern to the Chinese authorities about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing and in particular about the latest Chinese test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister enlarge upon the significance of this discovery and say whether it has anything to do with radioactive leakage from the drums of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste to which the sponges are attached? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Have reports emanating from the National Congress of the Returned Services League of Australia urged the Government to (a) build a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor so that it can manufacture <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons, (b) reintroduce conscription to raise the strength of the Army to 38 000 men, and (c) double defence expenditure so that not less than 5 per cent of gross domestic product is spent on defence; if so, has a reply been made on behalf of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-65-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It may be that many people in this community who expect to gain a lot in terms of money from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power will support that proposition, but many people involved in trade unions will oppose that proposition because they do not see it being in the interests of their society, their children or the community in which they live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take up with him a radio report this morning that quantities of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste are deposited at Maralinga in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I did not hear the media report this morning relating to the disposal of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste at Maralinga in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister whether reports in the Dunedin  Evening Star  and the Christchurch  Star  of Saturday, 9 October 1976 that the United States planned to ship 6500 cubic metres of soil contaminated by radioactivity from the McMurdo Sound <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generator in the Antarctic are accurate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to recent statements concerning the dumping of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste material at Maralinga in South Australia in 1960 and 1961. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because of the fundamental significance of the whole question of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power and what it means to the whole of mankind, I believe it would be a futile contribution for us to assume either partywise or individually that we have the answers and that we know precisely the course that we as a nation should follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that even if this Government or the 2 major parties together agreed that there would be no export of uranium from Australia and that our uranium would not be used for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry this progress would go on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether the benefits of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry would serve the whole of mankind seems to be a secondary consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As long as <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry serves our needs that seems to be all we are concerned about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That factor alone, in view of the colossal investment involved by the wealthy nations in developing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry, ought to be something that we recognise as we wrestle with the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unquestionably, tremendous benefits are to be gained from the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that any person would argue that under no circumstances should our uranium be developed for a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry and exported but, at the same time, it is perfectly clear to all of us, and the Fox report makes it clear, that there are as yet unsolved problems with the disposal of waste, plutonium, accidents, war, terrorism and all the rest of the dangers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, we accept the fact that assuming those problems can be overcome there is an enormous future for the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry around the world, providing we can see that the benefits are extended as widely among mankind as they can be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have no pressing need for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one takes into account the increasing cost of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology there is, in our belief, no need to make such quick decisions as have been taken and which we hope will not be indicative of future decisions in respect of the development of this industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we consider that picture as a whole we can see that there would be a tremendous potential for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power around the world and where, as  Mr Justice  Fox points out, it can be shown that the development of the industry will not be harmful to mankind we ought to avail ourselves of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not wish to quote them all -there is simply not time- but he emphasised the dangers of radiation at all stages of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle, the nature of plutonium and the possibility of its creating diseases in human beings, the general problem of waste and the associated difficulties that go with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that despite our inability as individuals, or even perhaps collectively, to find solutions to these problems there has to be a greater emphasis in our contribution as a nation towards such agreements as the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation treaty and the International Atomic Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not find much in the constitution of the Agency that would give us hope that that Agency could control the movement of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> materials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could well be that we could contribute towards the development of an international body which would have sole rights over the movement of all <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we have no alternative but to go ahead and look for further energy sources, and in that regard perhaps I could quote from the report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry in which  Mr Justice  Fox deals with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and alternatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can look to wind, tidal, hydro-electric, geo-thermal and solar energy as well as to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that we as a nation and other nations will do much more research in it because I believe that solar energy, with its cleanliness, will be the great energy giver to the world in years to come; but in the interim period there is this energy gap about which we have been talking and we have to turn to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present there are 159 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power units in operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a further 337 proposed <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> units or units already under construction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The escalation in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy is taking place in the United States of Amenca, where there are 54 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations and another 168 are proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One appreciates that there are the grave dangers of proliferation which  Senator Wriedt  mentioned earlier tonight and that there is the danger of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> warfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Countries which seek <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> warfare and are hell bent on such destruction will not worry about the  cost  of production or about the cost to humanity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to the dangers of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy itself and of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To give an example of these dangers I again quote from the paper by  Mr Bernard  L. Cohen, where he states: since our country - that is, America- needs a power plant for every half million people, and a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plant kills an average of 0.01 people per year, an individual’s probability of being killed by a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plant is one chance in50 million per year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> power is as dangerous as driving one extra mile per year, an average of5 extra yards per day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power represents the same danger to an average citizen as the danger to a farmer from spending5 minutes extra per year visiting a city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that there are problems with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste, but much research is being done in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So many reliable countries are doing so much research at this time and are acting responsibly that one cannot fully accept the fear campaign with regard to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste, even though I accept that there are still problems associated with its disposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether or not we supply 25 per cent of the world’s requirements, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy is being used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaving aside questions respecting terrorism, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes and proliferation, our assessment of the position is that while the operations of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry need close regulation and constant surveillance, they probably do not entail risks greater in sum than those inherent in alternative energy industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Export should be subject to the fullest and most effective safeguards agreements, and be supported by fully adequate back-up agreements applying to the entire civil <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry in the country supplied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Mr Anthony,  as recently as 12 August this year when in London stated that we will be selling uranium only to those countries which are members of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation treaty, to those countries which are agreeing to the international safeguards, and that we will be wanting to draw up bilateral trade agreements with countries to ensure that all of those requirements are met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The decision on where, when and whether to mine uranium in Australia and to export uranium from Australia and where we will go with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology in Australia is one of the most difficult decisions and difficult problems that this Parliament will have to face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think to put things into perspective it is worthwhile remembering that at the moment we are still in the early stages of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the work, both theoretical and practical, that has been done on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology by men like Thomson, Max Planck, Niels Borhr, Einstein, Rutherford, Zillard, Enrico Fermi and all the others, was done this century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also worth remembering that concern about the dangers of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology and about the morality of how it should be used is not the invention of just a few radicals and a few conservatives in the last few years; such concern was first expressed by the scientists who were working on the Manhattan project from 1941 to 1945. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were very concerned, and scientists who work in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology are still concerned and still express their concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Fox report points out, it is wrong to label the opponents of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology as radicals and subversives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> technology has developed at a very rapid rate in the last 30 years to 35 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some countries like Sweden, Austria, France, West Germany, Britain, Japan and India, faced with poor fossil fuel resources, high oil costs and uncertain oil supplies, have opted for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power to a certain extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other countries like the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United States of America, Canada and Iran have opted for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power to a certain extent to protect their dwindling fossil fuel sources, their dwindling oil sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in Australia are in a position where we have no need at the moment for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But even in those countries which have opted for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power, serious questions are being raised about how they should go in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I personally do not take either of the extremist views on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology and uranium that are about in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also am not impressed by the argument of those who say that we will never develop safe <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology, therefore we should leave all the material in the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The problems talked about in the Fox report and in the Flowers report of terrorists or fanatics obtaining <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons are real. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The serious concern about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor safety, especially after the incident at Browns Ferry in the United States, where an electrician with a candle almost caused a tragedy, and what to do with reactors after their 30 or 40 years’ life is up are real problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Non-proliferation Treaty, which is aimed at preventing the proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons in the world and on which  Senator Young  hung his hat for one part of his argument, firstly has no teeth and, secondly, has not been signed by many of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power using countries in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fortunately it would seem that the costs of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power production are escalating so much that in the United States and other countries orders are being cancelled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not saying that we will never be able to develop safe <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would regret it if the arguments about the export of a few thousand tonnes from Mary Kathleen, which will make no difference to the world ‘s attitude to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power and which will make no difference to the supplies which go to Japan, West Germany and the United States, should become the basis of the very real argument which  Mr Justice  Fox and the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry have brought up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely we can make our voice heard when we talk about international agreements to stop the proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power in the world and international agreements about the treatment of terrorists or fanatics who may well get hold of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well to remember that there already have been attacks upon <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations in the world- and that an attack in Argentine was successful and that terrorists held control of a station for a few hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should we not be leading the world in the development of alternative non-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power sources? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not be condemning those who are concerned and those who express their concern about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power in the way they were condemned in the debate in the other House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another proviso, as  Senator Young  has said and as  Mr Anthony  already has indicated, is that only those countries which are signatories to the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Non-Proliferation Treaty should receive our uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most of the developed nations have <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the fact is that nation after nation has considered this matter and nation after nation has made its decision over these 30 years to develop <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power for peaceful purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Are we to miss out on all the advantages that can accrue from the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be interesting to read some of the answers given in reply to these sort of people by Professor Titterton whom I think most Australians regard as probably our top <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> physicist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>160 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations are already operating and, after 2000 power station years of operation, there has not been a single death or injury to the public at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The U.K., U.S.A., Soviet Union, France, Canada, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, West Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Holland, Pakistan, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland and many others are investing massively in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed 180 new <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations are currently being built and another 1 60 are on order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the year 2000 near to SO per cent of all electricity generated in the world will be from <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Power Stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not essential to have <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations to produce a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons capability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now refer to the safety of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fox report referred to ‘many wildly exaggerated statements’ made about the risks and dangers of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy production by those opposed to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Misleading and unfounded propaganda of the antinuclear lobby is continuing to confuse and worry the public and make it difficult for the average citizen to make a wellbased decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts are: <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> power has proved to be among the safest industries yet established in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, official United States figures show that the annual death rate in the coal industry is 1 1 times greater than that in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry (including mining), injuries 7 times greater, and man days lost some 10 times greater. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Radioactive waste has been handled completely safely over the 20-year history of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power production and plans now in hand for vitrification of waste material are technically sound and feasible and will lead to a continuation of this excellent record as the industry grows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret that  Senator Mulvihill  referred to people in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry in Australia as wicked men who are more interested in making money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> power development in the world has a long history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the first <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation plant there was established in 1956. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From that time onwards there has been an increasing interest in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy for the reasons I have just mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one mentions the mining of uranium most people tend to start talking immediately about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a different kettle offish from the matter of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hazards involved in the ordinary operations of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power reactors, if those operations are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to mine and sell Australian uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recently published Fox Ranger uranium environmental report goes a long way in pointing out the hazards, fears and misunderstandings associated with the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger report is an excellent one and one of the few and rare attempts to look at <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power without using rose coloured glasses, as did those honourable senators opposite, including the optometrist, who spoke tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By this action the Federal Government has lost its credibility, and future generations will look to this day as the day that Australia buried its head in the sand, because that was the convenient thing to do, when it had the chance to lead the world out of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> quagmire in which it had immersed itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many indications in the Fox report that the commissioners considered that their inquiry was to form the basis of a broad public debate on the issues of uranium mining and the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy industry, and that the final decision should be taken by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A close analysis of the Fox report shows that there are many disturbing features associated with the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy industry and these should be debated at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an urgent need to review the safety of the uranium fuel cycle and despite all the cries by <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> proponents that it is safe; this has not been demonstrated to date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this chamber tonight  Senator Young,  speaking on behalf of the Government tried to make the point that the oil rich countries might hold the world to ransom and therefore it is necessary to develop <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the point that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy does not replace oil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Oil is the energy we need for transport- <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power cannot be used for transport- and it is in the field of transport that the greatest shortage of fuel will be found. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> energy can replace coal, of which there is no shortage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be far more appropriate if the high capital costs incurred in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industries were  rediverted  to research and development of more permanent alternative energy sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proponents for uranium mining and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power point to the economic advantages of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> produced electricity over other energy forms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Data compiled by the Head of the Section for Economic Studies in the IAEA’s Division of <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Power and Reactors confirm the weight of evidence that the relative advantage in capital costs held by coal-fired stations has not diminished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The evidence also indicates that small scale <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plants are unlikely to be economic when compared with coal-fired units of the same size. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet at the moment the Premier of Queensland is saying that he wants <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-That is all right, because you would give the coal away to the markets of the world while you start setting up your <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in Australia, with our vast coal reserves, should not be stampeded into condoning <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power until all aspects of the industry are fully and exhaustively debated publicly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The economic viability of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry has not been adequately demonstrated, especially in view of the non-completion of the uranium fuel cycle and the hazards involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case, the ‘polluter pays’ principle will not be followed and the competitive position of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power compared with alternative energy sources will be artificially improved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> and coal generation costs are close. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The delivered price of coal varies over a wide enough range that in some regions coal plants may generate electricity for less cost than do <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, coal and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plants are close enough that they might be considered the same, given the uncertainty associated with the estimates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New coal fired stations, rather than increase <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> capacity, could be built to cope with increased demand for electricity at least until other sources of energy arc more fully developed . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The evidence indicates that use of coal rather than further extensions of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power would not, in general, cause very substantial overall increases in the cost of electricity or in the general level of prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The downward revisions over the past 2 years in anticipated additions to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> capacity have led to reductions in estimated uranium requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this indicates clearly that the economic advantages of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry have not been established, not to mention the environmental and health hazards associated with this industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would be wise to adhere to recommendation 14 of the Fox report and allow a lengthy period of time for debate and to observe the trends in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to the unproven viability of the world’s <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry, the net benefits to be gained from uranium mining in Australia have not yet been sufficiently demonstrated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The evidence indicates that the risks are presently real and will tend to increase with the further spread of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The findings that the hazards involved in the ordinary operations of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors are not by themselves sufficient reasons not to develop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are simply findings relating to some specific operations in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> cycle, operations that were called into question during the inquiry … A decision by Australia not to export uranium may or may not decisively influence the course of international events, but the probability is rather that any action taken by Austalia will have some effect even though this cannot be gauged with accuracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Keating, the Shadow Minister for National Resources, claimed in the debate that the government has made no acknowledgement of the powers and hazards associated with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power mentioned by the commission throughout the body of its report’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This leaves us with only one alternative at present- albeit an interim one- and that is <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> energy is just another source of power; it is as simple as that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be used with a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor to generate electricity and it will help to keep our fossil fuels just that little bit longer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at the economics of the matter, a feasibility study in 1974 of the Loy Yang power station in the Latrobe Valley showed a cost of 0.61c per kilowatt hour for a brown coal fossil fuel power station and 0.63c per killowatt hour for a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station- that is, a station with a potential output of 4000 megawatts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plants saved utilities over $2 billion in generating costs in 1975, compared with burning fossil fuels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1975 United States <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plants saved the equivalent of the burning of more than 238 million barrels of oil or more than 50 million tonnes of coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> generating cost in the United States in 1975 was 1.227c per kilowatt hour which was 63 per cent less than oil and 30 per cent less than coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in this day and age we find that the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plant is indeed an economic proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they have growing cities and no source of power, the obvious thing for them to do is to look towards <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at it, one sees that a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor is nothing more than a source of heat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite significant that not one life has been lost to this time at any <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor power generation plant in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A 1000 megawatt power station would use 140 tonnes of yellow cake a year if it was a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So here we see the significance of developing countries being able to use <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power as compared with all the ancillary industries needed to export steaming coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amount that comes from the earth, the sun and outer space is 83.7 per cent, while 13.5 per cent comes from medical use- X- rays, etc.- 2.1 per cent from fallout from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> tests, 0.7 per cent from industrial and miscellaneous use and 0.01 per cent from the uraniumnuclear fuel cycle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been mentioned that it is more dangerous to fly in an aircraft from Sydney to Perth than it is to live beside a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station for 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For those who are betting men and like the odds, let me say that there is one chance in 5000 million of being killed from a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is common knowledge that one-third of the fuel rods are taken out of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor every year and replaced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate is discussing- and I think that would be the context in which we ought to be dealing with this important matter- the first report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry which means we discuss <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the spread of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power will inevitably facilitate the spread of the ability to make <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons and, we fear, the construction of these weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of general <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> policy for the United Kingdom that report reads: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet one would imagine from the contributions of  Senator Collard  and his colleagues that we have no alternative but to use <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy as the source of energy for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We agree strongly with the view repeatedly put to us by opponents of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> development, that, given a sufficient understanding of the science and technology involved, the final decisions should rest with the ordinary man and not be regarded as the preserve of any group of scientists or experts, however distinguished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An alternative argument, which is partly moral and partly economic, has been put by those advocating uranium mining, the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power, and a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> based economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the argument that the world’s energy resources are in danger of imminent exhaustion and that therefore the alternative expensive <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology has to be developed has been dismissed by the Fox commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have examined the relative costs of electricity generated by coal and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy, particularly in those countries which are said to be critically dependent on Australian uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If coal is in the future made available to such countries at prices equivalent to recent prices, the cost of electricity generated from it is likely to be only marginally higher than the cost of electricity generated from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Figures prepared for me by the Legislative Research Service of the Parliamentary Library suggest that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power does not have an outstanding economic advantage over coal in the case of a power station on which construction commenced in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Do many proponents of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power claim that the level of fatalities and the level of diseases associated with uranium mining will be reduced if mine workers wear heavy protective clothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister recall the question I raised as a matter of urgency on 30 November- 9 days ago-about the public concern being expressed about the burial of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes at Maralinga in South Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As sufficient time has elapsed since I raised the question, can I be assured that the Government will provide me with an answer before the Senate  rises  so that public concern about the safety aspects of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste can be answered? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Is one of the main problems confronting the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy industry at the moment the inefficiency of the fast breeder reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fast breeder reactors (FBRs) have inherently a higher <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> efficiency or breeding potential, and a higher thermal efficiency than current thermal <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>In addition, consideration is being given to the use of thorium, a fertile material which can breed uranium-233 another <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel with properties roughly equivalent to uranium-235. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What percentage of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power currently generated in the United States of America is used for (a) electrical generation, and (b) transportation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not possible to distinguish between the various sources of utility power but it could be assumed that a similar percentage would be drawn from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Figures are, however, available for the expenditures of the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Power and Reactors Division of the Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The objective of this Division is ‘to disseminate information on the technology and economics of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power, reactors, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuels and materials, to provide assistance and advice to member States in the application of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power for generating electricity and for water desalination, and to facilitate the use of research reactors for research and training’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Power and Reactors Division’s activities extend beyond the promotion of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power to activities such as <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safety, environmental protection and information and technical services, its total expenditures have been listed in the following table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are reports in the  Dunedin Evening Star  and the  Christchurch Star  of 9 October 1976 that the United States of America plans to ship 6500 cubic metres of soil contaminated by radioactive material from the McMurdo Sound <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generator in the Antarctic accurate; if so, does this proposal involve a violation of Article 5 of the Antarctic Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>According to information provided by United States authorities, a routine inspection in 1972 of the McMurdo Sound <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor revealed some evidence of wetting of insulating material by shield water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely in that time and once these industries are developed, some other source of power will be developed, albeit <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power, but that of course is another argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Rather than proffer a bland assumption about possible constancy of events in this region, the White Paper should have discussed in more detail the alternatives which Australia might face, although I am sure that all of us without reservation reject the concept of the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons in any conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So we had a United States marine regimental combat team to produce that portion of the exercise, with its vertical take-off and landing aircraft, its cover coming from the vast resources of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> carrier  Enterprise,  and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that honourable senators will find that what Representative Aspin puts forward- he has not been contradicted- shows quite the contrary, that is, that the U.S.A. still has overwhelming preponderance over the Soviet Union in both <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> and conventional weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can see no logical reason why it should be assumed that if the superpowers withdrew from the Indian Ocean there would then be a sea of peace because there would then be no other navies- and there are significant navies and air forces and also <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> capacities- around the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other matter to which I make some reference concerns a statement which appeared to say that there has been no extension of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Report suggests that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material should only be supplied to a state on the basis that its entire <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry is subject to back-up safeguards that can not be terminated by unilateral withdrawal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of the Minister to a report appearing in the Brisbane  Courier-Mail  under a Bonn, Germany, dateline of 16 March 1977 to the effect that a West German court at Baden- -Wurttemberg after 2 years litigation had cancelled planning permission and imposed a permanent ban on the construction of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station on the grounds of inadequate safety precautions and serious reservations about plans for evacuating the area in the event of a break-down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the warning in the Fox report that adequate time should be given for debate on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power, will the Minister obtain from our Embassy in Germany details of these court proceedings, which lasted over 2 years, and table them in the Senate so that honourable senators who have grave doubts about the safety aspects of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power can study them prior to this country’s being involved in a similar situation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until all governments accept that there is a great deal of good will in all countries, whatever the ideology of their governments, the world will live in a constant atmosphere of danger with the consequences of the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons hanging over our heads. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Therefore it is my view that in the longer term, certainly in the next 20 years or 25 years, it may be necessary to promote, under proper supervision, the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy- something which has been going on already for over 20 years- as an alternative to the traditional energy derived from oil and coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this were to happen, together with the fairly clearly indicated relative cheapness of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy, it would involve an increase in the opportunities available to the developing third world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>3 ) If no figures for the likely increase in the death rate are available, does this indicate that scientists and doctors have little or no idea about the dangers and the limits of dangers associated with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would not be correct to assume that scientists and doctors have little or no idea about the dangers associated with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power, merely because there are no widely accepted figures relating to the possible increase in deaths which could be attributed to the release of radio-active wastes and materials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1) In the light of the recent Fox Inquiry finding that ‘if one accepts even the more conservative estimates of the development of peaceful <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy programs in a large number of countries during the rest of this century, the costs of the application of safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency might increase to an extent where there would be opposition by member states to paying such a substantial bill’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-22">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will these cost increases serve to make coal generated electricity competitive or even cheaper than <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> derived electricity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Could these cost increases result in member states refusing to be involved in the application of such <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>, (2) and (3) The effect of any increased safeguards costs will be small taken over all <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, improvements in safeguards techniques, grouping of facilities, the use of regional safeguards offices, and increasing managerial expertise may be expected to cause some reduction in unit safeguards costs, Other factors such as geographical location and availability of resources are far more significant determinants of the relative competitiveness of coal and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> generated electricity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The application of international safeguards in particular countries arises from their obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Weapons and/or as a condition of supply of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> equipment or material by supplying countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the course of the Committee’s inquiry the ongoing arguments over uranium mining and the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power have resulted in solar power being promoted by anti-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> proponents and others as a readily available energy alternative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the past few weeks for example, there has been an important statement by  President  Carter on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy in which he emphasised the need to restrain the spread of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons or explosive capabilities without forgoing the tangible benefits of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again, at their recent summit meeting, the Heads of Government of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, West Germany, France, Japan and Italy committed themselves to increasing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy to help meet the world’s energy requirements while reducing the risks of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the conclusion of the recent Salzburg Conference, the most important international conference held in recent years on all aspects of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency referred to the agreement of the meeting that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power was a necessary and irreplaceable source of the future energy supply to mankind for both the short and the longer term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that there is widespread international concern to establish a framework of control within which the benefits which many countries see in the peaceful use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy can be safely realised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> facilities without adequate protection against diversion of material to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons production of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosives would pose serious threats to international stability and peace, obviously inimical to Australia’s interests and to global and regional security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was for this reason that in his address to the United Nations General Assembly last September, the Foreign Minister  (Mr Peacock)  described the strengthening of measures to prevent proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons as a central and fundamental area in which Australia looks and hopes for early progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make clear from the outset that the term safeguards is used here to denote the whole range of measures used to provide assurance that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material supplied for peaceful purposes is not misused for non-peaceful or explosive purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would not be desirable for safeguards requirements to be left to  ad hoc  decision as this would not afford the strong and clear support for international efforts to strengthen controls against <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons proliferation to which the Government attaches major importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is a potentially significant supplier of uranium, but if we are to play the part which this potential gives us the opportunity to play of contributing effectively to international efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime, it is desirable that uranium importing countries and other <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> supplier countries alike know where Australia stands on the matter of safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the narrow sense, safeguards are systems of containment, surveillance, accounting and inspection of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> materials and facilities designed to verify that diversion does not take place from peaceful to non-peaceful or explosive purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a broader sense, safeguards for future Australian uranium exports would comprise, as well as the application of international safeguards in this strict sense, the securing from importing countries of adequate assurances regarding the use and control of supplied <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material and the conclusion of binding arrangements to give effect to such assurances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In both senses- as mechanisms for verification and as controls and conditions for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> exports- safeguards arrangements are an evolving structure, continually being strengthened, refined and improved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this regard the Government is pleased that, as recently announced,  Mr Justice  Fox has agreed to become an adviser to me on policy matters relating to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation and safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the case of non-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon states- that is to say all countries other than the 5 existing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons powers recognised by the NonProliferation Treaty- sales will be made only to countries which are parties to the NonProliferation Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of these countries’ safeguards obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty this policy will ensure that the entire civil <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry in such customer countries is subject to effective safeguards to verify that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material, whether of Australian or any other origin, is not diverted from peaceful uses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is aware that work has recently been underway within the International Atomic Energy Agency on a new system of equality stringent safeguards to cover the entire <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry in non-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon states which are not parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regarding existing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon states, they are not obliged under the Non-Proliferation Treaty to renounce <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons or accept international safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They retain the right to use <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material for weapons as well as peaceful purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even so, Australia would want to have assurance that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material we may supply for peaceful purposes is not diverted to military or explosive purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will therefore export only to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon states which give Australia this assurance and accept that the uranium we supply be covered by International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These bilateral agreements will provide a framework for direct and binding assurances by importing countries to the Australian Government in relation to the use and control of uranium supplied by Australia or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material derived from its use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fundamental undertakings the Government will wish to obtain from uranium importing countries in such bilateral agreements are that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material supplied by Australia for peaceful purposes or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material derived from its use will not be diverted to military or explosive purposes and that International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards will apply to verify compliance with this undertaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fifth, the Government takes the view that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material supplied by Australia or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material derived from its use should remain under safeguards for the full life of the material in question or until it is legitimately removed from safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In line with this basic principle the Government has decided that bilateral agreements with non-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon states should make provision for so-called fallback safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, the bilateral agreements should provide for Australia to make alternative arrangements for the safeguarding of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material supplied by us in the event of international safeguards as such ceasing to operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the Government feels it is reasonable to ask importing countries who will already accept International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards of comprehensive scope under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, to accept that, at the first fallback level also, international safeguards should apply to all <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material, not just that portion supplied by Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sixth, the Government considers that it would be an unsatisfactory situation for uranium supplied by Australia to one country, or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material derived from its use, to be able to be reexported to a third country without the opportunity for Australia to satisfy itself that adequate controls would apply to the transferred material and that the ultimate destination is acceptable to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This provision will give Australia the means of ensuring that our safeguards requirements are met despite any onward transfers of the uranium we supply or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material derived from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This provision is in line with the practice adopted by other <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> supplier countries The figure of 20 per cent has been chosen as representing a level of enrichment below the practical requirements fora <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosive, while being above the enrichment level required for most peaceful uses, excepting, for example, some research and radioisotope production reactors, for which approval to enrich to the necessary level would need to be obtained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eighth, the Government is aware of the interest of some countries in the reprocessing of spent <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel to meet their anticipated future fuel requirements, and to facilitate the management of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material following its use in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time the need for reprocessing and the details of an effective control regime for this area of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle are the subject of close study internationally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States has proposed an International <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Fuel Cycle Evaluation Program to consider various <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycles in terms of their implications for proliferation control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s view is that, prior to a clearer outcome emerging from this current international activity it would be premature for Australia to adopt a unilateral position on the detailed conditions under which we might be prepared to agree to reprocessing, if any, of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material supplied by Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to effectively reserve Australia’s position on this matter for the time being we would wish to make provision in bilateral agreements with countries importing Australian uranium that any reprocessing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material supplied by Australia may only take place with the prior consent of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ninth, the Government would require in future bilateral agreements the assurance from uranium importing countries that adequate physical security will be maintained on their <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The incorporation of these provisions in the Government ‘s safeguards policy reflects our concern that total <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> control should encompass not just safeguards to verify that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material is not illicitly diverted from peaceful uses by national governments or national authorities, but also to protect <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material from illegal use by groups or individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We too consider that it is highly desirable that there should be the widest possible consensus amongst both <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> supplier countries and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> importing countries on the controls to apply to the world <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The wider the consensus, the more effective these controls will be as a barrier to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More generally, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> supplier countries have a special role and responsibility in the ongoing development of safeguards and Australia will be prepared to participate with them in any constructive efforts to develop a co-ordinated approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time the Government sees a multilateral approach towards safeguards questions as being especially desirable in one specific area as well as the International <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Fuel Cycle Evaluation Program already mentioned; we would wish to lend support to the development of an international convention on the physical protection of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material in international transit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy has been the subject of detailed exchanges of views with other countries- both uranium importers and major <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> exporters- and relevant international organisations including the International Atomic Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy goes beyond a mere acceptance by Australian of our international obligations as a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and constitutes a policy as stringent as that adopted to date by any <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> supplier country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, how can arguments by <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> proponents stating that only <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy can cover the projected energy demand increases be vindicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-76-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) In the light of the Government’s stated policy that it will encourage widespread public debate on the uranium mining issue, will the Minister make public the recent court decision in West Germany which ordered the cancellation of planning permission for a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station at Whyl in West Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-52-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister also make public that the reason for such a court decision was because of the inadequate safety precautions for such <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-52-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the 250 megawatt boiling water reactor at the Gundremmingen <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station, which is operated by the utility Rheinisch-Westfalische Elektrizitatswerk AG( RWE), was automatically shut down on 14 January after release of radioactive steam to the containment building. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I preface my question by reminding the Leader of the Government in the Senate that last week he indicated that he would endeavour to set aside sufficient time this week for debate to take place on the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards statement and on the Fox Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry second report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of the recent court decision in West Germany which ordered the cancellation of planning permission for a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-68">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the court’s decision affect the claim by pronuclear proponents, such as  Sir Philip  Baxter, that there is absolutely no danger with respect to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station safeguards against failure and fall-out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-68">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has no plans to introduce <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations into Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-68">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1) In the light of the Government’s stated policy that it will encourage widespread public debate on the uranium mining issue, will the Minister make public the recent court decision in West Germany which ordered the cancellation of planning permission for a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station at Whyl in west Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-69">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Science: Is it true that the first Fox report on uranium stated that ‘all reasonable practical steps should be taken to limit reliance on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator will understand that questions relating to research into <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy should be directed to the Minister for National Resources and I will forward that part of his question to that Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This debate is on the Second Report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry, commonly referred to as the Fox Inquiry, and also on the ministerial statement brought down by the Government on 24 May headed ‘<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Safeguards- Government Policy’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Labor Movement is concerned about the spread of the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are concerned that it has not been proved- indeed, it is far from proved- that the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power is safe beyond all doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recognising that the provision of Australian uranium to the world <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle creates problems relevant to Australian sovereignty, the environment, the economic welfare of our people, and the rights and well being of the Aboriginal people: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Believing that (having regard to the present unresolved economic, social, biological, genetic, environmental, and technical problems associated with the mining of uranium and the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power, and in particular to the proven contribution of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry to the proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons and the increased risk of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war; and the absence of procedures for the storage and disposal of radioactive wastes to ensure that any danger posed by such wastes to human life and the environment is eliminated), <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is imperative that no commitment of Australia’s uranium deposits to the world’s <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle should be made until- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hawking of potential future uranium contracts all over the world makes the Government’s policy on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards- one of the papers that we are now debating which was presented on 24 May last- look suspicious and somewhat ridiculous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Fraser  himself seemed very keen to insinuate future deals with France, a non signatory of the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Non-Proliferation Treaty concerning uranium, when he was in that country, and of course  Mr Anthony  mentioned in glowing terms just prior to the recent Association of South East Asian Nations talks the desire of the Philippines for Australian uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The stiff opposition Prime Minister Fraser is meeting in his tour of Europe to Australia ‘s <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards policy is creating an embarrassing dilemma for the Government on the eve of its final go-ahead announcement for uranium exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These included acts in which individuals have bombed and caused heavy damage to the Stanford University linear accelerator; planted a pipe bomb at the Illinois Institute of Technology Reactor; vandalised vital equipment at reactors in Rainier, Oregon, in Platteville, Colorado, and in Indian Point, New York; breaking into <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> facilities at Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Erwin, Tennessee; Oklahoma City and at the Vermont <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the United Kingdom, where police do not carry guns, the Atomic Energy Authority has its own special constabulary to guard installations and the movement of specified <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> materials such as plutonium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Uniquely amongst private police forces this constabularly has power to carry arms at all times, to engage in ‘hot pursuits’ of thieves or attempted thefts of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> materials and to arrest on suspicion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An attempt by even a small, well trained and armed group to take over a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> installation could have a good chance of success . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the evidence indicates that the risks are presently real and will tend to increase with the further spread of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Numerous breaches of security in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> installations have been recorded, and there was evidence that attempts were being made in some countries to render <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> operations more secure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, the Commission does not feel confident that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> facilities would currently withstand determined assaults by terrorist organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission was informed of numerous incidents when <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> materials had been stolen, were lost or simply could not be accounted for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A safe <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry would require an unprecedented security investigation and police program that threatens the liberty of any person associated with such an industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Britain, I suggest, represents only some 7 per cent of the world <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation capacity- this is taken from the second table of the first Fox reportwhile the United States represents 5 1 per cent of the world ‘s total capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Agency in its monthly bulletin  A tom,  to which I have already alluded, gives a summary of a report produced by the European regional office of the World Health Organisation on ‘Health Implications of <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Power production’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These releases may occur at such places as uranium mines, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations, fuel processing plants or research organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I assure the Senate that there is great concern in the United States about radio-active <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste disposal in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Michigan has been eliminated as a potential burial site for radioactive <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste, according to federal energy administrators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The State was dropped from consideration when ERDA cut from 36 to 12 the number of states still being considered for geological testing to identify underground dumps for spent <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor fuel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three of the 12 will be chosen for geological tests as potential sites, although only two dumps will be required to meet an anticipated <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste problem through the year 2000, said George Cunningham, director of ERDA ‘s waste management production division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The state Senate- the Michigan state Senate- passed a bill last month that, in effect, would prohibit <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste disposal in Michigan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, I suggest, gives the Senate some idea of the concern and the controversy that is raging in the United States on this vexatious and controversial problem of the disposal of radioactive <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not like <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy research where, of necessity, the research has to get bigger and bigger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that a fantastic market is available to us in South East Asia for any development of solar energy because what those countries want is a source of energy that has nothing to do with oil or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These countries do not have the distribution networks which a nation would need or must have with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot have small <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations operating because they are not economical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> power stations appear to be designed only for highly developed areas such as the East Coast of the United States or large cities like Chicago and large cities in Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> power stations certainly are not appropriate for the developing nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overseas countries which have been using oil almost exclusively are now looking at the two alternatives -<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power and coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of them are not using <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power but are reverting to the use of coal, as is set out in the Carter policy in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter what the Labor Party’s policy is or what our policy is, we will not discourage countries from trying to obtain uranium or going <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> because today we are living in the age of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> energy is the main energy source that they see to bridge the energy gap which has increased and has become more critical year by year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the countries which are turning to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy want is a reliable source of supply of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will then be faced with the problems of plutonium storage and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have to look at the physical aspect of trying to handle this much coal-not in Australia because we will not need a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor here in the foreseeable future, but in countries overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When comparing a coal fired thermal generator with a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> generator of the same capacity, let us remember that there are 1 1 times more deaths in the coal industry than in the uranium industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that when one talks about the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy age into which we have entered, one must remember that today there are some 46 countries which have <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have 1 80 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors with another 300 under construction and a further 300 planned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Switzerland, which internationally has been regarded as a symbol of peace, with its white cross- from which the red cross originated- today has three <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors with another three under construction and another five planned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet Japan, with a history of two <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bombings and the horrors that they caused, has 13 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors with another 1 1 under construction and a further 64 planned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development group of countries are rapidly turning to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Figures I have show that the share of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power for electricity requirements in the OECD countries in 1985 will be 20 per cent; by the year 1990 it will be 27 per cent and by the year 2000 it will be over 40 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard a lot about the dangers of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My information is that there has not been such a death and that the hazards involving <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors are very low in comparison overall with coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today Russia, which is not a signatory to the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> nonproliferation treaty but which is a member of the international atomic energy agency, is working like fury with other countries to see what can be done to establish international banks to handle plutonium wastes which come as a result of fast breeders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether or not we sell uranium, enough countries today- some 46 countries have gone <span class="highlight">nuclear</span>- could create dangers of proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable senators to show me a country where a terrorist group can develop an atomic bomb from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greatest problem the world is facing with regard to filling the energy gap by <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors, as I said, is the fear of a shortage of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fast breeder is estimated to be between 50 and 70 times more efficient than a normal <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation will be entirely different if we do not supply uranium to a world that has decided itself that it is living in a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor age, a world that wants our uranium and a world which, if it cannot get our uranium, will continue to move rapidly towards the establishment of fast breeders with the consequent plutonium era. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I see it, it is our responsibility to mine our uranium and to supply uranium responsibly under the guidelines as propounded by the Prime Minister to many of those countries that have committed themselves to a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite that sort of report from the Fox inquiry, despite the fact that the newspapers are saying that the Government has agreed to the mining and export of uranium, and despite the fact that the Victorian Government has reported that it proposed a 1000 megawatt <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> station for Victoria by 1995, we have yet had no report from the Government on any sort of legislation that would safeguard Australians or, for that matter, the world from what the consequences of all that might be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was said that the performance of the obligation must be fully secured before any mine was opened; that a trust fund or bond must be provided for anybody or anything that may be damaged by the mining; that there must be firm and legally binding undertakings to replace the tailings in the pits and that no relaxation of those bindings must be allowed under any circumstances; that the tailing dams must be sealed by an impervious membrane; that steps must be taken to reduce the loss of yellowcake dust; that the protection of the environment must be assured if mines were to go into liquidation or for any reason were to terminate their operation; that the Government should immediately explore what steps it can take to assist in reducing the hazards, the dangers and the problems associated with the production of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy; and that a national energy policy should be developed and reviewed regularly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> energy creates an unprecedented possibility of unintended or malicious disaster, affecting whole communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were told by a speaker today that it is impossible to produce a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bomb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Britain reported that enough material to produce 15 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bombs could not be accounted for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not know whether it is their accounting system that is at fault, whether the material has been lost in the machinery, whether it was never produced or whether it was stolen or sold, but it is missing and from it <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bombs can be produced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  President  Carter told South Korea that he was taking American troops home the South Koreans immediately said to him that uranium from Australia was essential so that that country could produce <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons with which to protect itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are supposed safeguards against <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war- non proliferation treaties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has only to look at the pieces of paper that have been torn up in our lifetimes to know what a flimsy safeguard they are against <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Malcolm Booker, a former Australian diplomat, pointed out in a speech that proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons had been slow because of the difficulty in developing an intercontinental missile to carry the warhead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is ideal for the purpose of carrying <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> warheads. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Canada provided India with a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor and fuel to experiment with the peaceful use of atomic energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once such material has been given to a country like India and she has made a big hole in the ground with it, why should Pakistan, her neighbour, not equally receive material and a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor for which she is agitating? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me quote  Dr Edward  Teller who has been working on the peaceful application of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power and who was brought out here to encourage us to mine and sell our uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government believes that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material supplied by Australia or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material derived from its use should remain under safeguards for the full life of the material in question or until it is legitimately removed from safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Once we have used uranium to produce <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power we have radioactive waste and, despite what  Senator Young  has said and despite the pious hopes he has that we may find a way to dispose of the waste, there is no known satisfactory way to deal with the waste at this moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The South Australian branch of the Australian Medical Association has pointed out that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy entails unprecedented potential risks for future generations via the possible erosion of the human gene pool because of the radiation and because of the attack on human genes by the material we produce by mining and using uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This very proper royal commission reported to the British Parliament that if the world were to continue to use <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and so produce plutonium then the world might very well look at establishing plutonium parks- areas around the world where plutonium could be stored forever and be guarded by a plutonium priesthood composed of people devoted to guarding the world from the plutonium lodged there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The plutonium by-product, however, would be held here under IAEA control and supervision, while the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes would be vitrified and buried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They included: The public fears about the safety of our <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste dump; the security threat from terrorists or other countries who might raid the plutonium stockpile for weapons material or even bomb the fuel centre to cripple other countries’ <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industries; the political problems in handing over our local sovereignty to the international supervisory agency, including questions such as whether Taiwan could use the centre; and the precedent created for further ‘garbage can’ industries in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one talks about the cost of producing energy from coal compared to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy, one must examine other costs, for example, the cost of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors and the cost of producing energy from coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are out of kilter because the capital and development costs of coal-fired stations and oil from coal plants are comparable or less than the capital costs of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In West Germany, as all honourable senators would be aware, there are areas in which the courts have refused to give licences for the building of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plants until the courts can be convinced that proper arrangements have been made to deal with the waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people in Austria think that their country may be the first country in Europe to completely turn her back on the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy because she wants to be assured that the waste can be handled safely and that people will not be endangered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the United States of America, of course, the need for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy has fallen away-so much so that the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy industry itself is saying that it is in disarray, that it does not know where it is going and that it would rather get out of the industry before any more problems arise because it cannot handle the problems facing it at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Melzer  raised the horrible details of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> casualties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I put it to honourable senators that not only mishaps in a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major concern was not whether there were inherent dangers in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation but rather whether such dangers were sufficient to require Australia to ban uranium exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our introduction to the awesome power of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> age came in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of that a lot of people in the world who know nothing more about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power than that introduction have a quite emotional problem in coming to grips with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, because if the awesomeness of these bombs, the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry- Operation Ploughshare, as it became known- was able to take commensurate safeguards down to this present day and age so that we now have safe <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation without any fatality to this point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hazards involved in the ordinary operations of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power reactors, if those operations are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to mine and sell Australian uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The third recommendation dealt with the prospects of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war, and that is a different subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Horror stories about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> radiation health effects are disproved by studies of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any electric power generated should be generated either by <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor or by the burning of coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the power requirements of developing countries rise in the future they will be looking more to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation, especially those that cannot meet their own fossil fuel requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It costs only about one-and-a-half times the cost of a 1000 megawatt coal-fired power station to put in a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station and the running costs are now less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By using a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> powered reactor we are cutting down the necessity for our ancillary industries to provide fuels and we are cutting down by a tremendous amount the dissipation of wastes, both on to the earth and into the atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In all the years of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation there has not been one death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So every time we put in a fossil fuel power station instead of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> powered reactor we are condemning between 10 and 100 people a year to death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> power stations give out a tremendous amount of heat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Low temperature heat release, to which <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy contributes, is directly related to total human energy use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that in some places of the earth where cities are being designed around <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> powered reactors the heat produced, instead of going into the atmosphere or into sea inlets as is often the case, is being used to heat the houses of the inhabitants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we are looking at the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle we are taking a mineral which is found at random throughout the universe, using its energy, concentrating the waste and the burying it in selected areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The control rods went in, stopped the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fission and they were able to bring in an outside pump to get water in and stop the heat that was generated by the natural radioactive decay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So all the problems do not reside in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, let it be stated that no bomb has yet been made out of plutonium that comes out of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You tell me of any bomb that has been made out of plutonium that came out of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power reactor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we stopped <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation today we would not prevent countries making atomic bombs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation cycle has nothing to do with bomb manufacturing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> power generation stands accused with no real evidence to say it is of any harm to the population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Collard  backed a couple of quite unreliable scientific people who have said that we ought to bury our <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste in Central Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government does not have support from honourable senators on its own side of the chamber to bury <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste in Central Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest, with respect to  Senator Collard,  that if he wants to bury <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste somewhere he can bury it in his own backyard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have designed and built a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> device, portable, using declassified documents and materials which are freely available ‘, the  Daily Express  reported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to emphasise the following points which, I believe, are too often overlooked when the subject of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power is brought up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Neither <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power nor coal- unless it is liquefied- will solve this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite all the loud cries about the important contribution that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power will make to the world’s energy needs, it will be only a minor energy source by 1985. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the same year in which miners in Australia are saying that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power will be making a significant contribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is stated that by 1985 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power will contribute only less than 7 per cent of” total OECD energy use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be remembered that the OECD includes most energy-hungry industrial countries and, more importantly, the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> powered countries of Germany, France, England, Japan, the United States of America, Sweden and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having stated these two very important facts, I wish to outline briefly the reasons which I consider to be rational, and a logical conclusion from available evidence, for my opposition to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power in its present state of development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reasons are: <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> proliferation; sabotage, terrorism and theft; and inappropriateness to meet Third World energy needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further reasons are: Waste disposal problems and related health problems; poor safety record in the industry- despite what honourable senators opposite have said; and inappropriateness of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy as a solution to the real energy crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will be shown that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power does not solve our real energy problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power already is redundant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Any debate on the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry must be in the context of total energy demand and supply scenarios. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To debate <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy without reference to other alternatives, the future world energy needs and where energy shortages will occur and are occurring, will lead to an illinformed and lopsided debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commission was informed of numerous incidents where <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> materials had been stolen, were lost or simply could not be accounted for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An attempt by even a small, well trained and armed group to take over a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> installation could have a good chance of success . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the evidence indicates that the risks are presently real and will tend to increase with the further spread of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further evidence of the dangers of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power are illustrated by  Dr Michael  Flood in his paper on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> sabotage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr Flood  listed the breaches in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry under the following headings: Attacks on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> installations or facilities; threats to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> installations or facilities; vandalism and sabotage to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> installations or facilities; security breaches of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> installations or facilities; United States <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> companies fined for noncompliance with security regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my mind, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power is the least desirable of all energy forms for them (the developing countries). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> electricity can only be produced in large chunks, and this is entirely inappropriate to the needs of developing nations, needs which are at present either small scale and dispersed, or at the most, in the cities, only medium scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> power, because of the size of production at which it is feasible and economical, cannot serve vast and scattered rural populations and, instead, would simply enhance centralised development and exacerbate the drift to the cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power requires massive amounts of capital, which is clearly in short supply in developing countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are our options if we do not develop <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this point it is important to remember that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy is used to generate electricity; all controversy aside, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power will not help to solve the coming energy problems of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even on their reduced estimates of energy consumption in 1985, the OECD now believes that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power will contribute less than 7 per cent of their energy use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this point it is important to remember that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy is used to generate electricity and- all controversy asidenuclear power will not help to solve the coming energy problems of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps equally as important, it will create tens of thousands of new jobs which the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry will not create. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power in the rest of the world can continue whether or not Australian uranium is made available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report states that the position of all governments with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power is clear; they support the maintenance and expansion of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia does not have to worry about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not be establishing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations for many years, if ever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second important question raised in the latest report relates to the dangers associated with the operation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hazards involved in the ordinary operations of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power reactors, if those operations are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to mine and sell Australian uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the overall safety record of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry is a good one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>British statistics show that the accident rate to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power workers is less than the average accident rate for British industry as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third question is concerned with the problems associated with the safe disposal of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our view, the possibility of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> terrorism merits energetic consideration and action at the international level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fifth question is concerned with the dangers of the diversion of fissile material for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons- the problem of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that of proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She said that the rest of the world could go on using uranium and developing their <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A very select number of countries are doing so but the great bulk of the world is not and cannot even hope, for reasons which I shall mention shortly, ever to enjoy- certainly not within the foreseeable future, anyway- any benefits that may accrue from the development of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that today we have heard most of the arguments advanced for and against the development of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to consider just how much chance these other countries have within our lifetime of deriving any benefits from the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry, we must look at the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Figures have been given to us on the amount of investment that has been put into the development of these <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1, of the International Atomic Energy Agency bulletin, there is a table which shows the construction costs of various types of plants for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we first talked about the development of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor in Australia- I suppose that would be about four or five years ago- that figure was originally nominated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my argument revolves around the capacity of the developing countries to avail themselves of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry, it is well to consider what that amount means in the light of the amount of money the developed countries have made available to the underdeveloped countries over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are doing by getting ourselves further involved in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry is locking these vast amounts of capital into the rich countries of the world that already have per capita incomes 10, 20, 50 times greater than those of the poorer countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So how can the argument be advanced that one of the reasons for developing the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry is that the developing world needs it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The developing world will not have a hope of capitalising on any benefits that flow from a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My delegation listened with great interest to the statement made by the Chief Delegate of the Philippines in which he gave facts and figures illustrating the very high cost involved in the building of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be very interesting to know of the reasons and causes of such an enormous increase in the cost of bringing light and power through <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy to the less prosperous countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They surely are sufficiently powerful arguments for us not to become involved and locked into this <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> rat race that is going on in the developed world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said when we began that there are cogent arguments for and against the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> debate in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Senate is debating the second report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry and the ministerial statement on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He advanced the argument, I believe, that developing countries cannot afford the costs of developing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In considering the evidence, we have found that many wildly exaggerated statements are made about the risks and dangers of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy production by those opposed to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The findings of this study tend to show that it is possible to justify on perfectly proper grounds the use and development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power in Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These safeguards were contained in the Government’s statement of policy on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards announced by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  which forms part of the subject of this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that around the world there is considerable public support for the use of uranium and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will be aware that 42 million people or about 20 per cent of the citizens of the United States of America, in seven States, had a chance to vote at referendums giving them a chance to say in their own States whether there would or would not be use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power in their own areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By a majority averaging out at between 65 per cent and 70 per cent they determined the vote in every case in favour of the use of uranium and in favour of the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A table appears at page 1 1 of the annual report for 1975-76 of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission which sets out the contributions which will be made from fossil fuels, hydro-electric and geothermal energy and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy in 1973, 1985 and the year 2000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Heat is released from the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reaction in a controlled fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No member of the public or employee in a commercial <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plant has been killed in a radiation accident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been the normal construction, transport and other industrial accidents, but even these have been less in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry, which now has 2000 reactor years of experience, than in the fossil fuel power undertakings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> reactors cannot blow up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators who have an X-ray will receive more radiation from that examination than they will receive from the effects of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation in this or in any other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we take orders of magnitude we see that the naturally occurring radiation may contribute to bone marrow 101 millirems per year, medical radiation may contribute 46 millirems per year and the radiation from the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry may contribute 0.25 millirems per year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir Brian  Flowers makes the point that medical radiation is a useful yardstick to take since it is quantitatively orders of magnitude greater than the radiation which you or I will receive from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not members of the public; they are the people who work in that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generating facility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to talk now about some of the other uses of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all we must acknowledge what honourable senators have acknowledged today, that is, that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy has been used for weaponry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that a lot of this debate has developed around the question of power generation, but there are other important uses for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power in this and in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have tests on safety in coal mines which are dependent upon <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology, measuring radioactivity deliberately placed there to give a measure of safety in coalmining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to honourable senators opposite that we require uranium for the peaceful use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy, not for generation of power in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can be made from a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor which is efficient, highly developed technology and cheap, or they can be made by a process, which is now obsolete, using accelerators or cyclotrons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say this to the Senate that with the safeguards that go with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology it is safer than the use of a cyclotron, and it is cheaper and more efficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The technology associated with the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry in Australia is sophisticated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since we do not live in a risk-free world we have to take a balance of whether the benefits we are deriving from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology properly applied outweigh the risks of things which have not happened and which I believe will not happen because of the safeguards in the industry now and because of the safeguards contained in the Government’s paper which we are discussing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the opposition of the Labor Party is on ideological grounds and it is just a pity that the lefties in the Labor Party who got this through their conference have not done something about convincing their friends in China to sign the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Non-Proliferation Treaty as other countries have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is ridiculous to think that we would inhibit the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By exporting, we may in fact be doing something to assist in the rational use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over a period of decades now we have had the chance to observe what <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy can do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> powered ship and I know that the United States of America, which operates ice breakers in the Antarctic, is interested to find out just how this feat was performed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has a committee still operating in South Australia examining <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy in that State and examining still the possibility of attracting a uranium enrichment plant to South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has flowed from four fundamental considerations: the need to reduce the risk of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> proliferation; the need to supply essential sources of energy to an energy deficient world; the need to protect effectively the environment in which mining development will take place; the need to ensure that proper provision is made for the welfare and interests of the Aboriginal people in the Alligator Rivers Region and of all other people living in the Region and working on the development projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It looked at both the world-wide and the local regional environmental issues associated with the mining and export of uranium: the issues of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons proliferation and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards; the contribution of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power to world energy requirements; the economic implications of uranium export for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power reactors, the Inquiry concluded: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hazards involved in the ordinary operations of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power reactors, if those operations are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to mine and sell Australian uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On waste disposal from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations, the Inquiry concluded: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the possiblity of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> terrorism, the Inquiry concluded: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our view, the possibility of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> terrorism merits energetic consideration and action at the international level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is satisfied that the specification of standards of physical security by the International Atomic Energy Agency constitutes the basis upon which national governments can provide strong protection against <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> terrorism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A total refusal to supply would place Australia in clear breach of Article IV of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation treaty and could adversely affect its relation to countries which are parties to the NPT. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Article IV of the Treaty obliges Australia to cooperate in the production and usage of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy for peaceful purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons was, in the Inquiry’s view, the most serious hazard associated with the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, having considered the Inquiry’s report and all the other evidence before it, has decided that the goals of limiting the proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons, and alleviating the world’s energy problems are best served by Australia agreeing now to the export of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government well appreciates the concern some people feel about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a biologist I should have preferred that there had never been developed the military and industrial exploitation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we cannot absolve ourselves from the necessity of making decisions on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy by wishing that it had never been developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that a majority of thoughtful people accept the inevitability for at least an interim period, of large scale use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy in most parts of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Things being as they are, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generators will be needed for the next twenty, or perhaps fifty years, in most of the developed countries, with Japan and Sweden in particular need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I venture to say that were it not for that sense of responsibility, were it not for our wish to strengthen Australia’s voice in the moves against the proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons, were it not for our obligation to provide energy to an energy deficient world, we would not have decided to export uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> energy is the only readily available alternative most countries have to meet their essential need for electrical energy in the wake of the oil crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One hundred and eighty-four <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power units are in operation in 20 countries, with a capacity of 88 thousand megawatts of electricityfour times Australia’s total electrical capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many more <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power units are under construction or on order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is manifest that: there is a need for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy for peaceful purposes in a number of countries poorly endowed with fossil fuels; there is a world wide growth of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry; there is a widespread concern about whether uranium will be available to satisfy these needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of their concern about uranium supplies, some countries are turning to those <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technologies involving reprocessing and the fast breeder reactor which would achieve the more effective use of available uranium but which would increase the risk of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this situation we are in a special position of influence and have a corresponding moral responsibility to maximise protection against <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons proliferation by responding to the needs of many countries for adequate assurances of uranium supplies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By taking the decision to export uranium, Austalia can slow the movement towards the use of plutonium as a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel and lessen the attendant increased risks of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time 184 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power units are in operation in 20 countries with a capacity of 88,000 megawatts of electricityfour times Australia’s total electricity generating capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are 214 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power units now under construction in 27 countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means 500 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power units, with a total generating capacity of 381,000 megawatts, are either in operation, under construction or on firm order in 34 countries around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Installed <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> capacity is now projected to increase to at least one million megawatts and perhaps 1.9 million megawatts by the year 2000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The commitment to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power is not confined to developed countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> energy is not illusory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very substantial quantities of uranium are required to fuel the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors in operation and in prospect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Annual uranium requirements necessary to satisfy the projected growth in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power are about 90,000 short tons of uranium oxide in 1985, 140,000 short tons in 1990 and 200,000 tons in the year 2000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly there has to be a substantial expansion in uranium production in the world if the requirements for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel and energy are to be met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy usage for electric power generation has proceeded in other ountries without access to Australian uranium, id will continue, in no way relieves Australia of s responsibilities as an energy rich nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Ranger Inquiry suggested that a Marketing Authority could also administer <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We therefore do no consider it appropriate that a Marketing Authority whose task would be commercial should control <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The application and administration of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards on the import, export and handling of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material in Australia will remain the responsibility of the Minister for National Resources and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Inquiry recommended that a National Energy Policy should be developed and reviewed regularly; that steps should be taken to institute full and energetic research programs into liquid fuels and energy sources other than fossil fuels and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fission; and that a program of energy conservation be instituted nationally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first report of the Ranger Inquiry recommended that uranium exports be subject to the fullest and most effective safeguards to ensure that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> materials are not misused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Inquiry recognised that effective <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards are an essential element in the regulation and control of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second finding of the Ranger Inquiry was that the hazards involved in the ordinary operations of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power reactors, if properly controlled and regulated, are not such as to justify a decision not to mine and sell Australian uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The disposal of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste and the potential environmental problems which this could pose have been matters of public concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The responsibility for disposing, in an environmentally responsible manner, of waste arising from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation in countries abroad, is a matter for those countries which generate electricity by <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will continue to seek expert advice and to follow with interest work on this matter now in progress in a number of countries, and has indicated its willingness to participate in the International <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Fuel Cycle Evaluation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Prime Minister has said, the issue of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste disposal has been examined by a number of eminent independent authorities including the British Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, the Ford Foundation and the Ranger Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of these authorities has concluded that the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy should be abandoned because of problems associated with waste disposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are convinced that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes and plutonium can be disposed of permanently in a safe manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Inquiry made it clear that it did not consider the present <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste situation was such as to justify Australia wholly refusing to export uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Processes have already been developed to solidify <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes into a glass-like material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Inquiry expressed concern that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities should be properly regulated and controlled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As soon as serious consideration was given to the establishment of an atomic energy agency to be charged with the distribution and control of materials potentially usable in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons, it was recognised that such an organization would differ substantially from the specialized agencies, whose concerns, while important, fall squarely within the purview of ECOSOC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important for these scaremongers, who have no other arguments, to be reminded that for 20 years the mining, milling and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor use of uranium have existed throughout the world and if there are health hazards no emphatic evidence has been produced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, there are some 200 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors operating in 20 countries today and some 400 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors are on order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is asking for an indefinite moratorium so that we- all Australiansshall opt out of our global concern and remain impotent and emasculate on the sidelines in regard to the great issues of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> proliferation and disposal of waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Regardless of what we do, there will be <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors and there will be mining of uranium throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I direct his attention to page one of the Melbourne  Herald of  18 April 1977, which carried an article entitled ‘<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Dump Plan ‘ by Peter Costigan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By-product* of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors-including plutonium a vital ingredient of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bombs- would be stored in a remote area like  the  Gibson desert. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Safeguards Office also advises other national <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material control authorities to ensure continuing application of national safeguarding measures, including physical security, after the material leaves Australian jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the Minister will agree with me when I say that the United States of America is recognised as being the world’s leader in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, notwithstanding the validity of that statement, I ask: Is the Minister aware of a 73-page report by a congressional sub-committee which reveals that the United States has been accumulating thousands of tons of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste for more than 30 years and that even if all <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities were halted today there would be an immense problem in finding a permanent safe storage for all that accumulation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have a staggering problem of both cost and environmental danger in regard to what to do with the temporarily stored, the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste much of which is in liquid form, you know like 74 million gallons of the stuff, which has a life of anywhere from 1,000 years to 250,000 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can the Prime Minister and the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development claim that safe methods of disposal and storage of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste materials are available in the light of that congressional report? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am continually staggered at the Opposition, which I believe has a sincere belief in the containment of the proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons, adopting a stance on uranium which will have but one end result, that is, of in fact pushing nations into the plutonium age and therefore into the proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Labor Party may perhaps have a desirable philosophical stance, putting into operation what it believes to be a method of stopping the proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons will in fact lead to such a proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the matter of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste disposal, a matter of concern to us all, and in particular to an article in this morning’s  Age  written by John Stephen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, did the Prime Minister announce that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste from other countries would not be brought to Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although Australia as a major exporter of uranium will be involved closely in international studies concerned with reprocessing and the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle there is no intention of Australia storing other countries’ radioactive wastes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he also recall saying that the Government and the Prime Minister have decided that there will be no storage of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that there is a very strong body of scientific opinion that parts of central Australia are geologically the safest deposit areas or possible deposit areas in the world for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: In the event of that being proved, is this Government saying that it is selfish enough to preclude any possibility of an agreement with other nations whereby such depositories may be declared safe for the disposal of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I have said and repeated in this place is what the Prime Minister has stated as Government policy, which is that there is no intention to store other people’s <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat: There is no intention of the Government to store <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes on behalf of other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the honourable senator is suggesting to me that because there is a strong body of scientific opinion that a place such as central Australia would be a safe place to store <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste and it would be selfish not to do so, I will certainly tell the Prime Minister that at least the Leader of the Opposition in this place feels that the Government may be selfish in not acceding to the wishes of people in other countries and, in fact, that he is asking the Government to reconsider its policy of not storing the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I said was that I would pass on to the Prime Minister the fact that the Leader of the Opposition in this place believes the Government ought to reconsider its position and be unselfish enough to store the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As required of a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Weapons (NPT), Australia advises the International Atomic Energy Agency of the quantity, composition and destination of the material exported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Safeguards Office also advises other national <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material control authorities to ensure continuing application of national safeguarding measures, including physical security, after the material leaves Australian jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister Is it not true, as stated by the recent United States congressional inquiry on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy costs, that in the United States alone over 7 1 million gallons of high level radioactive waste is currently being temporarily stored in two localities in the United States and that thousands of tons of other radioactive waste has also accumulated over the last 30 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basically what he was saying is that anybody who is worried about the storage of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes- people whom I describe in this place as ‘flat eathers and luddites’- should not worry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From what I recall, the gentlemen were saying that in fact there is a safe method of storage of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Everybody seems to get into the act except those who have some expertise in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that everybody is an expert on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy because he has a luminous dial on his watch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key to the question seems to be the honourable senators excitement about all these millions or thousands of gallons of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this recommendation is not to be implemented, does this not negate this Government’s promise that all possible safeguards in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry will be enforced in the event of a go-ahead for the industry in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is well to know that those who continue to put the view, in this chamber and elsewhere, that Omega is some <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> threat ought to know that evidence given by the physicists before our own Committee was mat a simple electric storm, a simple flare in the atmosphere, will distort it and make it completely unworkable in a military sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The change from the extended biological family to the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> family which has occurred this century and the apparently irreversible but regrettable failure of people to be willing to care for their aged relatives has led to the situation in this country of aged people too often being placed in institutions such as nursing homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the main point is- whether it is the Middle East or the African Continent- that whilst a number of countries have <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons, the middle group of nations has to be subordinated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Justice  Fox’s primary role will be to represent Australia overseas in international endeavours to secure a strengthened <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation regime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the Inquiry completed its final report in May 1977,  Mr Justice  Fox, on my request, pursued  inquiries  overseas relating to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation and safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has recently returned from this overseas visit during which he consulted more than 200 peoplerepresenting overseas agencies and individual interests-in various countries, amongst others the European Economic Community countries, Sweden, Austria, Brazil, the United States, Canada and Japan, regarding safeguards against <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons proliferation and has reported to me on those discussions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regard  Mr Justice  Fox’s advice as important in enabling the Government to pursue the most effective policy against the spread of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons, which is a matter of great international concern, and the most effective arrangements to remove the international instability associated with the spread of sensitive <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear from what he has told me that there is developing a greater international awareness of the importance of preventing proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most important is the International <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Fuel Cycle Evaluation which is being undertaken on the initiative of the  President  of the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will evaluate all parts of the present <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle with the aim of strengthening technology against diversion of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> materials to weapons use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Justice  Fox’s leadership will ensure that Australia will contribute to the international fuel cycle evaluation to the maximum extent that its international position and technical expertise in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> matters will permit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The appointment demonstrates the tremendous concern which the Government has for problems relating to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons proliferation and its determination to do everything possible to ensure the safest possible safeguards arrangements around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The reason, of course, is the right of every person to independence … we need to determine a basic philosophy concerning the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> family or a society of individuals . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us remember that in the long run there is no way of stopping the spread of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology among nations and we must face the proliferation problems that result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The export of Australian uranium will decrease the risks of further proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons … it will help make a safer world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What it is saying, in effect, whether the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions like it or not, is that we are in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government recognises that we live in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government recognises that a large number of countries overseas are building <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Also a number of nations generate a large proportion of their electricity from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last figure I saw was that in the United Kingdom approximately, I think, 30 per cent of electricity now comes from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is well known that a large number of European countries wish to turn to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations so as not to be so totally dependent on oil from the Middle East. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether or not Australia mines and exports uranium, there is no doubt that a large number of countries will go into the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> age and build <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that the whole stance of the Government was to become involved in this matter so that we can exercise a proper restraint to stop the recycling of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel, which does lead to problems in all sorts of areas, and bring an influence of moderation and sense into the international sphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With regard to  Senator Keeffe  ‘s point about the expenditure of the United States on solar energy research, I point out that in the current year 1976-77, although the United States is spending about $180m on solar energy research it is spending $ 1,401m on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I think the relationship between the amount we spend in Australia on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> research and the amount the Americans spend is fairly similar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This leaves us with what is becoming one of the most emotive subjects of our time, the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power cycle and the mining and exportation of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should use for power generation either coal-fired boilers or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When we consider the problems of the developing countries, their need for an energy source and their lack of fossil fuels, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation does make sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those of us who had an opportunity to watch  Monday Conference  last night saw and heard a debate in considerable depth which would have given us cause to pause before supporting too strongly the development of our uranium resources- not so much because of the by-products of use for peaceful purposes but because of the danger of proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There seems to have been a relaxation of their desire to accelerate the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On 8 September 1977  (Hansard  page 704)  Senator Brown  asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for National Resources, a question without notice as to whether there is any substance in an allegation that there is a proposal that Australia enter into an agreement with the United States and Canada for the purpose of dumping the western world’s <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great tragedies of the uranium debate is that people are simple enough to believe that if we leave our uranium in the ground and take no interest in the non-proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons, then proliferation will not happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should think that those who, like us, are serious about stopping the proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons, would see that if we are to have an influence we must be in there to have that influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, we are living under the American <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> umbrella, and have to take the consequences of this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Does the Leader of the Government in the Senate recall saying to me on 15 September, in reply to a question I asked him concerning the disposal of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I said was that I would pass on to the Prime Minister the fact that the Leader of the Opposition in this place believes the Government ought to reconsider its position and be unselfish enough to store the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill was foreshadowed in the statement to Parliament by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  on 6 October when he announced the Government’s decision to appoint  Mr Justice  Fox as Ambassador-at-Large, to represent Australia overseas in international endeavours to secure a strengthened <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation regime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a great pity that during the term of his appointment he will be unavailable for judicial service but bis contribution towards our endeavours to secure a strengthened <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation regime will, I am sure, more than make up for this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the contrary; the world has made up its mind that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation is a reality and a necessity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we look at the situation in Europe today we find that countries such as East Germany have <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the thing that really came through loudly and clearly was the great and grave concern of the Europeans that there was an energy gap which had to be filled; that the only way in which that could be done in the interim, before fusion, solar energy or some other form of energy became available, was by developing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is backed by the United Kingdom union congress itself, the members of which I understand are 10 to one in favour of importing uranium and recently urged their Government to expand its <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> program in order to avoid an energy crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we leave it in the ground we have done nothing about the dangers, the disposal of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste, about terrorists acquiring weapons, nothing about people occupied in the generating plants in West Germany, Japan and the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The uranium issue looked on the results of earlier gallup polls to be a good issue for the Government to campaign on, but the situation is such today as to make one feel that the support for and against the export of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material is very close to evenly divided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the two facts that  Mr Justice  Fox has reported, namely, that there is general opposition overseas to the United States and Canadian propositions that there could be no reprocessing of uranium supplied by those countries without the specific approval of supplier countries and that there is concern overseas that the International Atomic Energy Agency may not be able to administer <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards satisfactorily, how does the Australian Government intend to maintain the fictional assurances given to the Australian people that Australian safeguards will be met completely by overseas takers of our uranium exports? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The advent of Australia as a major supplier of uranium will make certain that Australia’s voice on this most vital problem of international affairs- <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons proliferation, will be heard . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Internationally there was recognition that the United States and Canadian <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> policies had drawn attention to the particular dangers associated with re-processing and breeder reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is he aware that a recent report from Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd stated that the demand for uranium will depend on the rate of growth in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generating capacity and advances in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology; that m the United States of America there have been only four orders for new <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plants in 1 977, two for tentative preliminary contracts only; and that Howard Winterson, Vice-President of Combustion Engineering in America has said recently: ‘In about two years you will see this business disintegrate’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The simply stated purpose of the Bill is to provide certain machinery circumstances in relation to  Mr Justice  Fox and his appointment as AmbassadoratLarge for the Australian Government in relation to matters concerning <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards, and to provide for continuity of service in a judicial capacity for  Mr Justice  Fox during the time he occupies the position of Ambassador-at-Large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps this is an opportune time to draw attention to the document which has already been discussed in the Senate this morning during Question Time in relation to  Mr Justice  Fox’s views of the international situation regarding <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards and proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is designed to enable the appointment of  Mr Justice  Fox as Ambassador-at-Large, to represent Australia in its endeavours to secure a strengthened <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation regime, without this appointment impinging on his rights as a judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Minister for Foreign Affairs’ statement on the  This Day Tonight  program two nights ago in which he indicated that it was not his intention to allow  Mr Justice  Fox to comment publicly on the findings of his recent overseas examination of world <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards policy, despite the fact that there is a great deal of confusion over the Judge ‘s findings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that Omega is subject to great aberration in the event of any major electrical disturbance in the hemisphere or stratosphere and would be subject to grave aberration in any <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have said time and time again that Australia must go into the uranium business if, in  Mr Justice  Fox’s words, we are going to be able to play our proper part in the world and stop the proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland have abundant reserves of low cost coal, and as yet <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> generation cannot be justified on economic grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Has the Government received complaints and objections from certain member countries of the European Economic Community concerning the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards policy the Austraiian Government announced on 24 May 1977; if so, what are these complaints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do the main objections to the Australian <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards policy relate to the application of the full International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards, a ban of more than 20 per cent U308 enrichment, and the requirement of prior Australian consent to re-export and re-process Australian uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How effective will the Australian <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguard system be if member countries of the European Economic Community will not accept these safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s policy on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards is a stringent one, and is recognised as such internationally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions for International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards and prior Australian consent to high enrichment reprocessing and retransfer are integral parts of that package, as are the other requirements which have been stated, for example, bilateral agreements with customer countries, proscription of diversion of supplied <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material to military and explosive uses and adequate physical security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to a reported statement by  Mr Pat  Clancy, the national secretary of the Building Workers Industrial Union, that Soviet trade unionists support Russia’s <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy program because they are satisfied with Soviet <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of any evidence that Russian technology is so far advanced over Western technology that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste can be disposed of safely in the Soviet Union whereas Western <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste cannot be disposed of safely? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Does the statement give the lie direct to the oft repeated claim by opponents in Australia to the development of uranium mining and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy that there is no known safe method of disposing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and refers to the incident involving a Russian <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> powered Cosmos satellite which re-entered the earth’s atmosphere during the fourth week in January and eventually crashed in Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States kept Australia fully informed well in advance of developments relating to the malfunctioning of the satellite, including the fact that it was carrying a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> powered source. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fourthly, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions and waste disposal are banned in Antarctica, and appointed observers from the participating powers have been given free right of access into any area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Windscale has been one of the major research areas on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has had not only theoretical but also practical experience and it is interesting to note that following the evidence that was given to the Windscale inquiry the United Kingdom has agreed to the establishment of a further four <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-In view of the lengthy discussions with British and Australian scientists about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste in the Maralinga region of South Australia, I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development whether the British Government has indicated that it is prepared to accept responsibility for the disposal of that waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Its purpose is to monitor seismic disturbances in the earth’s surface in such a way as to aid in distinguishing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions from natural phenomena such as earthquakes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A station in this location is desirable to complete a network of stations for monitoring <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test ban treaties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government is pleased to be associated with such an endeavour, which is essential to the cause of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation and we see no reason to keep our participation confidential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The data from the Australian station will continue to be used, in conjunction with data from other stations, to monitor underground <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States will continue to man the Station for its basic <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation monitoring purpose, and Australia will provide the effort required to adapt the results to research in earth sciences, as well as participating in overall management and providing services for the station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government welcomes the continuation of the Joint Geological and Geophysical Research Station in Australia as a contribution to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation and as a research tool in earth science. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The decision we must make is whether we sell uranium oxide to an energy starved world that has already made a decision to develop <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the impression is gained around the place that Australia can decide whether or not the world has <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power and that if we refuse to supply uranium oxide to the nations of the world they will change to some other form of energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know the break-up of costs as far as <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power is concerned, but when one hears that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power for electricity generation is somewhere near the cost of conventional type generation these days one can assume that the 75 per cent figure will not vary; each has the same means of reticulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to the extent that the ‘new agenda’- with its emphasis on economic questions, North/South issues of redistribution, food, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy, mineral resources- comes to prevail, our position will be quite different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an environmental inquiry and an integral element of the process by which the British Government will consider a further installation for its <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The British <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry has been established for over 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is very large and comprehends all aspects of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Britain, of course, is a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon state and a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the wake of the oil crisis the position is that many countries are now making commitments to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy since it is the only viable energy source available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in relation to that problem -namely, the large scale utilisation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy- that the concerns expressed by President Carter and other leaders in relation to the plutonium problem have real meaning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>President Carter has initiated the international fuel cycle evaluation to study the non-proliferation aspects of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle and the United States for the time being has suspended the reprocessing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the international concern about the availability of uranium supplies, some countries are turning to sophisticated <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology involving reprocessing and the fast breeder reactor, which would achieve the more effective use of uranium but would increase the risk of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By taking the decision to export uranium, Australia can slow the movement towards the use of plutonium as a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel and lessen the attendant increased risks of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 do not want to touch on that in any detail, but some hardship is caused by the very strict application of the notion of family in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> sense as we understand it in a country such as Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>My question, which I address to the Minister for Science, refers to a matter I mentioned to him yesterday, namely, the reported scientific observations of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> powered Russian satellite during its passage over Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Government has committed itself to protecting the health and safety of the people and environment of Australia from possible harmful effects associated with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities in Australia and as the description ‘<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity’ figures in government statements on these matters, can the Minister advise the Senate of the way in which the term ‘<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity’ is defined by the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can say emphatically that, as a pacemaker on the world scene, this Government has committed itself to protect the people of this and other countries against <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> hazards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators must know that the safeguards that have been prescribed by this country both for the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> materials in Australia and for the sale of uranium products overseas are the most stringent prescribed by any country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Will the Minister representing the Minister for National Development make available to the Senate for tabling the 104-page report on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy prepared by the Environment, Energy and Natural Resources Sub-committee of the United States Congress? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, has he heard a comment on the Australian Broadcasting Commission ‘s news service that, despite 30 years of federal control in America, government and industry have so far failed to produce a solution to the problem of radioactive waste and that this report will send chills down the backs of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy executives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that the cost of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy in the United States is climbing astronomically and that this cost spiral, plus the waste problem, are already causing some American States to back away from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power development? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, will the Minister reconsider his previous statement that he will be the one to enunciate the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power policy of our country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The function of the Uranium Advisory Council shall be to advise the Minister for Trade and Resources with regard to the export and use of Australian uranium, having in mind in particular the possible hazards, dangers and problems of and associated with the production of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy; and the development of the uranium mining industry in Australia, including exploration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian religious community; the Aboriginal community; a national voluntary environmental organisation; the Northern Territory community; the Australian Council of Trade Unions; a person with experience in energy matters; the Australian uranium industry; a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> scientist; a medical practitioner or health physicist; an environmentalist with experience in natural resource development; an economist with experience in natural resource development; an expert in national, and international affairs or law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In reaching our decisions on uranium development we had special regard to the issues of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> nonproliferation and world energy requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As regards the former, it is very clear that only by developing our vast uranium resources can Australia play a real role in strengthening <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards and preventing any illconsidered rush to plutonium-based energy systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only as a major potential exporter of uranium is Australia in a position to command attention and exert influence in the direction of more stringent <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The United States, Canada and other <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> supplier countries have in recent times taken initiatives to strengthen <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia, in its position as a major potential uranium exporter, strongly supports such <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation and safeguards initiatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For Australia to achieve progress in the direction of more stringent <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards in such negotiations, it needs to be abundantly clear that we intend to develop our uranium resources and play a positive and active role in international <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> developments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to recent allegations that an Australian male has died of leukemia as a direct result of exposure to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> radiation at the Lucas Heights <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-13">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How does this incident affect the Government’s <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards policy; if not, why not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does not this accident indicate that the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry is potentially a killer and that no safeguard system designed is infallible; if not, why not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-13">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>AAEC records show that the man had never worked on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors at Lucas Heights, although doubtless he had been in the vicinity of a reactor on occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He had not been involved during his employment at the AAEC in any accident or incident involving exposure to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> radiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the alleged incident did not occur, the death of the officer had no bearing on the Government’s <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to safety as distinct from safeguards, all <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity in Australia is, and will continue to be, undertaken in conformity with the standards of the International Commission on Radiological Protection to ensure that workers and the public are not exposed to excess radiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>5 ) As the alleged incident did not occur, no inferences can be drawn about the safety or otherwise of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-13">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A very large number of persons in Australia have in addition been exposed to ionising radiation from other sources, including X-rays and radioisotopes used in medicine and industry, and in the case of workers in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry, from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors and radioactive material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-13">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Yesterday and today  Senator Wriedt  asked for certain detailed information regarding essentially the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sought that information and I now offer the following advice that I have received: The Prime Minister wrote to all Premiers on 3 1 August 1 977 concerning the Government’s decision to develop a uniform code of practice to apply to all uranium mining activities in Australia and to any future <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my statement announcing the Commonwealth Government’s decision on uranium mining I referred to our decision to develop a uniform Code of Practice to apply to all uranium mining activities in Australia and to any future <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Government has decided to accept this recommendation but to go further and, together with the States, to establish by legislation a uniform national Code which covers all aspects of mining and milling of uranium as well as any future <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The questions of proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons, the risk of diversion of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> materials from peaceful uses and the problem of safe disposal of radioactive wastes were considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The opportunity is also being taken to strengthen and clarify the legislative basis for the application of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards within Australia in accordance with the agreement between the International Atomic Energy Agency and Australia in connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now turn to the matter of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators would be aware, Australia ratified the Treaty on the NonProliferation of <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Weapons on 23 January 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By ratifying this most important international instrument, Australia undertook, amongst other things, not to manufacture or acquire <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons or other <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosive safeguards and to accept safeguards applied by the International Atomic Energy Agency covering all <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material in all peaceful <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities within Australia, under our jurisdiction or carried out anywhere under our control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, and pursuant to the Treaty, Australia subsequently entered into an agreement with the IAEA for the application of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislative base for the control of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> materials in Australia is part III of the Atomic Energy Act 1953, headed ‘Control of Materials ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This part part the Act gives the Minister power to control <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material and the Act provides for regulations to be made to that end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present, all <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material which is required to be inspected by the IAEA is located within the Atomic Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, following the announcement by the Prime Minister on 24 May 1977 of Australia’s policy on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards to apply to exports of Australian uranium, Australia will be entering into government to government bilateral agreements with customer countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 38 of the Act presently provides that the regulations may prohibit or authorise the prohibition of certain activities in relation to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> materials, except under and in accordance with a licence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill 1978 <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object of this Bill is to establish mechanisms for protecting the health and safety of the people of Australia, and the environment, from possible harmful effects of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities here in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We noted particularly the very specialised nature of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry, the likelihood of potential hazards involved in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle and the limited extent of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry in Australia at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After considering all these factors carefully, the Government decided to regulate and control <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities in Australia by codes of practice and to legislate to enable such codes to be approved following consultation with the States and the Northern Territory, to be implemented through the laws of a State or Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will enable governments to ensure that the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry in Australia is so regulated as to afford the utmost protection to people and the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They include standards to be observed, practice and procedures to be followed, and other measures, such as licensing and supervision, relating to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should emphasise that this legislation is concerned with health and safety of people, and the environment, as distinct from safeguards, the purpose of which is to ensure that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material in peaceful use is not diverted to nonpeaceful purposes or to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have established a national system of accounting for and controlling <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material as required by the Non-Proliferation Treaty and by our safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 11 authorises the making of regulations to carry out, give effect to, or secure the observance of, the code in a State or Territory where, in the opinion of the GovernorGeneral the law of that State or Territory does not regulate or control <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities in the manner prescribed in the code of practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should any unforeseen situation arise as a result of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity, which is not regulated or controlled by a Commonwealth, State or Territory law, and which is likely to affect health, safety or the environment, the GovernorGeneral will have power, under clause 1 3 of the Bill, to authorise the appropriate Federal Minister to act to control hazards associated with the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Orders made under the provisions of this clause have effect only in relation to situations likely to affect health and safety, or the environment, that arises from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities, as defined in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, I do want to stress that the provisions of clause 13 apply only when no Commonwealth, State or Territory law exists to control a potentially hazardous situation arising from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity, as defined in this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is responsible environmental legislation that will provide for the development of protection measures in respect to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lack of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes Bill to ensure public participation in framing codes will threaten all environmental legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will also oppose and seek to amend the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our opposition is based mainly on the weapons proliferation danger and, probably more importantly, on the disposal of waste- on the fact that no safe technology exists for the disposal of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reinforcing the Government’s policy is a claim that the guidelines established by the Government make the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology acceptably safe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More importantly, on the matter of waste disposal I want to make this point: If the Government really believed that there was safe technology for the disposal of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste and if it wished to maximise Australian control over uranium which might be exported from Australia it would insist upon- not just allowthe spent fuel rods from reactors being stored in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It demonstrates very clearly that the Government lacks faith in its assertion about the alleged acceptability of the risks entailed with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an aside to that argument I mention that if in fact the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste were stored in Australia it would maximise the employment generating potential of the move into the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that the Government’s assertions of the alleged safety of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology are accurate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I can conceive that at some stage it might be necessary to move into <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my judgment, it is not acceptably safe to move into <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology now, given the other options that we have and, in particular, given the fact that the world has sufficient coal to supply energy needs for at least 100 years and probably for 200 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also mention that some of the people who are opposed very strongly to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy see the issue in terms of a capitalist plot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They say that the capitalist system is attempting to impose <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology on the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It fails, to account for the fact that in addition to many of the Western industrialised or capitalist countries moving into <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology, the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in particular, Yugoslavia and the People’s Republic of China also are moving into the widespread use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the opponents of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy would make their case more credible if they would mention that fact more often. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A feature which is common to the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy, in both capitalist and communist countries, to use rather crude terms, is that it has a military application. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the reason <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy has been developed and why so much money has been spent on research and development in those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, Russia, which is probably the world’s worst <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> vandal, ought to be censured by the opponents of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>General objections to the mining of uranium or to the movement into the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle aside, the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill is a most unsatisfactory piece of legislation to use as a vehicle for Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said at the beginning, I am not going to say very much about the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the Bill demonstrates very well just how ignorant we are of the whole question of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safety and waste disposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In brief, the amendments are, firstly, to necessitate a public inquiry before the confirmation of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes; secondly, to establish an environmental protection advisory council independent of government control; and, thirdly, to require that codes not be confirmed until after public inquiry and findings have been reported to the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the reasons I have stated with regard to the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill, it is quite clear that the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill should be rejected by the Senate, particularly in view of the fact that three and a half years ago Liberal and National Country Party senators rejected regulations made under the Act on the grounds that it was improper to use an Act rooted in the defence powers of the Commonwealth for commercial purposes, and the regulations were disallowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is with pleasure that I enter the debate on the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill, which the Senate is debating concurrently with the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Senate this afternoon is debating two Bills cognately- the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill 1 978 and the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleagues on this side of the chamber who will follow me in this debate no doubt will speak on that Bill as well but will speak also on the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Atomic Energy Act 1953, which we are amending by this Bill, gave the Minister power to exercise control over <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> materials but only in connection with defence or with a Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Australia mines in accordance with the provisions of this Bill, 1 believe that we will be faced inexorably with premature problems of waste disposal and problems associated with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people who will be opposing the measure outside the Parliament will be doing so because their consciences tell them that that is not the proper way to go about the problems associated with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When speaking of uranium and the prospects of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> proliferation one should be mindful not only of belligerent nations and governments but also of terrorists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This afternoon we are debating a Bill to amend the Atomic Energy Act and also the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had discussions with people in East Germany who have said quite openly that they mine uranium, send it to Russia for enrichment and then get the enriched uranium back to use in their own <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yugoslavia also has a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The article appeared prior to the Parliament resuming-  the national secretary of the Building Workers Industrial Union,  Mr Pat  Clancy, said that Soviet trade unionists supported their country’s <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy development program because they were satisfied with Soviet <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Russian workers were confident that their country’s <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes were being disposed of safely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that Russians were developing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy as part of their 5-year plan, which had been discussed by everyone involved in the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the lack of such information which renders the public or some members of it suspicious of those who operate the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry and exposes them to anxieties which are needless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is equally clear, however, that many of the anxieties which are felt are without foundation and spring from a fear of anything <span class="highlight">nuclear</span>, no doubt partly due to the fact that the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs with their devastating effects were the opening events in the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can see clearly that the world had decided to go <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> because of the limitations upon the reserves of energy resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I say that the world has decided to go <span class="highlight">nuclear</span>, we in Australia have had nothing to say about or no influence whatsoever over the decision made by other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me assure  Senator Colston  that the world has gone <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> and will continue to expand its <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time there are some 194 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plants in the world in some 20-odd countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to my figures, another 307 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor plants are in the planning stages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This shows just how much the world has decided to go <span class="highlight">nuclear</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet Iran has decided to go <span class="highlight">nuclear</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It already has two <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors under construction and is planning to have another 20 reactors operational by the 1990s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a country which is sitting on great supplies of what is rapidly becoming a scarce energy source, yet this country is prepared to share that energy source and at the same time to make sure that in the interests of conservation and looking to the future it will go <span class="highlight">nuclear</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Iran could easily sell much less of its oil if it wished, still be a wealthy country and not have to worry about going <span class="highlight">nuclear</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are sitting on a source of energy which the world is requiring because the world has decided to go <span class="highlight">nuclear</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet honourable senators opposite are saying that they do not want Australia to go <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> for certain reasons, making many claims, such as that it would be dangerous to do so et cetera. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a normal <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor 1 lb of uranium has the heat equivalent of some 20,000 lb of black coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why the world has turned <span class="highlight">nuclear</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been estimated also that at present deaths in coal-fired power plants are 1 1 times higher than deaths in the nuclearpowered plants with the same generating capacity and that injuries in the coal industry, because of the volume of work undertaken, are seven times higher than injuries in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if one kept travelling for long enough one would get a lot more radiation than one would ever get working in a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the risks involved in those situations would be the same as those for a man working in a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to repeat that Australia has not forced other countries to adopt the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Switzerland, one of the most peaceful countries in the world and the home of the International Red Cross, has gone <span class="highlight">nuclear</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These countries have gone <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> because they could see that there is no alternative to fill the energy gap than <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once a decision was made to adopt <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power and a great number of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors were established and proposed to be established throughout the world, a need existed to make sure that a sufficient volume of uranium was available as feedstock for those <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do not ensure this, we will be forcing countries to hasten the development of fast breeder <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, let me say briefly that  Senator Colston,  speaking on behalf of the Australian Labor Party in the debate today, has said that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste is a problem.I suggest to honourable senators who say this that perhaps they should look to what is happening in France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not accept the rationale of the Opposition that one of the main reasons it will not support this legislation is on the basis of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this way Australia also can have a say with regard to the International Atomic Agency, the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Non-Proliferation Treaty, et cetera. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we leave it in the ground, we have done nothing about the dangers, the disposal of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste, about terrorists acquiring weapons, nothing about people occupied in the generating plants in West Germany, Japan and the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the declining oil resources and production towards the end of the century there will need to be a tremendous effort of substitution, particularly by means of coal and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The projected increase in electricity demand cannot possibly be met without a major contribution from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power including breeder reactor application. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to make it quite clear that the Australian Labor Party has a policy of total opposition to the opening of any new uranium mines until we are satisfied about the safety of the mining operations and the adequacy of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other night when I was watching television I saw a previous  chairman  of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission,  Sir Philip  Baxter, applying himself to a different aspect of this whole problem of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power which, at its fullest projection, will decide the fate of mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this time when people are racing around the world holding secret conferences, when the tensions of the world are such that members of the general public are not being fully informed of what is going on and when  deputy  heads of state can visit a country for what are almost clandestine meetings, it can be seen that there is a great deal more in uranium mining and the future use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power than meets the eye. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are still using the term atomic energy, when on all other occasionsexcept in this amending Bill which is the hidden clout in the Act- every other reference is to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the scientists, the technicians and the people associated with the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry have advanced a long way since the days of the splitting of the atom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In introducing this legislation, with forethought and determination, the Government has decided to join the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> club. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are people who are opposed to the mining of uranium and the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and its consequences, such as the lack of certainty about disposal of the waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Worst of all, in the hands of people who are not responsible finally, uranium could eventually be used to destroy the whole of the earth’s fabric through the use of thermo-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bombs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my view that Australia is being hooked into international <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> politics in a way that will keep us irrevocably in the uranium pipeline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will be hooked into the pipeline of supplying fuel to the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry, to people who say that they will adopt the safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On every indication that we can find, they can give no guarantee, either to this generation or to future generations, that they can dispose of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the United States, the White House, Congress, and the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry itself are trying to answer some of the questions still unresolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plant lasts just 35 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a source of amazement to me that the Japanese people are able to be sold the idea that they can gain temporarily from the use of thermo-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power in the generation of energy when they have experienced Hiroshima and Nagasaki. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the fact that they can happen, that they will happen, and that human lives are threatened by the possibility of an increase in the number of accidents of this type in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors is a matter that should be exercising our minds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He calls the so-called plans of those who defend the safeguards, or so-called safeguards, in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry a blueprint fantasy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry and the government have been saying for years that they think there is a solution for radioactive waste disposal for 200 or 500 thousand years, but they haven ‘t found it, and one of the reasons they haven ‘t found it is because it’s probably the most extraordinarily difficult technological solution ever devised in our civilian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is horrendously difficult and horrendously costly and if it  wasn’t  for the sudden rise in oil prices in the last few years we wouldn’t even be talking about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those observations come from people who have lived in a country where the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy is going on apace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is enough radioactive waste now, enough plutonium in the United States and other countries to produce hundreds of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bombs or if they are exposed to the atmosphere to destroy hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people, so that that’s the criteria by which we judge whether there should have been radioactive waste disposal solved before the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plants were on line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it can be proved that the disposal of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste is foolproof, if it can be proved that there is a means of disposal so that the waste will not be a menace to people employed in the industry and so that it will not be used by people of evil intent for waging war against their fellow man, and if it can be proved that the substance will not be used by terrorists who wish to gain some temporary advantage, then civilisation will continue into the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that at this time in our history when we can embark upon an era in which man can be liberated from many of the disadvantages of the past we should tread very warily in the use of thermo-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I started off by saying, I support the attitude of those on this side of the chamber who believe that those safeguards should be assured before we tie ourselves into the cycle of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation from which there will be no withdrawal once we start along the path. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the Government on these two Bills, the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill 1978 and the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we get a lot of untruths, half truths, mis-truths and everything but the truth about the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power cycle probably has a better track record than any industry when it comes to accidents- another cause of concern to the prophets of doom on the benches opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my knowledge there has not been one death in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power cycle attributable to the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor part of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation cycle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That speaks well for the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power cycle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason alone, we should be looking more seriously towards further use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second Bill, the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill, is mainly a machinery Bill which will allow us, when the mines commence, to lay down certain regulations under which the rnining operations can take place and which will allow for safeguards, for the men working there and those who would be involved down the line in transport and other ancillaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would be controlling the whole process from the mine to the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They found that the uranium was not acting as it should in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have patted ourselves on the back because of our great introduction into the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle, but we had natural reactors, as I have said, between 1.7 and 1.9 billion years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Senate is debating the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill and the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am surprised and disappointed that he has not seen fit to give evidence to the United States Congressional Committee which has expressed its concern, for example, about the establishment of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor in the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No longer would there be any reason for it to have doubts, feelings of insecurity or fears about the establishment of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor in the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the conflict of interest situation to which I referred is to be resolved, there should be a separate statutory body responsible for the administration of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  shall turn briefly to the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The stated purpose of this Bill is ‘to provide for a code of practice so that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities are effectively controlled throughout the country in the interests of health, safety and the environment’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before  I  was interrupted I was dealing with the provisions of the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the clause in detail one sees that it provides that if the Government decides that a situation exists as a result of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity a Minister is given extremely wide powers to deal with that situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise this in the context of this legislation because when we are dealing with a situation of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> society the problems of civil liberties are vastly different from the sorts of problems of civil liberties which we have been used to in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Collard  can brush these issues off, but throughout the world people and governments are concerned about terrorism in relation to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are concerned about theft in relation to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are concerned about a whole range of possibilities which can arise because of the existence of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry in particular countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the book entitled  Civil Liberties in the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Society  the author,  Mr Richard  Refshauge, had this to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The security described by  Dr Flood  and  Mr Grove-White  (in their book,  <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Prospects: a Comment qf the Individual, the State and <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Power)  include very substantial vetting of individuals in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry but also in the electric supply industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must understand that the Parliament operates in a society in which there should be freedom of discussion and debate on these matters and that persons involved in that process of freedom of discussion and debate should not be subjected to the sort of pernicious powers which are available to the Government under the Atomic Energy Act and which will be available to the Government if the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill is passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very important that those points be made, regardless of one’s views about the development of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry on the larger scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In effect, the amendments to the Act would enable the Government to ensure that Australia fulfills its obligations under the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Non-Proliferation Treaty in the handling of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second Bill which the Senate is debating this evening is the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It simply enables the creation of codes designed to protect the health and safety of the people of Australia and to protect the Australian environment from possible harmful effects of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill is simply an enabling Bill designed to enable Australians and Australia to be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He alleged that the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill goes beyond the protection of the health and safety of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object of this Act is to make provision, within the limits of the powers of the Parliament, for protecting the health and safety of the people of Australia, and the environment, from possible harmful effects associated with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities in Australia, and this Act and the regulations shall be construed and administered accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to be taken with respect to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that the Government will be able to lay down standards in relation to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities which will have to be observed right throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Britain, the Department of Energy has produced a Green Paper acknowledging that there will be a shortfall in fossil fuels and concluding that the shortfall will have to be overcome by <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> electricity generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have before me a report from the Committee on Government Operations of the United States Congress entitled Report on <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Power Costs’ which was recently provided in the United States Congress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Radioactive waste is a significant and growing problem- at least 3,000 metric tonnes of spent <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel are now being stored at commercial reactor sites with an additional 17,000 metric tonnes expected to accumulate in the next decade- yet there is still no demonstrated technology for permanently and safely disposing of this waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report went on to say that in the United States construction costs of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plants have risen 10 times faster than the cost of living over the last two years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average construction cost now of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor is no less than $3,000m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the son of capital investments in which we are becoming involved throughout the world when we talk about building <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rising costs and increasing demand have reduced orders for new <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plants and increased cancellations and deferrals of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Based on present trends of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power growth the supply of uranium will exceed demand by 21 per cent or 21,000 tonnes in 1985, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agencies 1975 predictions on the growth of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power production has been cut by 42 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in fairness  Senator Lewis  should consider that these are not emotional arguments; they are arguments based on fact and on a genuine concern by members of the Australian Labor Party about where our involvement in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry in the future will take us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>but to go further and, together with the States, to establish by legislation a uniform national code which covers all aspects of mining and milling of uranium as well as any future <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further to the Prime Minister ‘s letter of 3 1 August 1 977, 1 understand the Prime Minister will shortly send you a draft copy of the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The assurance I gave in my letter to your predecessor of 3 1 August 1 977, to which you refer was in relation to the development of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> code of practice to cover all uranium mining activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that meeting the States were told about the provisions of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes Bill but not about the provisions contained in the other Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes Bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation ever introduced into the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, clause 8 enables the Governor-General to approve a code of practice for controlling <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities, which includes mining, production, processing, storage, handling, transportation and possession and disposal of prescribed substances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prescribed substances include uranium, thorium or other substances declared to be capable of being used for the production of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event, the definition of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities is so wide that many activities involving State governments could cut right across the codes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, clause 1 1 permits the GovernorGeneral, if he is of the opinion that the laws of a State or Territory dealing with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities are inadequate, to make a regulation which supersedes any State laws and has the force of law in the State or Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those regulations continue in operation even if the State makes appropriate provision for controlling <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It says that the Minister may authorise a person to issue any orders the Minister considers necessary to control or to eliminate any hazards, assumed or otherwise, to the health or the safety of persons or the environment from any <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it turned out, all six States objected to the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The States maintain objections to the amendments to the Atomic Energy Act similar to those they have in respect of the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three of the States have been quite specific in restricting their remarks to the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In consequence of the failure of the Commonwealth to consult with the States, the Prime Minister announced that he would amend the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill in a minor way, namely, by delaying the proclamation of key sections of the Bill until further consultation had taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In embarking on that course of action the Government has an obligation to the people of Australia because the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry in Australia will provide no fewer than 10,000 jobs directly and indirectly and will produce export earnings of about $25,000m over a period of 25 to 30 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another thing is that we ought to be looking towards the time when <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fusion replaces <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> fusion can be applied now in a laboratory situation, but industrially it requires heavy water to be heated to an extent of one million degrees centigrade to introduce <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have to provide this bridging source of energy, and the only answer that we can come up with is that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy is the bridging source of energy until the alternative sources are perfected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who has any doubts about the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> question ought to go to Lucas Heights and talk to people who know a lot more about the scientific facts than people who pose in the Press– <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People do not regard radiation or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> medicine as having an effect on the saving of life or the prolonging of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These create tremendous environmental problems which are not evident from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> power stations pose no threat to the atmospheric environment at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> power stations do not do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also interesting to hear suggestions that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation threatens people who are mining <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> materials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are several satisfactory methods of disposing of the final <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes, but if a decision were made by the NRC - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Regulatory Committee-  tomorrow, there wouldn’t be enough wastes to implement it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it thinkable to make <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste disposal safer than that? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, of course, is a method of vitrification of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes, and is commercially undertaken in France and contemplated by other countries at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A similar method of sealing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes into glass was announced at the American Chemical Society’s Centennial Conference in New York City in April 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If deep burial in salt formations, after sealing in fireproof,  waterprool  and earthquake-proof glass makes <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste disposal an unsolved problem, what, pray, is a solved problem? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill does nothing to protect or safeguard human health or safety or to protect the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The two Bills now being debated cognately are the Atomic Energy Amendment BUI and the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this matter reaches the Committee stage- if it gets that far- I will ask what is the length of time that is required to establish <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> diseases that can be contracted from working in mines, from processing rock and from transporting the material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take this opportunity,  Mr President,  to draw your attention to Part HI of the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill, which is grandiosely entitled ‘Codes of Practice’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Regulatory Commission should require as a condition or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> powerplant construction and operating licensing, that applicants estimate the cost of radioactive waste and spent <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel disposal and storage, which estimates should be promptly published by the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Regulatory Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Department of Energy should develop a schedule of fees and expenses adequate to cover the full cost of radioactive waste and spent <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel management, including disposal, perpetual care, and reasonable contingencies, and should issue guidelines necessary to accurately estimate decommissioning costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Regulatory Commission should require applicants for construction and operating licences for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span>  powerplants,  as a condition of such licences, to amortise the full cost of radioactive waste disposal, spent <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel management, perpetual care, contingencies, and decommissioning costs over the expected useful lifetime of each powerplant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not want people to know these things because the more people know the greater demand there will be for more action on problems and to halt the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry until they can be assured absolutely that there is no danger to the world in which we live, to future generations or to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to us that s. 4 1 is a special power which was enacted at a time when the need to secure Australian uranium for use by Great Britain and the United States of America in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons was uppermost in the minds of those concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in part because it is proposed that the Commission be actively engaged as entrepreneur, and in part because one of its ordinary roles is the promotion of uranium mining and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> development generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The central difficulty for present purposes is that they belong to an organisation whose function is not simply one of research; it is also an active commercial and political force in the promotion of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> development and the mining of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The interesting thing about it is that if we do not export uranium we will have no say in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that the Japanese are well aware of what happened then too, yet the Japanese are one of the leaders in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, there is another reason the Japanese have been so keen on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy, that is, because it is such a highly industrialised nation that the normal methods of generating power, such as coal burning and the like, have created a tremendous amount of pollution in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> power is one of the cleanest fuels, with approximately one-fifteenth of the emission of pollution for the same generation of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is one of the main reasons Japan has decided to support the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have said- our policy remains this way- is that existing contracts should be honoured but that there should be no more mining until there is an assurance and scientific evidence to indicate that uranium waste in particular could be safely stored and that there would be no proliferation of weapons or misuse of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> by-products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are to commit Australia ‘s uranium to the world <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle; to mine and sell off the uranium as quickly as possible: and to control the growing Australian opposition to uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It rather likes the idea that the sovereignty of the Australian people is threatened by tying Australia into the world <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle, which is controlled at its key points by ruthless commercial and political interests which do not hesitate to move into countries and to crush popular opposition to their commercial ambitions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The function of the Uranium Advisory Council shall be to advise the Minister for Trade and Resources with regard to the export and use of Australian uranium, having in mind in particular the possible hazards, dangers and problems of and associated with the production of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy; and the development of the uranium mining industry in Australia, including exploration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In reaching our decisions on uranium development we had special regard to the issues of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation and world energy requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>As regards the former, it is very clear that only by developing our vast uranium resources can Australia play a real role in strengthening <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards and preventing any illconsidered rush to plutonium based energy systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think that the  Deputy  Prime Minister knew that plutonium was a component of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> field until the  President  of the United States of America,  Mr Jimmy  Carter, mentioned it in a Press release, saying that he did not want a plutonium-based economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United States of America, Canada and other <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> supplier countries have in recent times taken initiatives to strengthen <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Australia, in its position as a major potential uranium exporter, strongly supports such <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation and safeguards initiatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet, if the rumours in government circles are true as they frequently are, we are to supply yellowcake to  President  Marcos in the Philippines and there is no guarantee, with his <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> stations set up near three volcanoes, that it will not blow up anyway or that it will not be used for manufacturing bombs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Australia’s standing in international <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> forums also has been enhanced by our decision to proceed with development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The International <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Fuel Cycle Evaluation is a major international initiative in regard to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> nonproliferation and the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power for peaceful purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are neither the facilities nor the requirements in those countries for the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power, and if the uranium miners are able to export uranium it is very doubtful whether they will be worried anyway about the Third World. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the wake of the world energy crisis many countries have no viable alternative energy source other than <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Already <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy is a fact of life in many countries and there are firm commitments and proposals to install <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> capacity on an increasingly significant scale so as to provide urgently needed supplies of electrical energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In Sweden there is great debate on this matter, and in fact the conservative government in that country took over from the equivalent of a Labor government, which had built <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> powerhouses, on the basis that it would not proceed with the construction of stations powered by <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a debate in West Germany at the moment as to whether or not the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> system ought to be used as a continuing system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To say that the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy is popular around the world is just not true. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the debate, both here and in the other place, government members have gone to great pains to point out the safety of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power but I propose to read into the record a list of accidents that have happened in comparatively recent times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are now 194 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power units operating in 21 countries with a capacity of over 95,000 megawatts of electricity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There arc 213 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power units under construction in 27 countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power units with a total generating capacity of 388.000 megawatts arc either in operation, under construction or on firm order in 34 countries throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a total of 8 14 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power units in operation, under construction, on firm order or planned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a significant potential demand for Australian uranium to fuel the existing and planned <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy requirements of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is underlined in recent reports of the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Energy Agency estimates that world uranium reserves, including those of Australia, are 2.145 million short tons and that the cumulative demand to 1997 is 2.3 million short tons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finland and Japan, have registered their desire to secure uranium from Australia for their <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill, the government would be empowered to declare codes of practice to protect the environment and health and safety of Australians from the effects of uranium mining and other <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposed legislation compares very poorly with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> regulatory processes in the United States where public rulemakings hearings are mandatory and public access to information is guaranteed by Freedom of Information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Even in this situation the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry there has managed to carry on its operations in a cloud of secrecy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Movement Against Uranium Mining believes that this hastily drafted legislation ignores the growing doubts, worldwide, at a government level about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safety and economics, and the massive global citizen opposition to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The presentation of this legislation is a cynical exercise which has little to do with health, safety, the environment or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means that any aspect of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle in Australia, including uranium mining, would in future be treated as though it were for the defence of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would mean that any part of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle in Australia, including uranium mining and export for electricity generation, would bc conducted as though it were for national defence purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That bears out what I was saying earlier in this debate, that some countries are going cold on the idea of further development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that I express the feelings and the ideas of the majority of the members of the Party which I represent in the Senate when I say that I consider that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy is too potentially and actually dangerous, indeed hazardous, to be used to any great extent at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Waste disposal, the proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons and the potential for terrorists activities are all possible, indeed probable, areas of danger inherent in the mining processing and marketing of uranium products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our technology is not yet sufficiently advanced to deal with all the known effects on human health and the environment of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the pious expressions of the Bills that the Minister can take steps to ‘control and eliminate hazards associated with the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy situation’ I seriously question whether that is possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I refer now to the much vaunted <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> NonProliferation Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Treaties, whether on fishing rights or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy, are undertaken for political expediency only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said that I oppose in principle the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy, the mining, processing and marketing of uranium, I want to go on to point out one or two other areas in which the Bills are contentious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst on the one hand mouthing pious sentiments about the need for consultation between State and Federal governments before codes are proclaimed or enforced, the Government has so worded the clauses of the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill and the amendments to the Atomic Energy Act that, in fact, the States have no rights at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clauses 8 and 11 of the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill are cases in point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These clauses aim at ‘regulating or controlling <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities in Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They aim at Federal Government control of the mining, processing and exporting of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> materials in all States and Territories of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a lawyer I have often pondered the retardation of some of our institutions, such as law courts, parliaments and social institutions, as against the terrific and momentous advances in science as instanced in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> field and the interplanetary field particularly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With some reservations, on balance, I approve the commencement of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry for industrial and peaceful purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill 1978 and the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill 1978 that are before us disclose a real concern although that may only be in deference to a significant section of public opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will refer only to the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill 1978 which I will call the ‘code’ Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extreme definition of ‘<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities’ is therein stated to include the mining of any prescribed substance; the production of any prescribed substance; the milling, refining, treatment and processing of any prescribed substance; and the construction, operation or decommissioning of a mine, plant and so on associated with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One will then see how this Parliament proposes by this Bill to regulate <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities so defined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The code of practice is as extensive as this: It may specify the standards to be observed, recommend practices and procedures to be followed; make provision for or in relation to the prohibition of the doing of any act or thing that is, in whole or in part, a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity; make provision for the licensing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities; make provision for giving directions to particular persons for the purposes of the code; and make provision for and in relation to exemptions from the application of any provision of the code. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So clause 9 inserts into the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill these provisions which, to the unsceptical would induce the first blush. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the manufacture of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuels and the generation and use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In respect of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and the need for a national single power to control it, we were quite unanimous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>For example, if Western Australia were to establish a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor within a short distance of Adelaide, the survival of that city would depend upon the proper control of the Western Australian reactor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Proposed section 13 in Part V- Miscellaneous- of the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill provides: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the health or safety of persons, or the environment, is likely to be harmed by a situation resulting from a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity that exists in a State or Territory: and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a textual interpretation of the amendment I regret that the States have not been visibly involved in consultation up until this time but my theme is that the States, having regard to the national character of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity, ought instantly, except as to the question of actual mining, refer all other questions of power to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Haines also mentioned that she was concerned about the potential danger of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons being used by terrorists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill 1978 purports to provide uniformity in all States and Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under that Bill the Commonwealth Minister must cause codes of practice regulating or controlling all <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity in Australia, including mining, processing, transport, acquisition and disposal, to be sent to all State Ministers and to the Northern Territory Minister for their comments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Governor-General, after a date fixed by him, is of the opinion that State or Territory laws do not make adequate provisions for regulating or controlling <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities, regulations under the Bill may be made to give effect to the Commonwealth code in that State or <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also gives the Commonwealth Minister, by order of the Governor-General, wide powers of action to control and eliminate hazards resulting from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity where existing laws are inadequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the Northern Territory is concerned, it appears that this Bill would not prevent the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory from passing any necessary laws relating to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the development and sale of uranium these days one must remember that Australia ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Weapons on 23 January 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 refer to clauses 12 and 14 of the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill, to which  Senator Wright  referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the recent parody of a trial finalised in Moscow on 19 May 1978, when the famous Soviet <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> physicist and human rights defender, Yuri Orlov, was sentenced to seven years in a labour camp and live years of internal exile on trumped up charges of anti-Soviet agitation and slander. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-The Senate is debating the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill 1 978 and the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a particularly scintillating contribution on the atomic energy legislation the other night he drew a fascinating analogy between the radioactive hazards of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry and a glass of wine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is a man who quite laughingly dismisses the fears of many experts and thousands and thousands of other people in this country about the dangers of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have your telex advising of your wish to proceed with the environmental <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> legislation with the objective of giving the Commonwealth appropriate powers to administer the Ranger Uranium Mining development in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that anyone listening to the debate in this chamber or elsewhere tonight would not have been aware that he was talking about the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill and the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill, which are two important subjects to Australia that do not figure in his dissertation at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is not the sort of criticism which would lead me to vote against these Bills which are part of a whole package of legislationthe ‘<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> package’ as it has been called. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the fact is that I do not regard myself as in any way an expert or well versed in the substance of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> legislation or the industry in itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me refer first to the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill which is an unusual piece of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object of this Act is to make provision, within the limits of the powers of the Parliament, for protecting the health and safety of the people of Australia, and the environment, from possible harmful effects associated with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities in Australia, and this Act and the regulations shall be construed and administered accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This environmental part of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> legislation is important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Executive Government will draft codes of practice in regard to the way in which there will be protection against <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before dealing with the criticisms of it, with regard to the general legislation, I must say that I am not persuaded that there is danger in the adoption of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his speech he indicated the great need for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy by other countries who have a more pressing need for it than Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He pointed out that in fact it does not behove this country to stand apart, to leave the uranium in the ground and not to exercise an influence on the protection and handling of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry basically justifies our going ahead with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> endeavours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can appreciate that the Parliament is not in a position to lay down detailed codes, detailed material whereby it can be determined from point to point how <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity should be controlled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the important recommendations of that Committee was that the Commonwealth Parliament should be empowered by constitutional amendment to make laws with respect, firstly, to the manufacture of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuels and the generation and use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and, secondly, to ionising radiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Bill itself is deficient in failing to provide a machinery for full consultation with the States in formulating proper controls of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 1 3 of the Bill gives powers to the Governor-General to deal with special situations if he is satisfied that the health or safety of persons, or the environment, are likely to be harmed by a situation resulting from a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity that exists in a State or Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I have some concern about the results and the effectiveness of this particular Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill which is being dealt with in this debate jointly with the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is being used now for what is something of a commercial operation- the mining and the dealing with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in part because it is proposed that the Commission be actively engaged as entrepreneur, and in part because one of its ordinary roles is the promotion of uranium mining and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> development generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will no doubt be suggested that it would restrict the right of lawful protest, which operates in this community, of many people who sincerely have a strong objection to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that the Government is long since committed to a course that will require the use and development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and I would not be a party to avoiding the strategy which the Government has adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless, I support the general decision of the Government in respect of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and consequently support the package of Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate is debating the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill 1 978 and the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill 1978 conjointly, to which the Opposition has moved the following amendment: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposed legislaton raises many serious and fundamental questions, not only about uranium and related <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> acitivies, but also about the established rights and responsibilities of the States in a number of areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such questions arise with particular force in relation to the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill and the proposed amendments to the Atomic Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mining and export of uranium and all matters concerned with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> development are of such importance that they must be subject to the most careful and comprehensive examination, including adequate opportunity for general discussion and debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To requests by State governments for withdrawal of the legislation to enable reconsideration, the Prime Minister has responded that sections 1 1 and 13 of the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill, should not commence in relation to the States until the views of the States have been considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The document headed ‘Uranium- Australia’s Decision <span class="highlight">NUCLEAR</span> SAFEGUARDS’ is a background paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite that, I am not in favour of the legislation which is before us- the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill and the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill- being passed through the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Senate has been debating at length two Bills, the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill 1978 and the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill 1978, and I thank honourable senators for their contributions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hazards involved in the ordinary operations of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power reactors, if those operations are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to mine and sell Australian uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here again, the Fox Committee was reporting on the use of uranium in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did so, of course, against the background that it is not currently the intention of the Australian Government to use uranium, or its attendant fuels, for the generation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power in Australia in the contemplated future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But indeed it is important to Australia, because we are our brothers’ keepers, that we should know what are the safeguards of other countries using that uranium for the generation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report, speaking of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> terrorism continued: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our view the possibility of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> terrorism merits energetic consideration and action at the international level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It went on to point out again the danger if the plutonium content of uranium should be used for fissile materials for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A total renunciation of intention to supply designed to bring an end to all <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industries or all further development of them would in our view be likely to fail totally in its purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Non-Proliferation Treaty-  and could adversely affect its relation to countries which are parties to the NPT. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If by denial of our uranium to the world for use in slow water reactors we force nations through scarcity to turn uranium to plutonium which can give indefinite sources of energy, we then by our action lead them, even incite them, into making fissile materials for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to understand that the first Bill will give us the opportunity to strengthen and clarify the legislative basis for the application of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards within Australia in accordance with the agreement between the International Atomic Energy Agency and Australia in connection with the treaty on the non-proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us make it clear for those who talk about the dangers of fissile materials or radioactive materials in Australia as such that Australia does not intend itself to generate electricity in the future from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> products nor does it intend that this continent shall be used for the storing of waste materials or waste products from abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second Bill, the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes ) Bill 1 978, is an important Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the first class documents on safety in terms of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity was prepared in 1975 under the Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This second Bill proposes to establish measures to protect the health and safety of the people and the environment from possible harmful effects of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government decided to regulate and control <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities by codes of practice and to legislate to enable such codes to be approved following consultation with the States and the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On 23 February 1978  Senator Button  asked me a question without notice relating to the siting of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor in the Philippines and whether it is the Australian Government’s intention to make uranium available to the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-64-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Philippines is a party to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Weapons (NPT), has a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in connection with the NPT and is a member of the IAEA. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-64-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that the answer is yes, but bear in mind that the overall codes of practice under the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill will be drawn up as soon as possible and they will have an overriding impact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He does not believe that there are any safeguards which can guarantee against the proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is now growing evidence in the United States, as told to the Congressional inquiry in February last, that those who have been in contact with uranium, for instance in mining, in reactor operation, and in the maintenance of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors for submarine propulsion, may develop  leukemias  and other forms of cancer, 20-30 years after initial exposure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, it is our view that the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill should be in jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Australia, and one of my colleagues will explain our position on that at a later stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, as soon as someone mentions <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy the Opposition and the opponents of this bridging source of energy tend to become very emotional about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was reading a book the other day on the question of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is entitled The Hazards of Not Going <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the AtomicEnergy Amendment Bill and the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable senators, I would note that Windscale was one of the earliest <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy research centres set up in any country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>coal, however, carries its own risks which, quite apart from the risks from mining, which might be described as voluntarily accepted by miners, are every bit as much imposed as are the risks from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that it is a natural element required in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Enriched material will be exported because there is no <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor in Australia that will require an enrichment plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in Australia have not told the world to go <span class="highlight">nuclear</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The world itself has decided that it will go <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> to make sure that it will avoid that energy crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is as easy as his authority makes out and if there is as little danger as his authority would have us believe, why is it that in Washington a congressional study has raised once again some old questions about the future of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy, at least in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one of the main themes to have emerged from a 104-page report on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy which is soon to be released by the Environment, Energy and Natural Resources SubCommittee of Congress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Congressional report charges that no permanent acceptable storage method has yet been found for radioactive waste and that this disposal problem, more than any other factor, threatens the future of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy in the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Congressional report also finds itself in agreement with a recent study by the Rand Corporationa Californian-based ‘think tank’- that the cost of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy is climbing astronomically and that this cost spiral and the waste problem are already causing some American States to back away from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>California, for example- America ‘s most important State- has rejected <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> development, opting instead for more conventional energy sources such as coal, and at the same time investing public research moneys in safe alternatives such as solar power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are endangering this splendid land because of the boom and bust <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to American sources no industry has ever declined as rapidly as the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power boom that was forecast 10 years ago is never going to happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the dreaded risk of appearing emotional on the subject, I shall quote a resolution which was published by the National Council of Churches in America, which set up a committee to investigate <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They also provided that we could act overseas under the safeguards of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Walsh  has pointed out, the effect of the Government’s proposed amendments to clauses 1 1 and 1 3 would be to provide that Australia would have a uniform code on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safety and environmental protection, only if certain circumstances arose; namely, if the State governments request the Governor-General, and thereby the Commonwealth Government, to proclaim a code in respect of the territorial areas of their States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Policy respecting Australian uranium exports, for the time being at least, should be based on a full recognition of the hazards, dangers and problems of and associated with the production of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and should therefore seek to limit or restrict expansion of that production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should immediately explore what steps it can take to assist in reducing the hazards, dangers and problems of and associated with the production of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier the Government insisted that when it came to power it said that there should be a uniform <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safety code for the whole of Australia; that it considered that desirable in light of the Fox recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is attempting to apply those principles in 1978, when we are dealing with the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry and with uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that we are debating the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill which sets out to achieve in Australia a series of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes and practices to provide the highest possible safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against that background may I say that following correspondence between the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the States regarding the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill Commonwealth and State Ministers met in Canberra on 1 8 May of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that the discussions between officials indicated that the States were most concerned about two of the six Bills introduced into the Parliament last month- the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill and the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The officials indicated that the States saw these particular Bills as raising the possibility of Commonwealth intrusion into areas of State responsibilities in respect of uranium mining and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy, that the Bills were seen as being of doubtful constitutional validity, that their passage raised the issue of constitutional impropriety with the Commonwealth resiling from its cooperative federalism policy, and that the Bills lacked specific arrangements for Commonwealth/State consultation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand however that there was more or less general State agreement on the need for a system of uniform national <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes which might possibly be applied by way of complementary legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would expect that this action by the Commonwealth will facilitate consultative arrangements between the States and the Commonwealth so that a system of uniform <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes can be drawn up and applied nationally by way of complementary legislation if that is the most satisfactory procedure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because it is important for us to understand the situationI say with the best of goodwill that, if the Federal Opposition were to go through copies of  Hansard  of recent days, it would find that the main thrust of its opposition to this <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes Bill was directed to the allegation that there had not been full discussion or cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill will mean that a national <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> code will be drawn up and it will aim to be a uniform code. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These amendments should not be seen as a weakening of the Government’s resolve to achieve, in co-operation with the States, effective and uniform regulation and control of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities insofar as those activities affect the health, safety and environment of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a national government we accept our responsibilities in the area of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity both at home and abroad and look forward to the assistance and cooperation of the States in discharging these responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that we have had restated again today the claims about this Government’s intention to achieve a national <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> code, the Government is now to introduce amendments, which we will deal with later, that will open the way for a disaster to occur in relation to the formulation of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> code. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has bowed to certain pressures from the States in a manner which has left the chance of arriving at a strong uniform <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> code up in the air. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Carrick  said that the consequence of the action which the Prime Minister suggests in his telegram should take place will be that we will have uniform legislation in the States and the Commonwealth relating to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the health or safety of persons, or the environment is likely to be harmed by a situation resulting from a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity that exists in a State or Territory; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the health or safety of persons, or the environment, is likely to be harmed by a situation resulting from a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity that exists in a State or Territory; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When speaking about the safety codes of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> practice he said that they would be introduced after this legislation was passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am really concerned about- I cannot find mention of it in the Bill- is whether there are any safeguards in the legislation to prevent a country like Japan from trying, because it relies to a great extent on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power and no doubt will enter into contracts with  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  and  Sir Charles  Court with the sanction of this Government’s granting an export licence, to return to Queensland or Western Australia boatloads of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste for burial in the backblocks as has been suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us get this perfectly straight: The Whitlam Government, of which  Senator McLaren  was a supporter, signed a memorandum of agreement for a mining company to go ahead without anything being done about national parks, the preservation of Aboriginal land, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes or anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister agree that if the Government’s proposed amendment is accepted it will effectively give the States power to veto any regulations which the Commonwealth may issue on a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> code of practice? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each State has gone a considerable way towards developing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes and practices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that what I have to say is relevant to clause 2, which deals with the coming into operation of the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill, and to the amendment which has been moved by the Opposition as well as the Government’s proposed amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition’s amendment, and indeed all the subsequent amendments which the Opposition proposes to move, relate to the proposal by the Opposition to establish an environmental protection <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities advisory council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the other amendments to be moved by the Government, I wonder whether the Minister could explain in what respect this Bill binds the Crown in the right of the States in relation to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is not, what is the intention now of clause 6 in relation to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes, in respect of which I should have thought the States are not bound? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development been drawn to reports of the findings of a United States Congressional committee last week, which are set out in a document entitled  <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Power Costs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This document shows that after two years of deliberations by the committee concerned: Firstly, the problem of burying <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste is far from being solved and there are no solutions in sight to this problem; and, secondly, renewable energy from the sun could easily be produced if it were given the same government and industry priority as <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy has been given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All honourable senators know that the whole thrust of the Labor Senate Opposition’s argument in the earlier weeks of the debate on the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill was that the Government had been recreant in not consulting the States and that it was imperative that the States should be consulted fully and their views sought and understood, presumably so that a consensus could be reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A week or two ago the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Wriedt)  said that the great sin of this Government in relation to the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes is that it has not consulted, it has not got a consensus, and that is what it should get. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have never at any time suggested that the States be given a blank cheque to institute whatever <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes they want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth Government has set, in terms of its <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes, the highest standards in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-During the second reading debate on this legislation I contented myself with a brief rejection of the Labor Opposition’s amendment which was to give superiority to the States over the Commonwealth in the administration of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the famous kit of documents on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards which the Government put out in its thousands- I referred to this last week and I shall have to refer to it again- it made great play of the sanctions which it could enact if a country which was buying uranium from Australia were to fail to comply with the safeguard obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These amendments should not be seen as a weakening of the Government’s resolve to achieve, in co-operation with the States, effective and uniform regulation and control of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activities insofar as those activities affect the health, safety and environment of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a national government we accept our responsibilities in the area of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity both at home and abroad and look forward to the assistance and co-operation of the States in discharging these responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, we now find the proposition being put by the Minister that the acceptance of the amendment moved by the Opposition at the second reading stage would have meant that there was no <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> code at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Presumably he believes that if the States want proper code and proper health safeguards in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> development program they can still have them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is beyond me how the national Government can accept that as a responsible approach to the adoption of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes for the development of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without the reaching of an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States on a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> code, those clauses cannot be activated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes themselves are concerned, does the Commonwealth Government envisage safeguards that comply with international standards? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not become the Opposition to talk about one State, through its Governor, saying no to the Governor-General as I must remind the Opposition that its first amendment moved at the Committee stage placed a total veto in the hands of any one State, to the effect that we should not have a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> code at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the moment I have a horrible feeling that if this legislation is passed, meetings to discuss the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes will be held at the Lodge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill merely establishes the mechanism whereby consultation can be carried out between the Commonwealth and the States to establish the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> codes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The purpose of the insertion of new Part IVa relates in a sense to a judicial and constitutional point which is simply this: Assuming the Environment Protection (<span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Codes) Bill 1978 is passed and proclaimed, the Commonwealth Government will be given paramount rights over the mining of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the health or safety of persons, or the environment, is likely to be harmed by a situation resulting from a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity that exists in a State or Territory; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ) Where a situation exists where the health or safety of persons, or the environment is likely to be harmed by a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity that exists in a State or Territory and the laws of the Commonwealth (other than this section) and of the State or Territory do not make provision for protecting the health or safety of persons likely to be affected by that situation or for protecting the environment in so far as it is likely to be affected by that situation, the GovernorGeneral may, by order, authorize a Minister, during the period that the order remains in force, to give such directions and take such action as, subject to sub-section (2), arc strictly necessary to control and eliminate hazards associated with the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It arises from deficiencies in the present provisions of clause 13, which require, for example, that the Governor-General be satisfied that the health or safety of persons, or the environment, is likely to be harmed by what is called a ‘situation ‘ resulting from a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity that exists in a State or Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the Governor-General can make an order, he must be satisfied, firstly, that the health or safety of persons, or the environment, is likely to be harmed by a situation that results from a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity; secondly, that there are no laws of the Commonwealth or of a State that do not make provision for protecting the health or safety of persons or the environment likely to be affected by that situation; and, thirdly, that the State requests the making of the order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An order made under sub-section ( 1 ) in relation to a situation resulting from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity shall not authorize a Minister to give directions that have effect in a State, or to take any action in a State, unless the Governor of the State has requested the Governor-General to make an order under that sub-section in relation to that situation.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Clause 13 seeks to deal in a very vague way with a situation arising from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I seek some clarification of the definition of the term ‘<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity’, which could cover a range of things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is seriously inconsistent that within the one clause the Government proclaims its intention to impose any restrictions whatsoever on individuals and simultaneously provides for the confidentiality of information obtained in connection with the observance of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> code. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia regards the SALT negotiating process as one of the three fundamental areas of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> arms control, the others being non-proliferation and a comprehensive <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test ban agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>SALT is central to the achievement of stability in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> balance and the relaxation of tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Acting Deputy President,  need I mention <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy, of which you will be well aware? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this context I refer to the passage of the six Bills in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> package- each of which in its own way represented part of the dilemma of inter racial relations, particularly the Aboriginal lands legislation- the urgency debate in the Senate about Aurukun and Mornington Island, the debate which involved the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act, the problems we have had with the influx of boat people from Thailand, the refugees from Vietnam and the Papua New Guineans coming into the Torres Strait Islands, the controversy just yesterday over the Booroloola land claim report, our attitude to South Africa and Rhodesia compared with our attitude to other countries and the outbreak of several wars in black Africa, which is now alight with wars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister recall that some months ago I asked him whether the Australian Government would guarantee that there would be no storage in Australia of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste disposal substances from other countries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask, firstly, whether the Prime Minister has made a clear statement that under no circumstances will there be any importation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes for storage in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, has the Minister seen a report that the Philippines is looking to Australia and Canada as possible sites for the disposal of high level radioactive <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I recall it, it arose out of a Press report that a group of scientists from either Australia or Japan had suggested that somewhere in the remote part of Western Australia would be an ideal place to store <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I am relying on memory, I will ask the Acting Prime Minister for an up-to-date statement on the whole matter of importing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste from overseas for storage in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources: What discussions, if any, have been held between Commonwealth and Victorian government officials regarding possible proposals by the latter Government to install a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station at Portland in Victoria? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently  Senator O  ‘Byrne in the debate on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy on 10 May devoted about 20 per cent of his speech referring to a Four Corners program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our policy clearly recognises the important role Australia must play in moves against the proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons and the strengthening of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has announced a stringent policy of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards to govern future export contracts and we are proceeding to implement that policy through the negotiation of comprehensive bilateral safeguards agreements with other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are also taking an active role in all of the major international forums where <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation and safeguards are discussed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Justice  Fox is continuing to serve our country in this important area as Australia’s ambassador-at-large on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation and safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s policy is based squarely on our recognition of Australia’s obligations as a country well endowed with energy resources to make those resources available to other countries, many of which have no real alternative, in the wake of the world energy crisis, but to turn to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy as a means of supplying electricity to their peoples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In considering exports we will have regard to the principles I have already stated, some of which I now repeat briefly, namely: The orderly development of Australia’s uranium resources; making supplies of uranium available to other countries for use in the generation of electricity and for other peaceful purposes; ensuring adherence to the policies of Australia in relation to the non-proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons and the application of safeguards against the use of uranium other than for peaceful purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will also be necessary that the Minister determine in advance that the contracts which the uranium producers propose to enter into for the sale of their uranium to overseas buyers contain appropriate terms and conditions consistent with Australian Government <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are also aware of the enormous decline in the construction of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plants in the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A recent congressional report on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power costs in the United States of America stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Radioactive waste is a significant and growing problem- at least 3,000 metric tonnes of spent <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel are now being stored at commercial reactor sites with an additional 17,000 metric tonnes expected to accumulate in the next decade- yet there is still no demonstrated technology for permanently and safely disposing of this waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither the federal government nor the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry has prepared reliable cost estimates for the ultimate disposal and perpetual care of radioactive wastes and spent <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After 80 years of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power development, technology to dismantle a large commercial reactor has not yet been demonstrated, and the costs of dismantling such a reactor are still unknown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is very interested to ensure that the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Nonproliferation Treaty should be observed to the full. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister has made a call to the United Nations to reduce immediately the stock of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons and to prohibit future production of bomb grade material for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does it follow then that there was truth in the story presented by an Australian newspaper last year that Australia had been offered neutrality in exchange for sites for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste and that the Government had accepted the offer? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is the duty of all Australians to work for a reduction of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister advise the Senate whether any statement has been made by the Prime Minister in which he has given an unqualified guarantee that in no circumstances will <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste be imported into Australia for storage in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my recollection that the Prime Minister has said that Australia will not be used for the storage of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A spokesman for the Australian Conservation Foundation claims that because of a severe downturn in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> programs throughout the world and as uranium has moved from a sellers market to a buyers market, there was concern that the Australian Government would relax its stringent security and controls and, in an effort to boost sales, would offer sites within Australia for the dumping of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst recognising the necessity for the storage of Australian <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste within Australia, does the Government intend to offer storage sites as suggested by the Australian Conservation Foundation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What steps has the Government taken, or will it take, to implement the recommendations contained in the First Report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry, that research and development programmes into (a) liquid fuels to replace petroleum, and (b) energy sources other than fossil and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fusion are immediately and urgently required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-59-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Foreign policy concerns of the Holy See under Pope Paul included: The problems of the proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons; the improvement of social welfare; assisting the development of the poorer countries; a rapprochement with China; the evolution of relations with Marxist regimes; and a desire to expand official communications with the Communist, Islamic and Asian world in order to ensure the maintenance and continuity of the freedom of Christian observance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#debate-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, many of the countries in the area have expressed concern about the environmental damage that might have been caused by French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On 31 May 1978 and 6 June 1978  (Hansard,  pages 2120 and 2388, respectively)  Senator Wriedt  asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister, questions, without notice, concerning the Government’s attitude to the importation of other countries’ <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes for storage in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was recently announced that a significant breakthrough had been made with regard to the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been advised by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation of recent announcements in the media that a research team in the United States has conducted a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fusion experiment which, for a brief period of about one-tenth of a second, exhibited a net output of energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these reports are confirmed, this would represent a significant step towards controlling <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fusion- an area in which there have been only theoretical predictions to date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, because of the immense technical problems associated with the commercial production of energy from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fusion, this development is unlikely to have any immediate effect on the world energy scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable senator wishes to know more about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fusion research he should direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for National Development, who carries the responsibility for the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition to proscribing the use of exported material in military <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosives, Australia, Canada, Czechoslovakia, France and USA also proscribe its use for peaceful <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Canada, Czechoslovakia, France, USA and USSR (which exports <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel) are all members of the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Suppliers’ Group and have signified to the Director General of the IAEA their acceptance of a set of guidelines for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> exports which ensure that such exports do not contribute to proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that Australia should play no part in any strategy of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> warfare which encompasses such a possibility, and I intend determining while here whether we are currently so participating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question related to reports in Australian newspapers and in particular reports of United States Congressional hearings regarding the development of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry in the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 23 February this year the  Australian Financial Review  simply reported that the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plant in the Philippines was being built close to an active volcano, close to a potential hot mud flow, possibly near a fault line and close to the Subic Bay naval base where more than 5000 American families live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then said that he had no direct information on the matter concerning the building of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor in the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I was in the United States of America in July this year I took the trouble to find out what the United States Congressional Committee which was looking into the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors in various countries had determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a great deal of concern by the United States <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Regulatory Commission and by the Foreign Operations Sub-Committee of the House Appropriations Committee relating to the development of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor in the Philippines which Australia is now to supply with uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me just go back to some of the concerns which have been expressed by the United States congressional committee in relation to the development of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor in the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further piece of information which was advanced by the United States congressional committee and the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Regulatory Commission was the point that industrial, military and transportation facilities’ are nearby the reactor and that a special study of the situation ought to be conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Regulatory Commission also noted that the same sort of situation pertained in the State of Maryland in the United States where it was proposed to establish a reactor at Perryman near a weapons proving ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Regulatory Commission prevented work from proceeding on that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station in the United States because of the presence of the proving ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1976 the Filipino Energy Development Board- and this was also reported to the United States congressional committee- found <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power to be much more expensive than coal, geothermal or hydro power in the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Regulatory Commission was concerned about the justification for the erection of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plant in the Philippines in view of the findings of this body of the Philippines Government as to the costs of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power in the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other points I wish to raise were also raised, as I have said, by the United States congressional committee and they, of course, basically involve the question of the siting of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station so close to a volcanic fault line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply want to make the point that there is a volcano not far distant from the site of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am talking about evidence that was given to the United States Congressional Committee on the siting of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station near Subic Bay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I am making the point that we would all be able to hear the result if there was a volcanic fault near the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station in question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its review of the preliminary site report the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Regulatory Commission pointed out: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Regulatory Commission concluded that Mount Natib would under NRC practice be considered active. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other questions to be asked included whether the adequacy of local construction was investigated and whether such a new and relatively inexperienced company was capable of handling a massive <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I want to make is that the sort of standards set by the US <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Regulatory Commission are not being applied in the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The siting of the proposed <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plant is very doubtful in terms of what I have said, based on evidence given to the congressional committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite their great apprehension and opposition, many people cannot openly talk against the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plant for fear of harassment- military or other wise ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one information drive by the National Power Corporation a Philippine Constabulary officer got angry and shouted at a Protestant Minister who asked questions during the open forum and who mentioned some near accidents in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plants in the US. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unbiased information about the pros and cons of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> project is simply unavailable to the local population, only propaganda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important point about that is that there is clearly no availability of public discussion on the siting of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor in the Philippines to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only public discussion which has taken place in any open forum was in the United States Congress which predominantly is concerned not only about the contractual arrangements between the United States and the Philippines to provide hardware for the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor but also about United States military personnel at the naval base in Subic Bay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Even today’s <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> family assumes tasks which cannot be assumed by other social groups- or, if so, only partially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That it represents a major escalation of the arms race, and directly involves Australia even further in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war strategies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-0-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That therefore an Omega station built in Australia would be a prime <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> target. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-0-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister and concerns recent statements in the media which allege that the Commonwealth Government in its dealings with foreign buyers of Australian uranium is not adhering to the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards which the Prime Minister announced on 24 May last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister willing to assure the Senate that, in addition to the undertaking that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material supplied by Australia will not be used for military or explosive purposes, the Government will continue to require that Australian consent be gained before any of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material it supplies is transferred to a third party, enriched beyond the level of 20 per cent U235, or reprocessed by the buyer? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That policy is on record and is accepted as being the most stringent policy on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No less impertinent is an article also contained in the  Daily News  of 12 September 1978- it is the early edition, the airmail editionwith a glaring headline which states ‘Gallup Poll shows: Most Favour WA N-Unit, which is presumably the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the article also does not say is that there was a downwards swing in support for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy over that same period from June 1977, when there was 24 per cent support, to August 1 978 when there was only 22 per cent support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reports appear to reflect a misinterpretation of a study the United States has been making of the possibility of establishing regional repositories for spent <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to the uranium supplied by Australia, the Prime Minister in his statement in the House on 24 May 1977 said that provision would be made in bilateral agreements with countries wishing to import Australian uranium to ensure that any <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material we export for peaceful purposes under new contracts can only be reprocessed if Australia is fully satisfied as to the arrangements and conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-5">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is in order to reserve effectively Australia ‘s position on the details of conditions under which we may be prepared to agree to reprocessing while current international studies, including the International <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Fuel Cycle Evaluation, are underway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members opposite will stir up the trade union movement, the academics and anybody else to try to frustrate the Government’s desire to develop uranium in the interest of this nation and in the interests of people in other parts of the world who are working to proceed with the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the event of a major catastrophe occurring in one of Australia’s major cities or provincial areas such as the crash of a satellite or even a minor <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> accident, is the Government satisfied that our civic and military defence mechanisms could cope with the consequences? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a confrontation with a foreign power, even if a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> warhead aimed in that general direction scored a bull’s eye hit on the facility itself, the town of Alice Springs would still be wiped out and quite a number of miles of the surrounding countryside would be devastated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Defence, his Department and the Government ought to take a serious look at the whole operation at Pine Gap and make a clear cut public statement admitting that it is a possible <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> target or even a target for conventional weapons should an air armada come in from the north of Australia or from any other pan of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a fact that the Government, through the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, has communicated with the British Government and, indeed, has sent a telegram to the British Foreign Secretary,  Dr Owen,  requesting urgent consultations about the plutonium buried at Maralinga following the British <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> testing program there in the 1950s and 1960s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator Bishop  will know, under the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation agreements governments have a duty to report the presence of discrete masses of plutonium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Deputy Prime Minister project on his return from the Philippines in August (the  Courier Mail  10 August 1978) that more countries ‘would follow Finland, the Philippines and the United States and sign <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards agreements with Australia’; if so, to which countries was the Minister referring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-65-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 13 September 1978  (Hansard,  page 527)  Senator Missen  asked me, as Minister representing the Prime Minister, a question without notice concerning Australia’s <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-65-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards policy remains as announced by the Prime Minister on 24 May 1 977 and has not changed in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-65-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A number of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> scientists (e.g. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>More than 75 per cent of doctors and scientists working in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> medicine have however, urged the government to adopt caution and to have a “full and public debate”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does this mean there is now in office in Sweden a predominantly Labour government dedicated to making Sweden the world’s most advanced nation in harnessing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My attention has been drawn to a recent article in the Melbourne  Sun News-Pictorial  which does suggest that there has been a complete reversal of the policy of the Swedish Government with respect to the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Furthermore, no removal of the buried material from the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test area of the 1950s, with a view to reburial is contemplated at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it appears to us that research into <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> activity or whatever the field of research may be at the moment, is a particularly urgent matter and that some report is needed as to their social consequences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia does not, of course, recognise the so-called ‘ Republic of China Government’ on Taiwan and could not therefore enter into a government-to-government agreement on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards with Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Mr Chu  is reported to have said, the Taiwan Power Company currently purchases its <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel from the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> material in Taiwan is subject to International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States’ requirements as to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards are similar to Australia’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important difference in the two countries’ policies as far as they affect the supply of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material to Taiwan has very little to do with safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that the United States, unlike Australia, recognises the ‘Republic of China Government’ and is therefore able to have a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> co-operation safeguards agreement with it and to export <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material to Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, its main reason for existence is to maintain reliable communications with submarines of the US fleet serving in this area of the world (i.e., the Indian and Western Pacific Oceans)’- and, in particular, ‘to provide communication for the US Navy’s most powerful deterrent force- the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> powered ballistic missile submarine’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister will be aware that opponents of the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power for the purpose of energy generation have alleged that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation is more costly than power generated from conventional sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that the latest annual report of the Atomic Energy Authority in the United Kingdom states that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations generated electric power 35 per cent more cheaply than coal fired power stations and 50 per cent more cheaply than oil fired power stations, with 16 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations providing more than 15 per cent of the United Kingdom’s electric power needs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Senate must be indebted to him for providing such particularly interesting and valuable information in relation to the respective costs of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation and power generation by conventional sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly will refer the information that was contained in the question to the Minister for National Development whom I represent here because I am sure that he will be as interested in the material that is supplied in that report as I am and as I am sure honourable senators on this side are interested, even though the Opposition seems to be determined to fly in the face of all facts in relation to the question of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power and the development of uranium resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask whether I am correct in stating that  Senator Sim’s  question clearly spelt out that the United Kingdom intends to Start building another three <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors in England this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware of the details of development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it is a well known fact that the necessity for development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations in Europe is clear, and European countries have been relying on the development of such stations for some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for National Development, relates to the answer that he gave earlier today to a question asked by  Senator Sim  about the cost of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the assertion in his answer that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power is in fact competitive with other fuels take into account two factors- firstly, the cost, which apparently is very high, of the demolition of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations past their useful life and, secondly, the cost of the permanent and safe disposal of radioactive waste resulting from both the operation and the demolition of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the early 1 950s we were preparing- urged by Winston Churchill, who felt that war was imminent- for a nonnuclear war as one of an alliance against Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons rendered this strategy no longer credible our strategy shifted to the possibility of a limited non-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war with China as part of the South East Asia Treaty Organisation alliance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of the Senate to a fact that we must consider soon, namely, that any future submarines we order will have to be <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> powered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What proportion of electric power needs are met from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations in those countries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask that when the comparisons between the costs of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> generated electricity and the costs of other sources of electric power sought by  Senator Sim  today are supplied, such costs include realistic estimates for the dismantling of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power houses at the end of their useful life, and storage of radioactive materials resulting from such dismantling during the necessary time spans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One notices in particular in this respect that the Ranger agreement itself and the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards agreements which have now been entered into with the Philippines and Finland have all been finalised without the advice of the Uranium Advisory Council or the scrutiny by that Council of the proposed terms of the agreements in question- this, despite the various problems that have emerged and the many criticisms that have been made in relation to the method of reaching these respective agreements, and their content. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that, if the Government were as genuinely concerned about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safety and environmental responsibility as it purports to be, this would be an absolute priority area for its attention and would be at the top of its priority list in terms of additional staff rather than as shown here, apparently at the bottom, and one of the first areas to be adversely affected by the operation of the present staff ceilings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a creature of the Government’s public relations machine rather than something which has any obvious useful role to play in either the formulation or implementation of Australian <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> policy in the very sensitive safeguards area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has a present staff of four people and that apparently is not proposed to be increased in any way in the present financial year notwithstanding that we have been led by Government publicity on this subject to anticipate that that agency would have an absolutely essential and strategic role in the formulation and implementation of the Government’s <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This involves a binding undertaking not to manufacture <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons or other <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosive devices and the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards on the Republic of Korea’s <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry to verify that material is not diverted from peaceful uses to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons or other <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosive devices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the Senate that in recent years there has been a very considerable tightening of the nonproliferation controls which <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> supplier countries have imposed on exports of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> materials and equipment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The stringency of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards policy adopted by Australia reflects these concerns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has had considerable administrative experience within the Government bureaucracy, was Atomic Energy Adviser to the High Commissioner in London for three years and has served on a number of international panels and committees concerned with the environmental and public health aspects of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-71-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is a member of Committee 4 ofthe International Commission on Radiological Protection,  Chairman  of the Committee on Radiological Protection and Public Health of the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Energy Agency of the OECD and  Chairman  of an ad hoc committee of this Committee concerned with the environmental and public health implications of uranium mining and milling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-71-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Science in too many Australian eyes means herbicides deforming unborn babies or <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors destroying mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us by all means argue the great concerns of our lives, such as the preservation of the environment or the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> generation of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are dealing, in the case of uranium mining, with perhaps not a very dangerous process; but in dealing with the development of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry generally we are dealing with a dangerous process which is a cause of concern to nations and communities throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That might well mean, for example, if a different view is developed in this country on the whole question of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle, the disposal of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor waste, and so on, that no steps could be taken in relation to this authority to mine which would alter the conditions that are now in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third main objection is that .governments should at all times have the authority to order the cessation of uranium mining, based on considerations of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> proliferation, including the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> non-proliferation Treaty which we have signed and some of the countries to which we have arranged to sell uranium have signed but are clearly not abiding by. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad that the Commonwealth Government has seen fit to give stability of arrangement to mining companies involved in the consortium that is developing Ranger so that it can get on with the job and generate both employment and revenue, and as well supply a material that is basic to the requirements of a world that has turned <span class="highlight">nuclear</span>- not at our request but of necessity and as a result of its own decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that no amendment can save the basic impropriety of using an Act which was formulated in the early 1950s to deal with a completely different defence situation, namely, the exploitation of the Rum Jungle deposits in order to aid the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons programs of our allies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that means exist for the safe storage of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes through the necessary timespan of many thousands of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second criterion in our policy is that the means exist to guarantee that plutonium created in such profusion as a by-product of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry is not diverted to the making of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bombs by irresponsible governments or criminal elements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third element of our policy is that in the light of these requirements the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry is economic when compared with other sources of electric power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These matters relate directly to the very basis of consideration of this Bill which I see as being the flexibility in decision-making in the future in the whole area of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power and the export of uranium so that the decisions may quickly and readily be taken in accordance with the wishes of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The future viability of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry becomes a matter for deep concern in any consideration of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Australian Democrats are satisfied that the first requirement we have set down in our policy, that is the safe storage of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes, has not yet been met although in some small ways some progress has been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We await with interest the final costing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste disposal, especially that created by the closing down and dismantling of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This aspect in itself indicates the necessity for policies concerning the whole area of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy to be as free and open as possible in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As some honourable senators would know, some of the world’s first <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power reactors are due for close-down and disposal, yet no satisfactory means of doing this has yet been worked out other than at enormous cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ships with whole cargoes of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material have gone missing in mysterious circumstances and it has been reasonably established that there is already existing in the world a black market for plutonium which serves very willing buyers at very high prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As experience in the more advanced <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> countries is showing, these prime factors of waste disposal and control are tending to make <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power uneconomic, quite apart from any moral, safety or environmental considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the productive lifetime of reactors is shorter than was once hoped in the days when we believed that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power was to be the great hope of tomorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These cost factors are, of course, the basic reason why most of the advanced Western nations are now not carrying out the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> programs that they projected a decade ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was the view that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power would provide cheap and safe energy throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Japan, which expected to have a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power capacity of 60,000 megawatts by 1985, now seems likely to have barely one-third of that amount- about 21,000 megawatts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can any attempt to perpetuate the uranium mining industry through legislative means be justified in circumstances in which there has been an actual decline in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power production and when there is recognition, as there is in the State of California, that it is necessary for societies to live without <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of introducing these amendments the Government should be considering the fact that the nations which are now seeking <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power houses and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuels are of a quite different and more alarming type. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These nations also are places where economic conditions are not so good as to guarantee the kind of adequate spending on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> installations that would ensure maximum safety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is true that the low rate of mishap associated with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power houses over the last two decades has been due in no small part to the fact that it is the highly developed nations technologically, such as the United States, West Germany and Japan, amongst others, which have built and maintained the reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately the nations now wanting reactors and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel are also places in which, because of their autocratic governments, dissident movements exist- dissident movements which already have shown themselves to be so desperate that they would seize any possible opportunity for violent revolt, or merely the chance of attracting world publicity to themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely we can see in this situation a danger to the whole world in the spread of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power or the attempt to promote it artificially as this legislation attempts to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting and relevant because Australia already has made commitments to supply it with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel will be used at the first Filipino power reactor located quite close to Manila. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s actually documented- I’m not just saying this off the top of my head- that this <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plant is on an earthquakeprone zone, that the reactor is quite close to a fault zone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should recognise that the Act is unduly repressive because it relates purely to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power, the science of which is now so well and so openly known as to require quite different provisions which separate completely the power generation area from the military area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government does not seem to realise that this is cloud cuckoo land where <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy is concerned; there is no El Dorado for Australia in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Export of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuels may make some money for a few interests, many of which are foreign, but the effect on the nation at large will be negligible, as the first Ranger report indicated, clearly enough I should have thought, for everybody to understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not my own personal view; it has been stated repeatedly by <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> scientists in the United States who have pleaded with their Government to intervene and try to persuade the Marcos family, which is dominating ownership and control of this reactor, to move the reactor to a safer area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At one stage the Australian Labor Party did support the mining of uranium but it was not then aware of the dangers and the difficulties attached to the use of uranium and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Overseas the production of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations has been drastically cut; the use of electricity from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power has been drastically cut. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In America, the General Electric company said that halfway through this century it was faced with the greatest disaster, so far as the production of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plants was concerned, that it had ever been faced with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>‘There will be no <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> future’, it said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Energy Commission in America said that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power was finished; it was gone; it was over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Japan- the customer most lauded by this Government and the country that in the 1970s, at the height of the furore about the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy, proposed the installation of 60,000 megawatts of generating capacity by 1985- now says that it will have no more than 26,000 megawatts by 1985, and it may not even reach that because of the sharp contraction in the growth rate, the drop in demand for electricity and public opposition to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the overriding reasons all over the world is the cost of the building and disposal of those <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Soaring costs of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power projects far beyond the originally estimated limit have led to great difficulties, disappointments, controversies and even to the cancellation of projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has happened also amongst countries with some experience in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears to be even more difficult for inexperienced countries and companies to control the costs of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> project unless they buy a standard <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> unit from an experienced supplier, which means little participation of their local manufacturing and engineering capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fox said in his report that it had to be acknowledged that the mining of uranium could lead to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just lately, at the same time as this Government was announcing that it had initialled an agreement to sell uranium to South Korea, the South Korean Press came out and pointed out that South Korea had the equipment, it had the warheads and it had the equipment to transport the warheads; and that all it needed was the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> warheads and it was then in the race with other larger and stronger powers in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a country like South Korea is now talking about adding <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> warheads to the equipment it already has- and it signed the nonproliferation treaty- what are we going to do about a country like India that has not signed the non-proliferation treaty? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As he said, we live in a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> age in which the technology of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power production has outstripped our capacity to get rid of the radioactive wastes that reactors produce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer, for instance, to the text of Australia’s Model Bilateral <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Safeguards Agreement, and to the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs entitled ‘Australia and Papua New Guinea: Negotiations on Maritime Boundaries and on Other Matters Relating to Torres Strait. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer the honourable senator to the reply given by the Minister for Trade and Resources in answer to a question without notice on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy on 19 October 1978 (House of Representatives,  Hansard,  page 2073) and the reply given by the Minister for National Development in answer to Question No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-110-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The resources of the Policy Planning Section in the Department have been depleted to cover commitments in newer areas such as the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does this mean there is now in office in Sweden a predominantly Labour government dedicated to making Sweden the world ‘s most advanced nation in harnessing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-11">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example, on 2 1 October 1964 he constructed a scenario of the Chinese sending a merchant ship with a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon in it into some foreign harbour, then blackmailing that country with Chinese <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This does not preclude the possibility of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> strike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know people say that a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> strike in that area is unthinkable, but I put it to honourable senators that the scenario is there at the moment and a miscalculation could lead to one occurring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The great fear we all have is that one nation or another will make such a mistake as to think it can win a war based on the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> armaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That could be attained through a very quick and relatively easy strike, but might of course risk the return of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons on the part of China if such an attempt were made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A silent implacable killer, the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> submarine can remain undetected until the very moment it strikes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Dr O’Neill: Well if Australia was to be involved in some sort of global <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> exchange the main ways in which we would be drawn in is through the American installations that are on Australian soil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is very handy, of course, if the nation is about to be wiped out by two or three <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bombs! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that there are some reasons for querying whether we are stuck with the notion of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> family as the most natural and desirable group unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Institute should explore a great variety of factors which bear on the desirability of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> family which I think most historians and sociologists would say is a sort of bastard child of the industrial revolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The organisation and formulation of government policies- I make this comment irrespective of party lines- which bear on the family situation are very much structured towards encouraging the continuance of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> family and against the possibility of encouraging wider and more supportive relationships in families which involve more than just a husband, a wife and two children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One reads in Chinese literature and hears from Chinese diplomats- and this is in line with the Maoist theory- that even in the event of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war China would kill 200 million of the 230 million Russians and Russia would kill 200 million Chinese but China would still have 800 million people left. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Peace Liaison Committee believes that the Chinese invasion of Vietnam contains great dangers for world peace and heightens the possibility of a world <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This means that each Trident submarine will be able to destroy 408 targets, each with a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> blast about five times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This will place Australia in the front line of any <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> exchange between the US and either the Soviet Union or China . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I spoke of my own fear- I do not doubt the fear of other Australians- at being a prime target in a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> strategy, because if we engage in a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war that war will take place in a selective way with the major powers picking off odd targets in order to show their determination to carry it through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, it put into that struggle every sophisticated weapon that could be used in land warfare short of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> warfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another of the findings of that Committee relates to the safety of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry and uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After 30 years of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power development, technology to dismantle a large commercial reactor has not yet been demonstrated, and the costs of dismantling such a reactor are still unknown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Federal Government spent only a small portion of what it has already spent on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power development for the commercialisation of solar power, solar generated electricity would be economically competitive within five years, in the view of many experts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> plants are capital-intensive and thus produce few jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Renewable energy sources such as solar and conservation are not capital-intensive, and are expected to produce many jobs- 500,000 construction jobs for solar hot water installation alone- or three dmes as many jobs as produced by the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been clear for years that there is a downturn in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>American manufacturers of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors are in deep trouble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Howard M. Winterson, a vicepresident at Combustion Engineering, one of the main American manufacturers in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry, is quoted as saying some 15 months ago in 1977: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pressure on Australia to take back <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste as a condition of sales will be much stronger in this new market situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Representatives of the Japanese, United States and Philippines <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industries have already suggested in public comments that Australia is a good site to dump <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a tight financial position the companies will be able to force this Government, which is a willing and able Government, to accede to the demands of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry, to accept weaker environmental and social controls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This uranium could be used in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a world in which the rights of citizens, the rights of minority groups, the rights of any organisation and any element in society are subdued by military force and, most importantly, a world in which there is no question of dissent, no check, as occurs in our society, on what might be going on so that once those countries have a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry it will be impossible for the outside world, much less their own people, to know or influence just what is going on in those places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that there are nations which have been shown to be lacking in responsibility as far as world peace is concerned and who have the money and the determination to obtain the plutonium which is the inevitable product of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry and which is also the major ingredient of dirty forms of atomic bombs in terms of fallout. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I predict with confidence that a proportion of the 9,000 tonnes we propose to export will find their final use in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the major Western powers are ending or severely restricting their commitment to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power because of the virtual impossibility of long term storage of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste at acceptable cost, the basic expense of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power, which makes it no longer economic in comparison with other sources, the shorter life of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power houses than was once supposed, and the great cost of actually disposing of plants that have passed their useful life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor does is produce electric power, but what will we use the electric power for? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the desire of the Government that we should have a great boom economy based on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power, even if it were possible, at the expense of running out of these resources so that our great great grandchildren will have nothing left and will look back on our generation with contempt as the looters, the people who did not think for the future, the Huns of the 20th century in terms of exploitation, deprivation and the destruction of our resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This move against <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power by responsible nations is absolutely beyond doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The customers now are the less responsible nations, those who are not prepared to give the guarantees, those who are not prepared to have safe and reliable engineering, and I would concede that safe and reliable engineering has kept <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power free from a major accident for nearly three decades. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are in many cases not so much interested in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power for the benefit of their people as they are in the accumulation of plutonium to make dirty <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons with which to attack or terrorise their neighbours or perhaps even their own people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As in the case of the Philippines, there is small evidence indeed of any concern to protect their own nationals from the evil consequences of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> accident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the future <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power will be directed towards the development of other nations and the well-being of their people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Acceptance of the Agreement on an International Energy Program and decisions of the Governing Board of the IEA is to the extent that these are compatible with Australia’s Federal constitution and our policies on foreign investment, the development, export and marketing of uranium, including our policies with regard to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> nonproliferation and our policies with regard to the export of other energy resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This reflects not only on the medical use of X-rays, but also on the safety of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry which this Government has so irresponsibly presented as being safe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accept the fact that there are members of this Government who are concerned about public health, but if this Government is concerned about the safety of Australian medical service recipients, or the safety of those sections of the global community exposed to the growing radiations from the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry, it should have acted already in response to the growing international concern about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> radiation generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, and most recently there is an 800-page draft report of a committee formed last May by  President  Carter of the United States, in response to higher cancer rates amongst those living near <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> facilities and bomb sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to make reference to people like Professor Manucso and Drs Stewart and Kneale who have made extensive studies of cancers amongst workers at the United States Hanford <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> facility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if we are really concerned- and I would suggest that the Senate standing committee is concerned in its report on cancer- we should be concerned about the suggestion that there is a significant increase in cancer of up to 450 per cent amongst workers at the Portsmouth <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> submarine building facility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we must add to that the fact that,  during the currency of and after the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bomb tests in the Pacific, there was a very heavy atomic fallout in many parts of north Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A doctor, who condemned me in 1966 and said that I did not know what I was talking about when I spoke out about the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bomb tests fallout, only a year of two ago stated publicly, whilst not admitting that I had made the original statement, that the tests might be responsible for birth abnormalities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This base is already a target in any <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war because of its existing function of communicating with Polaris submarines in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assert, firstly, that we cannot fight back against <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons; nor can we, in the foreseeable future, ever hope to do so in a major sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this same conference, a police chief warned of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> blackmail and that terror was moving closer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Explain to them the danger of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war and how the unions want the uranium kept in the ground so that their future may be safe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But remember some of the monumental failures: The first <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> bomb test by the USSR in 1 949. was unexpected; the North Korean attack across the 38th parallel, in June 1 9S0, was a surprise, as was the later Chinese communist intervention; and the Bay of Pigs expedition by the CIA against Cuba in 1961 was an intelligence failure, in both senses of the word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On 23 November last, more than four months ago, I raised matters concerning the inherent safety of the proposed <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor being built near Manila in the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government has not checked these things, will it do so immediately in view of the implications of the Harrisburg <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> accident? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which concerns the Harrisburg <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plant and the general public concern about it expressed in most countries, is directed to two Ministers- the Minister for Science and the Environment, who of course would be concerned about this matter, and the Minister representing the Minister for National Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They include <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons, which have led to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> diplomacy; resistance tactics, which became guidelines for fanatics and terrorists; psychological warfare, leading to disinformation activities; and intelligence agencies involved in covert activities threatening the people and the nations and the principles that those agencies were created to defend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to raise a matter in the adjournment debate which has not been discussed in this chamber today, although it has been discussed in another place, and that is the cause of the near tragedy at Three Mile Island, Harrisburg, and the problems associated with the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So those people who have been trying to convince the Australian people- and I am talking now about the so-called pro-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> experts- over a long period that it is for the good of this country that we should mine our uranium are probably amongst the minority of people in the world who are totally dedicated to mining without realising that the safeguards have not been properly carried out, will not be properly carried out and that major accidents may happen around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Detailed knowledge of how the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> leakage occurred still lies hidden in the steamy, lethally radioactive chamber that houses the plant’s reactor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor is part of a sealed system, in which the core of enriched uranium is kept in a state of controlled fission whose temperature of which is governed by a closed circuit of pressurised water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But those who want to use uranium for the production of power tell us that there cannot be human errors in spite of the accidents that have happened at various <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plants around the world, and that there can be no technical failures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sir Philip  Baxter and  Sir Ernest  Titterton are the two people in this country who have spread the same story for years and years: There is no danger associated with the mining of uranium; there is no danger in constructing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors; in fact, there is no danger at all so far as uranium is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the last few days in West Germany 100,000 people in the Hanover area and along the roads to Hanover gathered to protest at the establishment of an underground dump for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste near Borleben, a small town in that locality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sir Charles  Court announced a few days ago that in a few years he hopes to have the first <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor plant in Australia operating in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party has said that there should be no further mining of uranium in this country until such time as we are convinced, totally, that there will not be the possibility of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> accident, that there will not be the possibility of uranium being used for other than so-called peaceful purposes and until such time as we can dispose of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste in a safe manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A story was floated in this country a few months ago- I think it came from Government sourcesthat a new method of disposing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste had been discovered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As recently as yesterday, in newspapers published in Australia, statements were made that as yet there is no safe way of disposing of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Two Premiers,  Mr Petersen  in Queensland and  Sir Charles  Court in Western Australia, ought to have pressure applied to them by the Federal Government to prevent the planning or establishment of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor plant in Western Australia, and the planning or establishment of a uranium enrichment plant in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the Government was also conscious in coming to its decision, of the fact that the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry has an excellent safety record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the continuing and far-reaching dilemma <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> engineers are faced with in Pennsylvania, the latest report that there is a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor in South Korea approaching a similar critical state, the fact that five <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors were closed in America because they were built in an earthquake area, the fact that a reactor is planned for an earthquake area in the Philippines, the fact that a Swedish reactor has released considerable amounts of radioactivity into the atmosphere and the fact that an Italian reactor is reported as closing because of very significant amounts of radioactivity being released into the River Po, does the Government intend to differentiate between safeguards directed towards preventing the improper use of fissionable materials and their diversion into weapons manufacture and safety as concerned with the safe operation of all elements of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will quote from  Hansard  so that there can be no mistake that in actual fact the words that I refer to were used by the Minister for Science and the Environment  (Senator Webster)  in reply to a speech by  Senator Keeffe  about the problems that were being recognised in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact not so long ago he went so far as to say that there have been no accidents in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the Minister for Science and the Environment is not terribly well informed on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> matters let me just tell him that since the USS  Thresher  incident, and up to October 1976- because that is the last date that I have- there were a total of 32 accidents involving <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> submarines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the things that I find remarkable about Harrisburg is the apparent willingness of the media to cover this story in totality when in the past they have been rather reluctant to discuss anything <span class="highlight">nuclear</span>, particularly anything antinuclear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Harrisburg has brought journals such as  Newsweek  into the general discussion of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry- and not before time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am being quite serious, and if the honourable senator looked at  Newsweek  of 15 February in which about 13 pages are devoted to the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry, he would see exactly what I mean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a study of some 35,000 workers at the Hannaford <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> facility in the United States- this was the first careful study ever carried out on workers in the industry- it was established that there is an increasing incidence of leukaemia, bone marrow cancer and lung cancer amongst the workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Should the uranium industry really get under way in this area- and it won’t stop at a research plant- there will be far more lethal problems at hand ‘, a spokesman for Goldfields Against <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Energy (GANE) said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last year and again last month I raised in Question Time the matter of inadequacies in the siting and construction of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor in the Philippines which, in terms of our contract with that nation, would be fuelled with Australian uranium and hence, in terms of our <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards agreement, is or should be a matter of direct and urgent concern to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As many people, including eminent scientists throughout the world, are very interested in SYNROC which is regarded as an extremely stable form of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste, will the Minister have discussions with Professor Ringwood to ascertain what funds are required to continue effectively this very important area of research and development? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although the Prime Minister has taken a great interest in the matter I raise, I ask the Attorney-General: Does the Government intend to introduce further legislation to extend the appointment of  Mr Justice  Fox as Ambassador-At-Large for <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Affairs, covering non-proliferation and safeguard matters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The work on which  Mr Justice  Fox has been engaged as Ambassador-at-Large for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> non-proliferation and safeguards is, in the view of the Government, work of great national importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By the mid-1950s the spread of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons had rendered this strategy no longer credible and the concept changed to a limited non-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war with China in which we would be a contributor to a predominantly United States force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>First of all it is in our interests that there should not be a global <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The likelihood of a global <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war is slight although it is significantly greater than the Department of Defence seems to think. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from what we could do to prevent the outbreak of a global <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war we should at least think about where we might stand in the aftermath of one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But so far as the composition of our Defence Force is concerned, the threat of global <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war should have no effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Besides, the manifest inability of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to defend its sea communications against <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> submarine attack makes such an attack exceptionally improbable, because it would almost inevitably escalate into a global <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia is a country with abundant reserves of coal and other fossil fuels and we are not in the position in which, unfortunately, some countries are of having a lack of reserves and resources and of having to take a decision to go to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the declining oil resources and production towards the end of the century there will need to be a tremendous effort of substitution, particularly by means of coal and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The projected increase in electricity demand cannot possibly be met without a major contribution from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power including breeder reactor application. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The share of electricity produced from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuels by the end of the century is expected to be almost 45 per cent and up to 60 per cent by the end of the period considered, 2020. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The problems of developing <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power to the extent required by the projected needs are seen to be very substantial particularly in the area of gaining public confidence and political support for such programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the absence of such a large program of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power development, some more highly developed countries which are rich in other fuel resources, may be able to maintain their economies at an acceptable level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as there will be a need for a substantial movement of energy resources, fossil fuels and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuels, from energy-rich countries to energy-poor countries, there will be a need for substantial export of capital from economically strong countries to economically weak countries, if this problem is to be solved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For the rural areas of the developing and evolving nations the cost of estabishing energy distribution systems based on electricity grids or pipelines will probably exceed available capital resources; this will reduce the possibility of use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuels by such nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After the incident at Three Mile Island in the United States, where it was substantiated that it was not purely human error but also the unexpected functioning of the equipment in the reactor that caused the problem, one wonders how on earth a country could go ahead and build a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor in an area which can be affected by earthquakes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been very difficult to find customers in the world because of the cost of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and because of community disquiet about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors and the disposal of the wastes that result from those reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even where the anti-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> marchers do not turn up, as they have so conspicuously at the Seabrook plant in New Hampshire, utilities have soured on the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> option for other reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rocketing cost of building <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plants alone has discouraged many utilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main reason for those rising costs is the continuing imposition of stricter safety standards by the regulators … the reevaluation of the nation’s seventy-two <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plants after the accident seems bound to lead to costly new safety requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The New York State Power Authority last month decided to cut its losses after the price tag on a proposed 1,200 megawatt <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plant on the Hudson River below Albany, scheduled for completion in the late I980’s, climbed from $1.8 billion to $3. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A cost that is not always taken into account when one talks about the cost of producing electricity from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors-  mainly because the nation has no experience yet in dismantling a big one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power provides only one-eighth of all electricity, it represents a mere sixty-fourth of all energy at the point of use- not a great deal more than firewood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Critics have long complained that the federal government subsidizes <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power in several ways: by undercharging for uranium enrichment, by proposing too low a fee for radioactive-waste disposal, and through the Price-Anderson Act, which sets a $S60-million limit on utilities’ insurance liability for each reactor accident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And the cost of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power has been questioned because it does not cover the entire anticipated cost of dismantling reactors when their useful life is over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been some talk this afternoon about the desirability of somehow or other pretending that the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry does not exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> power stations do exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact 199 <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations operate today around the world, 209 are being built and another 106 are on order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Countries are not building <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations to annoy the environmentalists or the people who get frightened by radiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are building the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations because they need them to maintain the welfare of their people and their industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the United States of America generates 13 per cent of all its power from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no way that the United States can suddenly overnight withdraw 13 per cent of its power segment which comes from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These countries need <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy in the short term to provide them with a source of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Melzer quoted  Mr Schlesinger  of the United States Administration as saying that the great <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> boom will never come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe we will have a great <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> boom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am saying is that we do need <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations because they are established and they cannot be substituted overnight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the implied arguments against the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation is that other forms are utterly safe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In contrast, there is a case for the comparative ecological cleanliness of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> production of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We of the Australian Democrats have the gravest doubts about the viability of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, our policy is to oppose the mining and export of Australian uranium because we believe, after considering as many aspects of it as we can find, that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power, as an industry, is pollutant, dangerous and uneconomic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the foreseeable future, the Australian Democrats see few glimmerings of improvement on the horizon; rather, with incidents such as occurred at Harrisburg, we see more problems ahead for the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is also unfair that the Commission should appear to be so much a propagandist for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is wrong, in a country which is so divided and in a world which is so divided on the subject of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power, that the Commission and its staff, to which every taxpayer contributes, should be called on to carry out a partisan role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To meet the continuing demand for factual information on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> subjects, Commission staff again responded to some 200 requests for talks to groups and organisations during the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object is to achieve a better use of resources in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> and non-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On 10 May 1979  (Hansard,  page 1794)  Senator Mcintosh  asked me, as Minister representing the Prime Minister, a question without notice concerning <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-65-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decisions on future electricity generating capacity and the technologies employed are essentially for individual States to make, but Australia has many international obligations in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> area and it is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government to ensure that these are met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-65-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>International obligations arise, for example, from our adherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Weapons (NPT), from bilateral <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> cooperation and safeguards agreements to which Australia is a Party and from Australia ‘s acceptance of international guidelines, circulated as IAEA Information Circular No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-65-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>254, for the export of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material, equipment or technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-65-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, these matters will be of importance in any move to generate electricity in Australia by <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-65-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Does the Government intend to continue to differentiate between (a) safeguards directed towards preventing the improper use of fissionable materials and their diversion into weapon manufacture and (b) safety as it relates to the safe operation of all elements of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry, in view of: (i) the continuing and far-reaching dilemma <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> engineers are faced with in Pennsylvania; (ii) the latest report that there is a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor in South Korea which is approaching a similar critical state; (iii) the fact that five <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors were closed in South America because they were built in an earthquake area; (iv) the fact that a reactor is planned for an earthquake area in the Philippines; (v) the fact that a Swedish reactor has released considerable amounts of radioactivity into the atmosphere; and (vi) the possibility that an Italian reactor may be closing because of various significant amounts of radioactivity which are being released into the River Po. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-86-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the Government is concerned that strict and effective safety standards apply in all activities in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel cycle, and looks to individual countries to take appropriate measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-86-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government endorses the importance of those <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safety standards which have been and may be agreed upon in international discussions in forums such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Energy Agency (NEA) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-86-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America concerning peaceful uses of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy, together with an agreed minute; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> transfers between Australia and the United Kingdom, together with an agreed minute and an exchange of letters; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate take note of the statements of agreement concerning <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, that is the raw material of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power and of the atomic bomb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress the atomic bomb aspect particularly because I feel that a distinction should be drawn between more sophisticated <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons such as the hydrogen bomb, which holds the so-called balance of terror, and the atomic bomb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The world has gone through what could be called a very bad scene over dirty <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons of a small size, which were in effect the type of atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise this point now especially since it has been proven that the technology available to many smaller powers involves the use of so-called peaceful electricity power reactors which can be adapted to the making of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also some evidence- I believe that it is well enough authenticated- that it was there made into <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> devices, in secret. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure honourable senators would be aware that it has been highly publicised that a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon is being constructed in Pakistan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt but that we are on the road to proliferation and manufacture not of weapons which are the so-called balance of terror- the hydrogen bomb which I hope will never be used because of its dreadful impact- but of small, nasty, dirty A-bombs which, if they are used in any quantity even in a limited local war, will contaminate this planet with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fall-out to an extent to which it has never been contaminated before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people want <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons; they have said that they want <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people say that we have no responsibility, others say that perhaps it is a responsibility or that we should try to exercise responsibility so that these countries cannot divert our uranium to make <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have also seen a great change in the demand for energy in the area of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever some people may say, we have to accept that the world today has decided that it must go <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> to fill this energy gap. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can look at the statistics and find outlined very clearly what is happening with regard to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>From the figures of 27 March 1979, which are very recent figures, we find that some 53 countries throughout the world are committed to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I went to see a great <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power station which was very near an important river. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have seen more <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations than the honourable senator has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At least 3,000 metric tonnes of spent <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel are now being stored at commercial reactor sites and with an additional 17,000 metric tonnes expected to accumulate in the next decade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon proliferation problem relates to the security of every nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assurances of supply of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> materials, services, equipment, and technology for civil <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> purposes are dependent on the establishment of non-proliferation measures which are recognised as adequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of nations do not regard existing treaties and international arrangements, embodied in the IAEA/NPT system and certain regional arrangements, as adequate to deal with the proliferation risks arising from the widespread use of civil <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The absence of uniformity not only tends to distort international trade patterns in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> materials, services and equipment, but also may subject <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> enterprises in recipient countries to conflicting conditions . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am appalled to find that whenever the question of uranium mining and development in Australia is raised members of the Labor Party throw up their hands in horror and start screaming about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know very well that the United Kingdom, for example, is accepting <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste from countries such as Japan well knowing that in the future it will have a resource of energy which will be quite valuable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite crazy for honourable senators opposite to suggest that action we take here will prevent 53 countries from proceeding with programs to expand <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy in order to provide their populations with the energy required to increase their quality of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Hardly a ripple of concern was expressed in the papers of Australia about that accident yet if a uranium industry worker tripped and broke his neck in Harrisburg or at another <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plant there would be hell to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United States interests stem from the giant parent company of Wyoming and Delhi- the Westinghouse Corporation- which builds and maintains <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> armaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not so very long ago the Minister for Science and the Environment said, as did  Senator Collard  a little while ago, that there had not been a death in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he is still not satisfied I ask him to come back to me and I will then talk to him about the Nugget file, which contains excerpts from the United States Government’s special internal file on <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plant accidents and safety defects, as obtained in January 1979 by the Union of Concerned Scientists under the Freedom of Information Act of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us hear what these people have to say about <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It had to be uncovered because this fellow in charge of the <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Regulatory Commission was hiding facts, not only from the people in the United States but also from the world, as to what really was happening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Nugget File is a collection of short reports, averaging perhaps 2-3 pages in length, about a wide variety of astonishing safety deficiencies at U.S. <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It casts light on both the technical and institutional aspects of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power reactor safety and shows how seriously the image of safety in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> program is blemished by simple and widespread carelessness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are not opposed to the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy if we can be satisfied that the working conditions of the people who are going to mine the product are safeguarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I point out to  Senator Collard  that that is something that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> scientists are still arguing about throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no known way at the moment that we can say that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy is safe and that the mining of uranium is safe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Hansard relates to the world <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It indicates that the world <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power reactors are not just in the developed countries, but that very many are now being constructed or planned in the undeveloped countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have a table which indicates that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power reactors exist in Iron Curtain countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I make is that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power reactors are a part of life in the world today; they are required for the good living and welfare of the very many nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They claimed that the mere possession of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> material, coupled with the threat or presence of bomb construction, could suffice to produce the effect desired by terrorists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not too long ago he said that there is only a 50 per cent chance of mankind reaching the end of this century because of the risk of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> holocaust occurring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He pointed out the grave risks of using radioactive substances for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy and advocated the use of alternative safer resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet the first or second <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> agreement we signed for the sale of our uranium was with Finland, which is openly sending its material, our uranium, to the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe, the Democrats believe, that going to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power and exporting our uranium is the ultimate insanity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister representing the Prime Minister aware that in the final document adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on disarmament held in New York in 1978, many countries expressed their concern about the continuing threat to mankind of the proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons and the spiralling costs of the arms race and the effect of the latter on the economic and social development of the peoples of the world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should make it clear that the present issue is not the building of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our cheap coal resources make it most unlikely that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power will be economically competitive here within the foreseeable future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Coal, like all fossil fuel but unlike <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power, gives off carbon dioxide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> power stations have been in use in Britain for a quarter of a century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently an intensive study was made of the health of long term <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plant workers who receive radiation doses comparable to open cut miners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The health of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plant workers in every respect, including incidence of all types of cancer, was found to be marginally better than that of their peer group in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here they raise three issues: The risk of nulcear weapon proliferation, the dangers of nu.cear power generation, and the possibility of terrorists obtaining <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say at the outset that, if I thought that Australia, by refusing to mine uranium, could in the slightest degree reduce the risk of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war or the spread of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons, I should be the most ardent advocate of leaving uranium in the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an exporter we would have some chance of influencing the improvement of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trouble is that the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> nonproliferation treaty is seriously defective, particularly because three <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> powers- France, China and India- are not members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the treaty has been in existence <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons have proliferated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>India has exploded a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> device using indigenous uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no future in attempting to control the spread of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons by controlling the supply of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For use in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors, the proportion of U235 has to be increased through the enrichment process so that the percentage of U235 is 3 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must admit, there is one other possible source of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons grade material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the plutonium and unburned uranium are removed from the spent fuel, recycled as it is called, there is a potentially dangerous situation because the plutonium could be used by national governments for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons or perhaps could be hijacked by terrorist groups for the same purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that senators can see that if we want to stop the spread of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons, as I am sure we all do, the sensible approach is not to try to control the supply of uranium- that is a hopeless prospect- but to control the key points, the uranium enrichment and the recycling process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, as a result of inadequate controls, a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war breaks out, to all intents and purposes it would mean the end of our civilisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main aim of our policy must be to achieve control of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are surprising to the statistically ignorant who have been listening to the strident anti-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A few weeks ago,  Senator Coleman  tabled a list of incidents in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plants of varying authenticity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, accidents do occur in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plants, but even in the celebrated Three Mile Island incident, the maximum dose of radiation received by any one of the two million people living in the area was 80 millirem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Imagine the outcry there would have been if casualties such as those had been caused by a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think it is clear that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation is probably the safest method of power generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> power stations do not emit carbon dioxide, but do they emit radiation which would affect other countries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is possible that a geiger counter could prove that the level of radioactivity in the Grand Central Railway Station is higher than that emitted from a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average person receives in radiation in the course of a year 100 millirem from background radiation, 70 to 80 millirem from medical and dental X-rays, four millirem from all past <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions and 0.2 of a millirem from all the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is worth noting that one receives more additional radiation in a single one-hour flight and nine times more radiation by living in Canberra rather than Melbourne or Sydney than one receives from all the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations in the world in a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To suggest that we should attempt to stop <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation in other countries because of possible damage to the world environment is farcically absurd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can do nothing with yellowcake or with the fuel rods for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plants, and the plutonium in the reactor waste is in a highly radioactive environment and is not accessible without enormous technological effort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the belief that the world had very little recoverable uranium, it was felt that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power would not be available on any large scale unless the plutonium were recovered from the spent fuel and reused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the United States, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors produce about 15 per cent of all electricity generated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>France is aiming to produce half of its electricity by <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power by 1985. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let there be no mistake: If there are doubts about the supply of uranium, countries will not give up <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think I should say something about the disposal of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> wastes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A recent poll in America revealed that twothirds of Americans thought that under certain circumstances <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power stations could explode like atom bombs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it will be with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The non-communist world is heavily hooked on Middle East oil and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power is the only feasible relief in sight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the Russian point of view, if the non-communist world can be kept hooked on Middle East oil by denying or delaying its use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power, then the non-communist world is weakened both economically and militarily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But, dangerous or not, it is their policy, and left wing groups in the Western countries, including Australia, are obediently leading the fight against <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first question we must ask is: Have we the right to decide for other countries whether they should use <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation, or is that a decision for the governments of the countries concerned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second question is: Have we the right to neglect to use our power to improve <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards and to prevent the world from moving into the plutonium age, with all its attendant dangers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Efforts were made in this chamber last night by the blatant uranium lobbyist,  Senator Hamer,  to assure the Senate that practically all fields in the uranium and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry are safe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw the Minister’s attention to this morning’s Press report concerning the United States <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Regulatory Commission’s ordering the immediate closure of an atomic fuel fabrication plant in Tennessee, which reported the loss of uranium suitable for making <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to your question without notice, on Wednesday, 29 August, 1979, regarding reports of accidents at the French <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test site on Mururoa Atoll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There were a number of press reports during August about accidents at the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test site on Mururoa Atoll in French Polynesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The French authorities assert that the type of large wave which swept Mururoa Atoll road on 26 July cannot be created by shock waves generated by <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosions and that the timing of the wave did not coincide with the timing of any <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the light of this and other questions which have been raised since the Government produced its <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards proposal, will there now be a reexamination to ensure that those safeguards are adequate for the health and welfare of people involved in the mining, processing and transportation of uranium or yellowcake and particularly the health and welfare of those people who are presently living in the vicinity of the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> installation at Lucas Heights? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Yesterday Senator Georges asked me what attitude the Government had adopted towards the United States consideration of the possibility of establishing facilities for the storage of spent <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel on a number of islands in the South Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The facility would handle spent fuel from commercial <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power reactors located not  in the  United States but in other countries of the Pacific area which have <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Special Session, however, marked a turning point because it was there that Governments demonstrated a willingness to confront directly problems of conventional and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> arms build-up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the early sixties, the United States and Soviet Union had some hundreds of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> warheads each. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Seventeen items relating to questions of disarmament and international security are listed on the agenda and they include major issues such as the implementation of the recommendations of the special session, a strengthening of security of non-<span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon states, the implementation of the declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace, the prohibition of the development and manufacture of new weapons of mass destruction and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The deployment of these missiles by NATO is based on distrust of the Soviet Union and a growing realisation that the United States would not necessarily risk a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war in the event of Western Europe being attacked by Warsaw Pact forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the major problems in the progress of the Indian Ocean zone of peace discussions is the possibility of Pakistan and India acquiring <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recent pressures to build up forces in the United States of America and in Europe have arisen because of the decrying by senior defence planners of the credibility of the United States <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> umbrella. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nightmare threat of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war still haunts mankind and the world’s arsenals grow in size and sophistication, fuelling tensions and engendering a mindless waste of resources which could help to alleviate the plight of millions whose basic needs are not met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the United States Senate,  Senator Mark  Hatfield said that SALT was another one of those escalating steps in the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> arms race which would stimulate production of new weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States and the Soviet Union would race to reach the maximum levels of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons allowed under the Treaty, including missiles suitable for destroying the other nation’s offence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the proposed treaty was further flawed because it did not outlaw guidance improvements that would give <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> warheads absolute accuracy, and that this was needed only for a first-strike capability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> arsenals of the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics will be growing, not shrinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major powers practise secrecy about their <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> arsenals and particularly about the number of tactical <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could talk at length of the fact that a first strike would probably destroy 140 million people in the Soviet Union in a major <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war and that, similarly, something like 105 million to 1 30 million would be destroyed in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet its total cost over the years is only half of what is spent every day for military purposes, and only a third of what will be spent, strictly for procurement, for each of the new ‘Trident’ <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> missile submarines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most dangerous area for the world involves <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons, both the possession of these weapons by the super-powers and the possibility of widespread proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is probably proper for the United States to ratify them but I cannot think of any marked effect they will have on the likelihood of a global <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both the United States and Russia, for the foreseeable future, will maintain enormous arsenals of immensely destructive <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their very existence is the strongest deterrent there can be to the outbreak of a global <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second area of great concern must be the possibility of the proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trouble is that the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Weapons is seriously defective, particularly because three <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> powers- France, China and India- are not signatories to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Treaty has been in existence <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons have proliferated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>India has exploded a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapon, using indigenous uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no future in attempting to control the spread of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons by controlling the supply of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are trying to stop <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> proliferation, which I am sure is the aim of all of us, what we should be doing is not to waste time on the hopeless task of trying to control the availability of uranium but to concentrate on what can be done, that is, to control the process of enriching it into weapons grade material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other thing we must do if we wish to stop the spread of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons is to see that plutonium is not extracted from the wastes of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors and that countries do not go in for fast breeder plutonium reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we try to restrict the supplies of uranium and artificially create a shortage, we will not stop countries from using <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power but we will force them into recycling their <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plant wastes and extracting plutonium- a great danger to the spread of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons- and going into fast breeder plutonium reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we ensure- as we can- that there is a ready supply of uranium at reasonable prices we will be making a major contribution to the prevention of the proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should also continuously monitor spent fuel, the wastes of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactors, to ensure that plutonium is not being extracted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is not only <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons that are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, in two key areas of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons proliferation we have a chance to play a significant role, if we use our power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I return to my point that we can play a significant part in the prevention of the outbreak of a global <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> war and the proliferation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We bring up this topic because, among other things, in the world we have a balance of terror which is sustained by <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons on the part of both major super-powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The program to eradicate malaria, estimated at a cost of some $450m, is dragging on owing to a lack of funds, yet that total cost over the years is only half of what is spent every day for military purposes and only a third of what will be spent strictly for procurement to set up a Trident <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> submarine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As exposure to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> radiation toxic chemicals and biological agents requires fast action and as this unit provides this essential treatment, will the Minister’s Department, if it has not already done so, investigate and evaluate this potential life-saving unit? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister for Science and the Environment and ask whether the Minister has read an article in the Press of 5 November reporting a claim by an eminent United States scientist  Dr Roy  that he has discovered a process to reverse phenomena that occur during <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fission chain reaction thus making radioactive waste harmless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not approve of the extremist view which is so often put in the Senate and elsewhere that there is no problem at all with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paragraph 8 of the Minister’s statement also confirms that when it says:   the Government recognises that validation of some of the technical principles involved in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste disposal in geological repositories will have to await construction and operation of such facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once one has committed oneself anywhere in the world to having <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste in storage one also has a security problem because of the risk of criticality and subsequent atomic explosion of plutonium stored as waste or as a result of deliberate action by states or criminal individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether it is short term or long term storage there is the problem of disposing of plutonium and other transuranic residues of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> fuel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is clearly the case that if one generation can bury <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste, another generation can knowingly or unknowingly disturb the same waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is also the case that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> programs are in progress and that these entail large amounts of deadly waste being in circulation, requiring a high degree of surveillance to guard against human fallibility and mal-intent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the lack of such information which renders the public or some members of it suspicious of those who operate the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> industry and exposes them to anxieties which are needless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is equally clear, however, that many of the anxieties which are felt are without foundation and spring from a fear of anything <span class="highlight">nuclear</span>, no doubt partly due to the fact that the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs, with their devastating effects were the opening events of the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was definitely reported to the United States  President,  after very exhaustive surveys of the incident at Three-Mile Island, that there had been severe failures in construction methods and in management techniques in relation to the operation of that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> facility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I realise I am straying by debating this matter with  Senator Young,  but he has raised and presented to the Australian public on the radio broadcasting night a report which is gravely deficient in that the most exhaustive examination of a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> accident to have taken place since electricity generation by <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> means was invented contradicts much of the easy nonchalance which he displayed in his few remarks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The bodies of the three men in charge of the reactor were found stuck to the ceiling, having been penetrated by the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> rods that blew out of the reactor when the accident occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very interesting to note that one of the most reactionary governments in the world today, the Philippines, has declined to go ahead with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> development in Bataan province. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>President  Marcos has refused or declined to go ahead with that development because he fears that Westinghouse has not built a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor capable of withstanding all the various pressures that may be applied to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also say to  Senator Young,  and to anybody who seems to want to go ahead with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> development in this country today, that we in the Australian Labor Party have only one objection to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> development, and that is the problem of waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as we are concerned, when science can- I am convinced that it will- overcome that problem of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste and no problems remain for future generations, the Labor Party will change its policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to  Senator Rae  that it is very interesting to note that a few years ago, when I was a member of a committee relating to the Australian Capital Territory, that Committee was told that the Canberra Hospital was pouring <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste down the sink. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the way <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste is being handled at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scientists, technicians and other people who work in areas where <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power is used do not know what to do with the waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Right throughout society today I suggest that because this problem has not been solved hospitals and other people who want to get rid of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste just pour it down the sink and let future generations, the fish and God knows who cop the effects from that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The international scientific community is working towards the future development of industrial facilities for waste disposal, and the Government recognises that validation of some of the technical principles involved in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste disposal in geological repositories will have to await construction and operation of such facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By what yardstick can anyone suggest that we have a solution to this key question of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste disposal which would warrant this country- or for that matter any other country at its risk if it wants to- producing this <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste for which there is obviously no proven means of disposing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power can be found to be a safe means of generating power for the use of mankind then certainly let us use it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With respect to  Senator Young,  he has stated here tonight that virtually false arguments have been used by members of the Opposition in presenting the Opposition’s case against the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government was asked then to give an assurance that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste would not be imported for depositing in Australia back from countries which were using Australian uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that if this Government is so concerned about its responsibility for the exporting of uranium that we can assume that it has the same measure of responsibility if Central Australia proves to be the only place where <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste can be satisfactorily stored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us hope that the Government will be quite emphatic and that it will tell any user or potential users of Australian uranium that Australia will not become a dumping ground for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may have been some slightly bad engineering, but the point one has to realise is that <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> engineering has some of the highest forms of technology that the human race has yet attained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have not had one death in <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation we would not have that rate of failure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That problem is avoided with <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this humbug is spoken about getting rid of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power but, as  Senator Young  said, we are in a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Japan gets about 20 per cent of its power from <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> sources; Belgium gets about 18 per cent; Britain about 13 per cent; and the United States of America about 13 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this business of the old socialist dogma of the research, the entrepreneurial production business, and safeguards is really a veiled attack, a Trojan horse to destroy our capacity to understand and use <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that the issue that we see here is a matter of blatant lobbying which is being carried out by honourable senators on the Government side for the uranium interests, these people who stand to make millions or billions of dollars out of this industry without the necessary basic preparation for the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> era and the accidents that are happening all over the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement by  Senator Coleman  at page 363 of  Hansard  on 29 August indicates that right throughout the whole area of development of the uranium industry and of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation these accidents are happening, and there is a tremendous amount of basic work still to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should also like to draw attention to the fact that because we are opposed to the immediate mining and processing of Australia’s vast uranium deposits does not mean that we will always oppose the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise these matters because of the attitude that has been taken by  Senator Young  and  Senator MacGibbon-  that this industry will go ahead regardless of the consequences to the human element associated with the production of uranium and the development of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The history of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power so far is a reflection on the fact that the scientists are prepared to subvert the great ideals that they have held in the past for the sake of a fast buck. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As long as I am able to stand in my place and warn people against the hazards and dangers of uranium and <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power generation, I intend to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Young  said in his opening remarks that  Senator Coleman  had incorporated in the Senate  Hansard of 29  August 1979 false and misleading statements in reference to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power industry accidents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I went quickly through those 1 78 references which  Senator Coleman  incorporated in  Hansard  and I found that in 1 96 1 at Idaho Falls in the United States of America three men were killed instantly in a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> reactor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not know what happened, but it was a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> submarine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 26 August 1978 at the Titan <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> base in Kansas one man was killed and six injured when deadly fumes leaked from an intercontinental ballistic missile which was being filled with propellant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The accident would have resulted in a <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> explosion of the missile had it been carrying its <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> warhead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is this not potentially as disastrous as <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> warfare? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Has the Leader of the Government in the Senate heard of an association of doctors known as Doctors for <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Awareness which was set up recently in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister agree with the goals of this association and, indeed, of many other Australians that there should be a moratorium on building <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power plants and a phasing out of existing ones, a cessation of the export of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology, extensive studies of populations exposed to <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> radiation, <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons disarmament, and the development of conservation policies and renewable energy resources? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I have not had the advantage of learning of an organisation such as Doctors for <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Awareness and, therefore, I have not seen any manifesto setting out its goals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the dissemination of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> technology for peaceful purposes is an authentic role for the community as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, we are implacably committed to all the safeguards associated with the use of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy for electric power purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Also,  Senator Young  raised the matter of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> development and quite a lengthy debate ensued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe  Senator Missen  was the only member of this Parliament to raise the possibility that some sections of that Act as used to regulate the exploitation of the Ranger uranium deposit were in contradiction to the sons of principles which should govern the peaceful exploitation of those resources for the development of energy concerns rather than, as at the time when the legislation was originally framed, for the provision of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons materials for our allies, such as when Rum Jungle was the deposit being exploited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-94">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In his Ministerial Statement on Government Policy on <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Safeguards of 24 May 1977, the Prime Minister stated that ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>‘Australia and the Republic of Korea signed a bilateral Agreement concerning Cooperation in Peaceful Uses of <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Energy and the Transfer of <span class="highlight">Nuclear</span> Material on 2 May 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Agreement incorporates all the Government’s <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> safeguards requirements for uranium exports and its provisions include proscription of military and explosive use; strict safeguards requirements including access by Australia to the conclusions of IAEA inspections in the Republic of Korea and sanctions in the event of a breach by the Republic of Korea of these safeguards or of NPT obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Republic of Korea has also entered into <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> cooperation agreements with the United States and Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are significant practical, economic and political deterrents against the Republic of Korea building <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A decision by the Republic of Korea to develop <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> weapons would be contrary to its multilateral and bilateral undertakings, and would seriously disrupt outside supplies for its planned large-scale peaceful <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> energy program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that steaming coal is about to become the most highly prized energy source now that the generation of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> power has proved to be too dangerous and too costly? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in this context, rather than in relation to the <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> debate, that the value of steaming coal is most relevant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the government will take all steps to acquaint the people with the dangers of <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> warfare and to work internationally for <span class="highlight">nuclear</span> disarmament and that it will refuse to diminish Australia’s independence and standing through the construction of an Omega station in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></li>
