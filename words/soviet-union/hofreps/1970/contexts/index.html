    <p>I can inform the House that it is the normal policy of the USSR to try to ensure that countries in its immediate vicinity or close to the Russian borders give the kind of help, and according to the conditions, that might be imposed by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700605_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is understood to have interpreted ‘Kurile Islands’ as including Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomais, the last being the most southerly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-34-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs: Has Australia expressed a view to Indonesia and Malaysia on the regime in the Strait of Malacca, as the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and Japan are reported to have done? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister for Foreign Affairs seen reports that Jews wishing to leave the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> are being forced to pay for their freedom by being charged, on a sliding scale commensurate with their education, for their visas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However on several occasions in the United Nations, the last occasion being at the meeting of the General Assembly last year, we have raised our voice and spoken in favour of the free movement of Jews from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot mention precisely at this time or in this place the countries that I shall be visiting but among them clearly will be the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> which for some time has been pressing for a visit, particularly since I have already visited the United States of America, Japan, China and Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has encouraged a situation which would have helped to persuade the United States not to be involved, not to reinforce its capacities at Diego Garcia, and therefore it has encouraged a situation which would have left the Indian Ocean to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today, honourable members received parcels of unleavened bread or matzah, as it is known, for forwarding to Jews in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> who are unable to get the proper bread for their celebration of the Passover this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the ways in which the atheistic Soviet Government persecutes all religions and I have here an account of the mean and horrible way in which it has endeavoured to deprive the Jews in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> of the ceremonial bread which they need for their celebration of the Passover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reasonable people can however reasonably conclude that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> still seeks to expand its influence throughout the world in order to achieve Soviet primacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would seem that there is an impression that the present activities of the United States are a reaction to the growing strength of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would also seem to be the impression in some places that the Government is not aware of the concerns that are aroused as a result of the growing strength of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>’s offensive forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is perhaps not surprising that the  Sydney Morning Herald,  in its brief and inadequate report of my criticisms, published the inaccurate smear of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro  (Mr Sainsbury)  that I have not opposed nuclear power in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That in the opinion of this House the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has by its continuing violations of basic human rights revealed itself to be unfit to be the host nation of the 1980 Olympic Games. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, has the Government made the strongest possible protest to the Government of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> over this deplorable incident? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He also said that Vietnam went hand in hand with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> for the military and otherwise subversive destruction of Asia and all that that threat implies to Australia Where do members of the Labor Party stand? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not exchanging the model safeguards agreement with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, as the honourable member knows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He also knows that the review of relations with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> was brought about by discovery of the devices to which I referred and nothing more than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The record was evident even theft, and the rape of Hungary stands as a monument to the fulfilment of that threat by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> in the fifties- a monumental example of interference, invasion and the rape of another nation’s independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the House notes the 40th Anniversary of the signing of the infamous Ribbentrop-Molotov Treaty in Moscow on the night of 23-24 August 1939 as a vital prelude to the commencement of World War II, and recalls with regret that notwithstanding the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> continues to enjoy the rights guaranteed to it by the said Treaty, involving the enslavement of many independent nations and over 250 million citizens of Central and Eastern Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example, sales of beef and mutton totalling 30.000 tons have been made to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and there is a possibility of further sales being made to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The person concerned is Alexander Nikolaevich Shelepin, who for  2  years from December  1958  was chief of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> secret police and who retired from the position to one of less obvious connection but no less influence with that infamous organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We could never enjoy any real security or even a sense of security if we turned  a  blind eye to the problems of South East Asia, to the aggressive and subversive policies of the Communist planners and nations, and especially to the recent activities of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> in the Indian Ocean and South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> can get rid of the Chinese distraction on its eastern border its possibilities of surveillance over Albania, Yugoslavia and Rumania may begin to operate, and then from the forcible consolidation of the Communist bloc the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> may be well placed to dominate western Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The embarrassments of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> in relation to China exist because China has the intelligence to raise ideological issues about her borders and about Soviet domination of subject nationalities which have put the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> on the ideological defensive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Marked reductions in imports into India  and  Pakistan and also in those by Mainland China  and  the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> were the main cause of the decline in world trade in 1963-69. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is due to several factors, the first being that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> was a big importer in the mid 1960s but today is an exporter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is not always the case with some other Western donors,It is certainly not the case with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and the other Communist countries, whose aid announcements are ludicrously short of the actual transfer of resources, short by more than 50 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, in the misguided belief that Australia’s defences were best guarded by having American troops held down indefinitely on the Asian mainland, the Australian government has helped to distort America’s own foreign policy, particularly her efforts to achieve a detente with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Government of West Germany under Herr Brandt has greatly influenced relations between the two Germanies, between West Germany and Eastern Europe and between West Germany and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me mention the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> that has penetrated into the Middle East with policies that have been highly successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> that, the United States charged, had assisted Egypt in breaking the ceasefire in the early days of the ceasefire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a clear, implicit Soviet objective of a canal reopened, but perhaps reopened for the ships of one navy - the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>’s navy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would clearly make it much easier for the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> to maintain and strengthen her naval presence in the Indian Ocean, a presence which must first be established before she can use that presence for political or strategic purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be in 1 year, it may be in 5 or 10 years, but there will be increased tension as a result of Soviet activities in this part of the world, and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> will use that tension and its presence to advance its political and strategic purposes, and the shorter time scale may be more relevant than the later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clearly China in history has no cause to love any of the great powers, least of all the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> which still occupies territories that China regards as her own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Congress, which is the supreme body of the Communist Party of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, saw the return of  Mr Breznhev  as Party Secretary and  Mr Breznhev  is a resolute opponent of any concessions on the border dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the very great differences between the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and China, it would be unwise to hope for any real rapprochement between China and America against Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Chinese terms the United States is an Imperialist country; the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is Social Imperialist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The institutional framework for relations between this country and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is remarkably primitive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> does not lack interest in Australia but quite clearly it regards it as an anomaly - a country which cannot be accommodated in its geographical region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This puts Australia in a very difficult position to assert its foreign policy to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> in a regional context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The aid given by India and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> involves, in both cases, the provision of military personnel from those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>thrusting south the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> would be supporting her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>’s objection to China was that China was raising the question of the 600,000 square miles of Chinese territory annexed by the czars after 1858 and was raising the kind of ideological issues which are a potential dissolvent of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, whether Georgians, Ukranians or others would continue or wish to continue to be subordinate to the White Russians in what is a vast colonial empire of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The revolutionary anti-colonialist principles of China are a potential dissolvent of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has 3 million troops along the borders of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>De Gaulle realised that if the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> could get rid of this Chinese distraction nothing would stop her from occupying with the greatest of ease Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Romania - all Communist countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether we like Mao Tse-tung or not, a lot of people who have not the slightest sympathy with his regime would prefer Mao if he is not subordinate to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> than Liu Shao-chi if he was prepared to go into unity with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But there is no doubt in anybody’s mind that we Australians and the Australian Government are opposed to the sort of government which is in existence in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The question at large of social attitudes and social influences in this area can, of course, open up a whole gamut of possibilities between the wholesale creches of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and our hitherto held concept of a young child’s place being in the home with the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that Japan in its weapons development could outpace such countries as the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our exports to Japan, the United Kingdom and particularly the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> are up on the previous year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I notice, in the ‘Encyclopaedia Britannica’, that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, Yugoslavia, the Argentine, Brazil and Mexico already have compensation payable on the basis of 100 per cent rate benefit in their normal wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us consider other countries such as; to mention the ones I have already spoken of, Mexico, Argentina, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and Bulgaria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us seize the opportunity now to get rational, peaceful and fruitful relations between all the great powers in the Pacific - China and the United States, Japan and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not only a humanitarian question, but it is a provocation towards a war - a provocation towards a war in which both the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and Communist China might intervene if it is launched. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will be aware that India has signed a treaty of peace, friendship and co-operation with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> on 9th August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally we are studying this treaty closely to assess its possible implications for the presence of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> on the Indian sub-con tinent and in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it is any use at this stage the American Government wringing its hands about the friendship treaty between the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that honourable members who were here at the time when troops from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and other Warsaw Pact countries invaded Czechoslovakia will recall that on both sides of the House honourable members united to express the concern through this Parliament of all the people of Australia at what was happening in that part of the world at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 would not be so bold as to say that we were so well situated to improve relations with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> but I did notice - as a matter of fact when I arrived in Tokyo and was met by my old opponent but good friend,  Mr Gordon  Freeth - as a crowning irony that the Prime Minister had just said this about the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and me: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation technically is that not only is Japan still in a state of war with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> but she is still also in a state of war with China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps I should speak briefly on the difficulty between China and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She realises that she could not defeat the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She is willing to hold o.ut for 20 or 30 years until she is in a position of equality with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> before she enters into an equal treaty to ratify those borders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, when  Mr Chou  denounced *he <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> for terminating the Sino-Soviet friendship treaty, the Leader of the Opposition said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Japan may either go in with China in an economic entente, despite words, or she may go in with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must re-assess our position with regard to Great Britain, the United States, China, Japan and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had to take those steps because the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> could not, because of differences that they have that at the present time seem to be irreconcilable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at least the doors must be opened and the goal of US policy must be in the long term, ending the isolation of Mainland China, and a normalisation of our relations with Mainland China because, looking down the road, and let’s just look ahead IS to 20 years, the United States could have a perfectly effective agreement with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> for limitation of arms - the danger of any confrontation there - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is referring to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> - might have been almost totally removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member further forgets that the one significant strategic difference between the situation that then prevailed and that which is now beginning to emerge is China’s growing fear of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> which makes China look outward to see what other relationships she might form and what changes she might be able to make in her connections with other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At this time Australia is seeking to broaden its relations with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and to normalise its relations wilh the People’s Republic of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In submitting proposals to the Secretary-General regarding the review of the United Nations’ Charter, which are required before 1st July 1972, will the Government give consideration to the need to move for (a) negotiating an international exchange of press space and broadcasting time, (b) representation for China and Tibet separately (as for the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, the Ukraine and Byelorussia) to encourage China to accept de facto representation for Taiwan, and separate representation for contending regimes in other divided countries, (c) universal suffrage in developing nations as a step towards democratic representation at the General Assembly or an associated House of Deputies and (d) growing legislative, judicial and executive powers for the United Nations as a pre-requisite for total disarmament, co-ordinated world development and control of the environment, subject to safeguards for national sovereignty in purely national matters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-37-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was talking about the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  - he gave away in advance every bargaining counter that Australia has in future negotiations with China and in the process gratuitously insulted not only the United States, Japan, Thailand, the Philippines and Cambodia but even the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the former Minister for External Affairs and former honourable member for Forrest,  Mr Gordon  Freeth - the present Ambassador to Japan - introduced his infamous new Government line on the proposed Soviet security treaty in the Indian Ocean, etc., in 1969, I was the first in this Parliament to place on record strong criticism of our linking ourselves in any way in  a  security treaty with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, just as I criticised our involvement with the United States of America in Vietnam and our involvement with the United Kingdom in the Malaysian-Indonesian crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not consider that I said at any time that the honourable member for Reid supported the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did say that if the honourable member was prepared to obtain from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and the People’s Republic of China details of their instruments and weapons installations he would be more impressive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Klass has said that the Pine Gap base is used to get information about a possible sneak attack by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> upon the United States of America, or indeed, upon us - a sneak attack from anywhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is one thing more than another which is likely to lead to war it is the belief by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> that it could launch a sneak attack and get away with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The one purpose of this base, if one accepts what  Mr Klass  has sard, is to prevent a sneak attack by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> on one of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the only information that honourable members of the Opposition had was what  Mr Klass  had said, they are coming out openly in favour of aggression by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They want to help the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> to perpetrate aggression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only purpose of the base as set out by  Mr Klass  is to prevent the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> from launching a sneak attack upon us or upon the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In point of fact, whether they know it or not, they have tried to encourage the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> in aggression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sovereignty did not pass to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, by the terms of the treaty, in respect of any islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-32-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister for the Navy give the House some indication of the very serious recent decline in the naval strength and sea power of the United States compared with that of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, in terms of other matters, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has been equipping its ships with surface to surface missiles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were informed through administration sources and the Australian Embassy in Washington that the  President  had made a decision that he would visit the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On what occasions has the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> evinced hostility to Australia of such a nature as to threaten us with aggression? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistently with this view Australia has supported moves to bring the matter before the United Nations, which, however, were successfully opposed by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and other supporters of North Viet-Nam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-34-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think something like 50,000 a week have been moved largely by the efforts of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> which has put in large passenger aircraft to help transport some of the war victims to the central States of India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we are talking about the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> Navy sailing its ships up and down the Indian Ocean we get terribly excited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our trade is growing with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and, as 1 said to this House only a week or so ago, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is now our second largest market for beef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that the honourable member visited the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> on his trip. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps if the Prime Minister had gone to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> or to Peking the honourable member would have been on his feet applauding him and saying what a good thing it was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a sphere in which I think undoubtedly the West has fallen behind the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> in thought and in evolution because it has stuck very largely to surface to air weapons, which are not especially designed to meet our purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he says there is no dissent, perhaps he should ask the Jewish people and those people who have moved out of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and the areas over which the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whenever he has been to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> there has been a revival within months of that visit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have heard it said that there is no threat to Australia from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us also remember that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has some perfectly legitimate interests in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, the Russians have no bases in the Indian Ocean, even in Indian ports, and India is the country which has just signed a treaty with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A new balance is emerging which includes the United States, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, the People’s Republic of China, Japan and the European community, including Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But beyond the indescribable sufferings facing millions of people in the subcontinent, it is essential that the great powers, particularly the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, the Peoples Republic of China and the United States, do not become further and directly involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have become used to taking for granted that if the United States and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> were determined to prevent or confine a war, their will would prevail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally significant about the new period and relationships is the fact that the first time China has acted in the Security Council she has aligned herself with the United States and Japan in opposition to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is a valued customer for Australian primary products and non-strategic goods generally, having consistently purchased large quantities of wool from Australia and, at various times, of wheat and meat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-32-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is never likely to be a threat to the integrity of Australia whereas Communist China might pose such a threat twenty or more years hence, will he do everything possible to encourage peaceful relations in trade, tourism, culture, medicine, literature and science with the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-32-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such visit is objectionable not only because of the treatment of political prisoners by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> but also because it may precipitate violence similar to that experienced during the South African Rugby Tour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-0-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the present situation of uncertainty about the intentions of China and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, and the aggressive militancy of the North Vietnamese throughout IndoChina, and widespread insurgency in our northern neighbourhood, a positive Australian policy founded on an adequate defence effort and on defence arrangements or understandings with our neighbours may contribute to confidence and stability in the region in which we live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To lay stress on dangerous contingencies against which Australian defence efforts must steadily prepare over the longer term is not inconsistent wi.h the hopes entertained by the  President  of the United States of progressively negotiating understandings which will reduce tensions among the 4 great powers: The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, the People’s Republic of China, the United States and Japan - and particularly among the 3 great military powers in this group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course the North Vietnamese are using tanks, but the problem is to get the supplies of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> out of the place and to get the American advisers out and bring the war to an end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We could and should be representing to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> that her massive and continuing support for North Vietnam is a massive contribution to a continuation of the war, to upgrading the level of violence of the war and the continuation of the bloodshed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nothing has characterised the hypocrisy of this Government over Vietnam more than its silence and its acquiescence on the role of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tanks, the surface-to-air missiles, or SAMs, all the sophisticated weaponry there now - the things that have made what was a guerrilla war into a massive war between 2 of the largest and best equipped armies of the world today - have been brought about not by China but by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and by the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I repudiate is any view which does not record our objection to and rejection of any action, by either side - not just by the Vietnamese but by all the powers, namely, the United States, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and China, who in pursuit of utterly mistaken ideas of national interest have hurled Indo-China into this crucible of blood - which prolongs the sacrifice and suffering of the people of Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister for Foreign Affairs inform the House what evidence his Department has been able to discover as to the amount of supplies being given to the North Vietnamese by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the qualification that one cannot guarantee the accuracy of the figures, I can say that the evidence at the moment points to the “fact that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> would have supplied aid to North Vietnam to the extent of SI, 000m in the past year whereas the People’s Republic of China would have provided aid to the extent of about $300m in that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second reason is to impress the allies of North Vietnam - ‘the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and the People’s Republic of China - of its capacity to strike at this time and to involve them, particularly at a time when the United States  President  is visiting the capitals of those 2 countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the House on 18th April 1972 in an earlier debate recorded on page 1694 of Hansard the Leader of the Opposition berated the Government for its silence and acquiescence on the role of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> who supply to the’ forces of North Vietnam arms such as the rockets that rain on to Saigon, and the pilots of the B52 bombers which are raining bombs on Hanoi and Haiphong, are killing ordinary people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Canada in the Pacific and Herr Brandt in the Atlantic community have been true friends of the United States because they have eased the United States’ path to sane relations, in the one case with China and in the other case with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, traders should be aware that the whole of the East European area, including the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, constitutes a very large market of some 350 million people whose rising incomes and living standards represent a valauble potential market for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Opposition approves of this development, and we note with interest that even in detail it accords with the position taken by the Opposition 5 or 6 years ago in respect of both the need to explore the realities of trade with the central European countries and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and the need to build into such trade the new negotiating principles and advisory bodies to take advantage of the kind of trade that the central European countries and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only regret that the Opposition has is that the initiative was not taken earlier because of an atmosphere of political prejudice, which seems to have prevailed in and around the Government, in which it was difficult for the Government to undertake trade with countries like Czechoslovakia and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and still to dispense the kind of foreign policy that it required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt has often been said that Australian government instrumentalities and other similar bodies are not anxious to accept or are not comfortable in accepting tenders from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> or from Czechoslovakia because these countries are not experienced in working in the Australian environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The basis of this detente is that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> could destroy China and could destroy the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to say to the honourable member for Henty that I think the assessment by his friend that the dispute between China and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is a dispute as to who is to be ‘the boss’ of the communist world is a very serious error in analysis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> suspected that Chinese policy over Cuba in  1962  was an attempt to involve the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> in a war with the United States in which they would both destroy one another, leaving China as the gainer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The analysis of the dispute between the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and China is not as trivial as the honourable member’s friend says. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many of the people in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> - Ukrainians, Georgians and so forth - in essence are colonial people and ideological comments from China aimed at those people are interpreted by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> as an attempt to disintegrate the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and the United States have for some years been searching for ways of reducing the tensions between them, particularly those tensions that have buttressed the super power confrontation and have from time to time erupted into serious disputes that exposed the danger of nuclear war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think we can all remember that, when the Mao Tse Tung administration took over in Peking at the end of 1949, it was the view of this Government and the United States Government that it was an agent for the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and that this was the eastwards thrust of Soviet Communism into China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That may be right or it may be wrong but they are certainly exercising a parental preference which is available to parents under this system in contrast to the system in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> where a great proportion of females work and State child-minding centres in which there are children in great numbers, are found in profusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is of interest to note that only today the Australian Wheat Board has reported a sale, the largest sale ever, to another Communist country, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, of one million tons of wheat for an approximate sum of $50m, and of course, that sale is for cash. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, we in Australia should be thinking not only of the need to look after country areas everywhere but in particular of the need to look after the country areas in the north - that is, in Queensland and if need be in the Northern Territory and the northern parts of Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite large increases in North Sea production, it appears likely that European natural gas imports from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and North Africa will increase and Shell T. and T.

    <p>We are doing everything we possibly can and are coming to secret agreement with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> so as to get the 3 Soviet votes - as honourable members know, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has 3 votes - necessary to enable Australia to be elected to the Security Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the ways in which we have been antagonising the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> up until now has been by accepting its political refugees into Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been alleged that for the next few months - until the vote for the Security Council is taken - the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> should not be antagonised and that the Department of Foreign Affairs has told the Department of Immigration that it should not be sympathetic to people whom the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> wants to exclude from membership of any outside nation - people whom it wants to get back into its own clutches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am happy about supporting the right of people to be out of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and in Australia, but we should not be giving them misinformation and pretending we support them while at the same time remaining silent in places where what is said really counts - in the United Nations - and making general statements simply to get support from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> on an issue that is not really terribly important to Australia, namely, whether Australia is to be a member of the Security Council next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, it is obvious from a list of Communist countries which have signed the agreements that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, Poland, Romania, Hungary and countries like that are just as concerned about hijacking as we are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no doubt about how we should regard the hijacking of planes for the purposes of extorting money or for any of the other purposes that have been raised by honourable members from both sides of the House today; but I can see the proposition that people might try to leave the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, East Germany or other countries such as these when there is no legal way in which they can do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a person who considers himself to be a political refugee has to take the step of hijacking a plane - let us say a plane going from Moscow to Warsaw - because he feels that this is the only way in which he can get out of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, and uses what we would all agree to be extremely unpleasant methods to force the pilot to fly that plane to Bonn, or some other city in West Germany or the nearest airport in a free country, are we prepared to say that that person is to be returned to that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was one man whose position gave him unique power to achieve these changes and I here gratefully acknowledge the pivotal role played by  President  Nixon in ushering in a new and saner phase in our relations with China; in clearing the way for more intensive commercial, scientific, technical and cultural exchanges between the United States of America and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, and thereby achieving a successful first round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and ending foreign intervention in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the contrary, what we have done is solidly based on a clear appreciation of the gradual but nevertheless real shift in international affairs which has been going on for years and which can be summed up as a change from the bipolar world which characterised the years of the Cold War to the multipolar world which emerged from such events as the split between the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and China, the integration of Europe through the European Common Market, the emergence of Japan as a major power and the Nixon Doctrine of greater self reliance in defence preparedness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And this is the main point - the information coming here to the United Nations was that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, while committed to reduce tensions under the Nixon-Brezhnev agreement, was actually urging Algeria, Lebanon and particularly the King of Jordan to get into the war against Israel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both the United States and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> are not as concerned today if smaller countries formerly in their orbit in the 1950s and 1960s move to non-alignment, neutrality or even to other coalitions mainly because military technology has limited the need for forward bases, not only for strategic deterrents but also for combat and reconnaisance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe too that the only way in which these goals can be achieved in the short and middle term is for the United States and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> to give such guarantees and to mean them; to refuse to arm and to train countries in the area to the extent that they could be posed as a threat to any other country, and to make it so clear that they are believed that if any future aggression does take place from any direction, they will act in concert to defeat it at once. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the  President  of the Australian Labor Party,  Mr Robert  Hawke, been an embarrassment to this country in presuming to undertake discussions between Israel and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> as a sort of roving, self-appointed diplomat? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Hawke has recently and in earlier years visited both Israel and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and had conversations with both the Prime Minister of Israel,  Mrs Golda  Meir, and with the trade union leader in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>,  Mr Shelepin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that any contacts which can be established between Israel and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> are valuable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that Israel and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> can restore diplomatic relations as Egypt and the United States have re-established diplomatic relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be supplying 20 per cent as that is the world average figure, excluding the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have a treaty with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> signed, I believe, by the former Government to which the honourable member for Mackellar belonged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did he say that he saw Australia moving towards the pattern in England and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> where only a few well-off people use private doctors? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has applied to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> under a government of one colour - and indeed under governments of one colour in other parts of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore said that I cannot foresee the day in this country when private practice will fall to a proportion as low as 10 per cent, which is the estimate in Britain and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has said that we will go in the direction of Britain and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has just recorded in Hansard, at my invitation, the fact that in his view it is not only inevitable but also desirable that in the future 80 per cent of Australians will attend for their medical care at a government run clinic where they will get their services free, where there will be no doctor-patient relationship, and that only 20 per cent, the very wealthy, will reserve the right to receive private treatment, as happens in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> in 1962 I was told that a Soviet geologist had done some research in Australia, with the authority of the Australian Government, and he had said there must be petroleum products off-shore and in the land mass of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those days it was regarded as politically traitorous to talk about the achievements of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has never been said in this House yet but I take the risk of saying - it is my own personal view - that if I thought something serious would happen to the Australian nation as a result of these people with the know-how - the multi-national corporations which are well equipped to search for oil - leaving us out in the cold in the search for oil, I would urge my Party to confer with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> with a view to using its geologists, its equipment and its know-how to search for petroleum products and natural gas on the Australian land mass or in the offshore regions of the Australian continent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> offered to drill for petroleum on behalf of those countries and said it would not lay any claim to the petroleum it found. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of this offer by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> the international petroleum company supplying petroleum products to India and Pakistan reduced the price of its products so that those countries would not show interest in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> carrying out further searches for oil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the international consortiums are going to leave us out in the cold they should be told that there are members of the Australian Parliament who are prepared to ask the Government to reconsider its attitude on asking the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> to search for petroleum in our region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There  Mr Solzhenitsyn  and other people find themselves amenable to quite drastic penalties because they have written something which offends the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>; in fact, they have engaged in what is known as anti-communist propaganda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is the prospect of the development of a new relationship between the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and Japan particularly in the development of Siberia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The recent Middle East crisis raised a new element of uncertainty in relations between the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is military significance in any such proposals from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> or from anybody else it is most unlikely that the proposals will be accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A major feature of last October’s conflict in the Middle East from our strategic point of view was the manner in which the United States of America and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> successfully managed the crisis in their relations and used their influence to limit the conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will encourage and support measures designed to remove tension amongst all states’ and welcomes the moves by the United States and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> to stabilise their strategic relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My good friend, the honourable member for Wentworth, will concede that in terms of international law, conflict of laws, private international law, call it what you will, Victoria and New South Wales are as foreign as France and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has demonstrated the most utter hypocrisy in regard to human rights and I think it is time that the Government officially associated itself with a protest in the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask now that the Government officially bring to the notice of the United Nations the consistent violation of all human rights which the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is perpetrating against its .own citizens inside its own borders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to make this kind of protest against one nation, let us make it against the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that when these matters are raised the represenatives of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> in the United Nations in the past have used the elegant phrase: ‘Let them keep their pig snouts out of our Soviet garden’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third point I make is that the Government should use its resources to see that people in Australia are better informed about factual developments inside the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Censorship in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> even extends sometimes to prohibition of normal Soviet newspapers reaching us in time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have an embassy in Moscow and it should be used to see that proper factual information about what is happening inside the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> reaches us here in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if we do this we are entitled to ask for equal opportunity for our diplomats and our representatives - whether they be private citizens or government officials - inside the borders of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the Government recognised the de jure incorporation of the 3 republics in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> there had been representations by Australia’s representatives to the Soviet Government alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is deluding and deceiving people from those countries who have settled in Australia to give them the impression that any Australian government would promote the detachment of those countries from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that for their own temporary domestic purposes members of the Opposition have from time to time suggested that Croatia should be detached from Yugoslavia, that Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania should be liberated from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since we have recognised the de jure incorporation of the 3 republics in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> we have been able to make representations on such state matters as we call them on behalf of people in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the 3 countries are under the domination of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to such things as the Ermolenko affair, which was very hard to understand; to the recognition of the incorporation of the Baltic States, de jure, into the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, which was almost impossible to understand; to discriminatory help given to certain organisations in Africa which are called liberation movements but which are actually rather communist inclined; to the incident, which I cannot, of course, go into much further because of the security aspects, of the refusal of asylum to a diplomat from the Eastern European communist bloc in Australia only recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the governments of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and the United States of America accept the Australian Government’s request in March 1974 that they consult with a view to agreeing to exercise initial restraint in the growth of forces in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-52-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Governments of the United States and of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> both agreed to consider the appeal we made to them in March 1 974 to enter into discussions on mutual restraint in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-52-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In March 1974 Australian representatives in Washington and Moscow re- quested the Governments of the United States and te <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> respectively to consult with each other with a view to reaching agreement on mutual restraint in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-52-16">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He should tell that to the Latvians; he should tell that to the Lithuanians; he might also tell it to the Estonians, whose aspirations for independence the Government has denied with the stroke of a pen when recognising the incorporation of those states into the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very movement of an accredited diplomat into any area of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is in reality an acceptance of the control of that country over the various territories of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is all it has said, but the Government has never said that it agreed with the manner in which the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> brutally took over the Baltic states. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the war the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> had direct control over those territories, and the only way Australia can operate in those territories on behalf of the Baltic people in Australia is through the recognition of that control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If that was the situation, should we condone the brutal overtaking of those States by now recognising them as part of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Prior to the recognition of the incorporation of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania into the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> as de jure incorporation, there was no extradition treaty in force between Australia and the U.S.S.R. Australian citizens wishing to visit the three Baltic States had to apply to a Soviet Embassy or Consulate for a visa, and a person residing in one of the three Baltic States who wished to enter Australia as a migrant had to comply with the relevant provisions of Soviet law regarding exit permits and had to apply to the Australian Embassy in Moscow for a migrant visa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-44-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last week, as I informed the House, a senior official from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> discussed with me the subjects which we would be raising, and this was one that I mentioned to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As for a zone of peace, it is perfectly obvious that if there are 2 superpowers, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and the People’s Republic of China, in competition with each other and if they both have naval forces in the Indian Ocean the threat to Australia can come from the ripples of competition between those 2 superpowers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 12 January I flew to Leningrad and 2 days later to Moscow where I had wide-ranging discussions with  President  Podgorny and Prime Minister Kosygin of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, and signed cultural and scientific agreements between the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we have an opportunity to develop trade with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> we should explore it immediately because there is a market there for our products and we ought to do it in the interests of producers both in the primary field and in the secondary field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Prior to the Prime Minister’s visit an Australian Prime Minister had never visited Ireland, Italy, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> or Yugoslavia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point was that the Prime Minister had raised with the Prime Minister of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> the question of Jewish emigration and the question of the emigration of Soviet citizens to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Can honourable members tell me that any predecessor of the Prime Minister from the other side fo the House would have gone to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and- I will put it in pretty blunt Australian terms- had the guts to raise in that environment the issue that Prime Minister Whitlam raised? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because we can put propositions and we do put propositions- on Diego Garcia, on Jewish emigration from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>- that we have rightfully earned the respect of the world powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are such things as Polaris submarines in the Indian Ocean, so arranged there that they constitute a threat not only to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> but also to China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We put a very simple proposition to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and to the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We did not put it just to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and forget about the United States, nor did we put it to the United States and forget the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a tragedy that in the speech just given to us by the Minister for Science  (Mr Morrison)  he did not realise the degree to which in seeking the respect of the United States and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, which he asserts his Government has gained, he does not realise the realities of even the visit we are discussing presently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of interest that in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> members of the Press who accompanied the Prime Minister found themselves so critical of KGB surveillance and that the Prime Minister himself found it necessary to take a debugging expert with him to ensure that those conversations which he wanted to have in private were in fact private. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We could find ourselves involved in an agreement, which we do not like, with the United States of America, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> or a number of countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is also true that one company submitted a tender involving the supply of pumps manufactured in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and motors manufactured in Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does he realise that if these problems had gone to the United Nations there would have been obstruction not from the Australian Government of 1972 and preceding years but from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, Australia’s security, as with the peace of the world, rests ultimately upon making the detente between the United States and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> a success and upon associating China in a wider detente. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this Parliament on more than one occasion he has blamed the South rather than the North, the United States rather than the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances, who is in breach of the Agreements and why does the Prime Minister seek to blame the United States rather than North Vietnam or the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States has drawn the attention of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, China and other countries to the actions of North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Prime Minister, as I understand it, has said very little to anyone other than Saigon and the United States and has ignored the actions of North Vietnam and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, which are the 2 parties principally responsible for the situation that has developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the contacts that he has made in many countries- in Hanoi, Peking, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and Eastern Europe- are of any account surely his voice is one that could be heard with power and influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government should approach the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and China to seek observance of the Paris Accords. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>North Vietnam tends to look to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> for help, aid and military supplies much more than it does to China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With some of the largest armies in the world, it is still likely to be closer to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> than to China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it could be achieved, if it was a reality, maybe it is an objective worth pursuing, but he ought to know that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has no intention of allowing that to occur, and he also knows quite well that other measures are needed to be taken as a consequence of that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chinese see the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> as attempting an encirclement of China, and that will lead to countervailing action and competition on the mainland of South-East Asia and in other parts of South-East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or is it just something which the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> uses to help disarm the democracies, to help establish the circumstances in which soft spots will develop around the world where it can probe further and further, as I believe it has done in the Middle East and SouthEastAsia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What protests have been registered with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and the People’s Republic of China which continue to supply the Government of North Vietnam with arms? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The folk who put forward that proposition completely ignore the fact that there is probably as much difference between the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and the United States as there is between the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and Communist China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Khmer Rouge is a national communist group, and although during the period of fighting the North Vietnamese have had to make their accommodations with the Chinese communists and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, the differences are fundamental. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, the inclinations of the Government of North Vietnam have been contributed to in an alarming degree by the Government of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and the Government of the People ‘s Republic of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The laws of New South Wales and Victoria and Western Australia and Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, to go on without mentioning all of them, are as different from each other for practical and legal purposes as the law of Paraguay is different from the law of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and are treated as such in terms of public international law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If North Vietnam stands aside from that dispute it might be a different matter, but hitherto the North Vietnamese have been closer to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> than to China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is with some degree of regret that I listened to the honourable member for Ryan  (Mr Drury),  a man who is generally respected by all members of the House, giving what I consider to be a one-sided version of life in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that most members of this House would not like to live in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, but for the past 50 years that country has been pioneering another political system against hes, subterfuge and great position from the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remember that on my first visit to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> I was most anxious to see the kindergartens because I had been brainwashed and led to believe that the children there were taken away from their parents, against the parents’ wishes, and brought up in and brainwashed to the communist system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I found that working couples voluntarily allowed their children to go to the kindergartens because those couples placed a high degree of importance on producing essential goods for the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During question time the diplomats were asked whether it was true that women worked in all types of professions in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, and whether this was necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the diplomats answered the questions very courteously by saying that more women worked in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> that probably in any other country in the world, the reason being that when they were at war as our allies against the tyranny of Nazi Fascism, so many of their men were in the fighting forces that it was necessary for the women to do the men’s jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then, the diplomat added in conclusion that women in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> worked for the same reasons as women worked in Australia, that is, to get extra money for the household. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose that he has been a little self-conscious knowing that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> for many years has been buying considerable quantities of Australian wool which the people in his electorate produce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As well as criticising the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, they should point out the things that are praiseworthy in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have tried to balance the submissions he made to the Parliament by giving something which is favourable to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and of which I believe the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is worthy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Goodness me, as if applying that charge was not bad enough, apparently the Government now is saying that, in respect of that $3m that apparently it is lending to the Meat Board to offset freight costs for that rather unfortunate sale to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, it will place a levy on the beef producer to pay for that as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Whitlam Labor Government tries to make changes, tries to develop treaty relationships and tries to develop the legal apparatus appropriate for an independent nation- not for 8 different nations; not for New South Wales as a nation and Victoria as a nation, each as different from the other as France is different from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, as the members of the Opposition would sometimes like them to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-81-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to say that again: The Australian Governmentthe Australian Labor Party- in terms of the global balance, the nuclear deterrent- the big league, if you like, of nuclear balance between the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and the US- is fundamentally aligned with the US. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the last decade, while the United States has continued to maintain a parity at the atomic and hydrogen level, at the conventional military level the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has moved into a position of quantitative superiority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am merely stating a fact that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> today does give the impression to the world of a nation which is determined whereever possible, whenever the opportunities arise, to make use of them to turn a situation to its own advantage and therefore to increase its own international prestige and influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe quite firmly that if the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> increases its influence in South-East Asia, through North Vietnam for example, a point will be reached where China might well have to consider taking action in its own interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The one thing that China is terrified of today is that it is going to be surrounded by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, its growing navy and its satellites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is the Russian equivalent of the CIA-  is inside the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, but its international operation is small compared with the CIA. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>De Gaulle was the first significant foreign affairs spokesman to recognise the significance of China’s fear of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>China, studying the possibility of her own destruction, decided that the United States could not destroy China but that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> could, and that the Soviet occupation of Hungary and Czechoslovakia was a claim to supervise other communist powers in the way that everybody supervised China in the nineteenth century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>China, finding this prospect intolerable, broke with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the developing tensions, this obliged the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> to concentrate a couple of million troops on Russia’s Far Eastern border. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The NATO headquarters was in France, and it finally came to the point where de Gaulle needed to ask a straight question: ‘If, because of the presence of these headquarters, or because of the position of France in the alliance, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> were to land a few nuclear missiles on France, would the United States retaliate on her behalf?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very large French naval forces in the Indian Ocean, which at first sight is an ocean that appears to have absolutely nothing to do with the strategic defence of Fance, are there simply so that nuclear missiles on submarines or on other vehicles are deployed on Soviet Donets Basin cities so that if the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> were to use nuclear weapons on France, France might have this deterrent to be able to retaliate and not be beholden in any way to the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has become part of the mythology in this country that we have an automatic guarantee that if the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> were to land one on North West Cape the United States would retaliate on our behalf and sentence to death some millions of New Yorkers, San Franciscans and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is generally accepted that the submarine missiles of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> do not have the range of the submarine missiles of the U.S.A. but they are sufficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> actually wished to attack Cockburn Sound- I am not suggesting that it would at the moment- it could do it from off Capetown, from the Antarctic, from 2000 miles north of Singapore or from 800 miles east of Wellington, New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It follows from this that even though the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> may be mistaken in this view the fact has to be recognised that rightly or wrongly it does hold this view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the  chairman  of the military committee of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation pointed out last December, an intelligence analysis of Warsaw Pact military developments has discerned only one trend in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and her satellites- a steady and continuous improvement in both the quality and quantity of weapons, equipment and training with growing emphasis on offensive capability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular the presence of Cuban troops acting as agents for the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, and also Soviet weaponry, made this impossible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the basic document of  detente,  ‘The Statement of Basic Principles of United States-Soviet Relations 1972’, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> together with the United States promised to ‘attach major importance to preventing the development of situations capable of causing a dangerous exacerbation of their relations’, and recognised that ‘efforts to obtain unilateral advantage at the expense of the other, directly or indirectly’ were inconsistent with the objectives of  detente. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While it is possible that the involvement of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and Cuba in deterrnining the outcome of the struggle in Angola grew with events and opportunity as much as or more than it was a deliberate attempt to steal a march on and humiliate the United States, it is difficult to see how the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>’s unprecedented and significant military incursion into southern Africa can be squared with that basic statement of principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is difficult also to see how the image of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> as a conservative,  status quo,  defensively-minded state- an image which has often been projected lately, not least when the Soviet presence in the Indian Ocean is under discussion- can be reconciled with this deliberate projection of its power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The particular sources of concern with the proposals, which I am advised did become law on 14 February of this year are, firstly, the description of Poland as a ‘socialist state’; secondly, a reference to the Polish United Workers Partythat is, of course, the Communist Party- as the leading political force in the country; thirdly, a reference to Poland’s alliance with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>; and, fourthly, a clause that would have made citizens’ rights contingent upon their fulfilling duties towards the state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I was in Europe in June last year I was approached- because the discussions were more or less on a confidential level I feel that I am not free to name the people who spoke to me- by people who stated that all the leading people in European shipping are concerned about the way the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is expanding its shipping operations throughout the world today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the attitude of the Minister for Transport and the Government as a whole, the Minister for Defence should have added that with the entry of FESCO into Australian trading we welcome our great friend the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> into Australian trade and its use of Australian ports, because that is what it means to have Australian ports used by Soviet shipping. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> will not face total war- none of us would want that to happenbecause, with the use of today’s weapons, little would be left of civilisation or, indeed, of humanity if such a thing were to occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know whether this is really a conscious attempt by our Department of Foreign Affairs or whether it is just a preference by the new Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  who has always been closer to the peasants and therefore prefers the Chinese regime to that of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The facts of life are that in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> one does not have any say, and one does not have any say in many other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendment also included the incorporation into the constitution of an official eternal alliance with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or, to use the original wording, to make the constitution reflect the ‘unshakable fraternal bond’ with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Regarding Poland’s place in the socialist community, the revised wording of the constitution omits reference to an ‘unshakable fraternal bond’ with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and simply states that Poland ‘strengthens its friendship and cooperation with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and other socialist states’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although some minor liberalisation of citizens ‘ rights and duties was achieved, the basic points- that is, the socialist character of the state, the role of the Polish United Workers Party and the country’s reliance on the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> for political support and defence- remain in force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In attacking the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> the Fraser Government is antagonising one of the two mightiest powers in the world, and a major trading partner of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In its most recent survey the International Institute for Strategic Studies notes that in the last year ‘the overall perception of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> in the West was perhaps the most anxious for many years’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For him, to take note of what the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is doing and to consider its implications is to ‘insult’ the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While there is an obvious need for continuing surveillance to be carried out over Australian waters and the adjacent region, to create public concern that Australia is suddenly confronted with a threat from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> or any other power serves only as a contribution to the undermining of efforts of reasonable men in all great powers to bring about a genuine relaxation of tensions and progress towards a better relationship between those powers in a position to threaten the security of our globe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I shall cite some figures of exports from Australia to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> in recent years and the exports to Australia from the Soviet Unionthe country that was unjustifiably kicked about in the statement made to the Parliament by the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1971-72 the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> imported from Australia $82.8m worth of goods and we imported from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> $1.8m worth of goods- a balance in our favour of $81m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1972-73 Australia exported to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> $ 123.6m worth of goods and imported from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> $2.9m worth of goods- a balance of trade in Australia’s favour of $ 120.7m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Parliament and I ask honourable members: Is it fair to start this warmongering and unfair criticisms of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> because she has put naval vessels in the international waters of the Indian Ocean? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only a few months ago the rural people of Australia and the beef producers who are in a tragic plight sold 40 000 tons of Australian frozen beef to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has one of its naval vessels in Portsmouth Harbour on a goodwill mission to our mother country, Great Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand the Prime Minister of Australia has launched this vicious and unfair criticism of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and has accused it of warmongering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That brings to my mind the tragic embarrassment that Anthony Eden- and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>- in the late 1960s when 2 Russian naval vessels were visiting Britain on a goodwill mission with the Premier of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>,  Mr Bulganin,  and a British skindiver was detected obviously interfering with the bottom of these Soviet warships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>After more than a century of exploitation by colonialist powers, and economic disruption at the hands of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, the Chinese economy has been set upon the course of self-reliance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 4 countries are Canada, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, Mainland China and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The person responsible for recognising the brutal suppression of the Baltic states by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> can in no sense be described as someone who is genuinely interested in freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suggestions have been made that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is tending to move into the control of the world’s gold reserves and production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That strategy has been evidenced by a variety of moves by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> aimed ultimately at reinstituting an international gold standard, with Russia itself as the major holder and producer of the metal and as the heir apparent to the United States as the monetary strong man of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first option which faces the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> in moving towards a position of monopoly in the production of the world ‘s new gold would be the fall of Rhodesia, followed by the fall of South Africa, to Soviet controlled communists groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second option, and a much more likely one, is for the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> to try to disrupt the supply of gold production through the support of terrorist or guerrilla activities or to disrupt the exports of gold flowing from South Africa by means of border harassments and possibly through a sea lane blockade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> would achieve many of the same benefits which Britain first achieved during the 19th century, when it virtually controlled the world’s gold supply and which the United States achieved in the postWorld War I period up to the 1960s; that is, a continuous flow of real resources to those countries as others sought to exchange with them to possess the gold-convertible pounds and dollars and perhaps, in the future, roubles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and its satellite territories are presently indebted to Western financial institutions to the tune of around $35 billion, the major portion of that debt being owed by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has also been suggested that perhaps the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is buying up the gold being sold by the International Monetary Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They share the attitude of the Australian Labor Party and  Senator Sim-  a senator from the Government’s own benches- that there is no reason to be particularly alarmed about the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>’s activities in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First, it has strained relations with a major trading partner, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, which as recently as yesterday responded by accusing Australia of stepping up the arms race and heightening tension within the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I call for support from every member of this House, particularly the members of the National Country Party whose leader was in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> quite recently to negotiate further trade for the country people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is also interesting to note that those bases on our territory are in fact supplied by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> by way of Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that initially the planes, that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> used- it has planes regularly coming and going from the area- would have flown through South Africa but probably today they fly through Mozambique. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1 975-76 we exported to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> wool, wheat, barley, oats and meat to the value of $37 1 m. That is important for them and important for us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the key global elements of that agenda, using the terminology of the Carter team- do not ask me to spell it all out extensively in the time available for questions without notice, or in any order of priorityare, firstly, a cooler hard-headed approach to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>; secondly, a stress on reducing the proliferation of nuclear weapons; thirdly, the building up of core alliances with democratic countries, which  Mr Carter  describes as a democratic concert and in which he includes quite specifically, Australia; fourthly, greater stress, to use his terminology, on global issues, and in particular the north-south dialogue; and finally, and this is by no means unimportant, the belief that there is a need to get a firm domestic base for his foreign policies by making these policies reflect, as he puts it, the moral values of the American people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At any chance it has a jibe at the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> yet its Ministers are still trotting off to Moscow and trying to arrange meat quotas, meat imports, in order to save their bacon back in what they believe are traditionally National Country Party electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If China and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> had a common policy, as they did up till about 1958, 1 think that it would be extremely difficult for the United States and for countries associated with the United Statesthe democratic countries of the world- to stand up to pressure from the 2 communist super powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only basis on which I would think it would be reasonable to support China  vis-a-vis  the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is that the Chinese appear to be weaker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said, however, that he thought it was of great international significance that the conflict between the People’s Republic of China and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> should continue, the inference being, of course, that were there to be established between the Government of Peking and the Government of Moscow a rapport and an understanding the probability would be that there would be a greater threat in the world because those 2 governments would be so powerful- in truth, two super-powers combined- that the rest of the world would need to tremble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What this Government has put forward is that a zone of peace will not be created by one nation but by the co-operation of many nations and particularly of two of the major nations- the United States of America and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have said is that if there is no indication of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> accepting its responsibilities, the only answer to that is that the United States and other nations must take precautionary measures to see that there is no advantage to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the pretence of freedom, we know that there are inside the borders of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> discrimination, persecution and worse of all who profess any religion because, as Lenin said, communism is necessarily militant atheism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are making their presence felt and they are getting some protection inside the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> for the practice of their religion because they have stuck together and they are demanding that they have freedom for religious practice and worship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some of these people in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> had had the tremendous courage to face martyrdom to face deprivation, to face discrimination, to face persecution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-The short answer is that discussions of significant moment are taking place at present between the Secretary of State for the United States of America and the Government of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But, after all, what he said was a reiteration of what the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has been saying for some time; that it favours demilitarisation and that it wishes to have a zone of peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this context our officials on occasions have had discussions with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> as to just what this means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, my former Permanent Head put to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>: ‘Does it mean that you agree to the dismantling of your base at Berbera?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘No’, said the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, ‘because it is not our base; it is a Somali base’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must await the reaction of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> to the proposal enunciated by the American President and discussed in somewhat greater detail by the Secretary of State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until that time I think it would be wiser for countries outside the 2 super powersthe United States of America and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>- not to do any more than the form of exploratory discussions that officers in my Department have had with representatives of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But clearly there will need to be, either during this period of talks with the United States or at some future date, if it is agreed that there be further discussions on the Indian Ocean, an acceptance publicly by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> that the base in Somalia is in fact what most would accept it to be, a Soviet controlled entity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps he was referring to Press reports that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> might give aid to some South Pacific countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would hardly be stretching it to describe this treatment of the Australian Parliament as being most discourteous and lacking any element of the co-operative spirit underpinning the Helsinki Pact about which the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has been so sanctimonious lately in respect of  President  Carter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The issue of human rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and in other countries has concerned me and I have placed a question on notice for the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  seeking information on the number of political prisoners in every country on which information can be obtained and I eagerly await that reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To return to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, I have received on a regular basis a document called  Survey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have just received the March 1977 issue of  Survey,  volume 2 number 12, which has as a standard subheading on all issues, the following words: ‘A monthly digest of trends in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and other socialist countries.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the front page of this special issue under the heading ‘Human Rights and Socialism’ the statement is made that in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> there is ‘the right to freedom of religion’, which of course stands most peculiarly alongside the correspondence I have just mentioned from the Soviet Embassy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, it seems to me that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is jeopardising detente and world peace and is curiously supersensitive on the issue of human rights when it complains so bitterly about  President  Carter’s comments on Soviet dissidents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However brilliant  Mr Herman  Eiltz, the United States Ambassador in Cairo, however good the United States Minister for Foreign Affairs, however brilliant  Mr Stoltfuss  in the Gulf, and however wonderful the diplomats, it seems to me historically impossible to hope for any solution unless the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is brought into the discussions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1976, because of the nonsense about saying to the people in the sugar production business that everything was rosy, because of the failure to look at the fact that the European Common Market was expanding its production and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> had expanded its production and because of the failure to recognise the fact that Cuba was coming back into the international market and was no longer going to maintain its exclusiveness with respect to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, we did not have the courage to tell the growers of Australia that there would be an over supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In respect of trading relations with Japan, again I find the Opposition’s claims rather paradoxical and amusing because it has said this afternoon that it is not the function of the Government to try to bully our various trading partners, whether it is Japan, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, the European Economic Community or whatever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is seeking a fishery agreement with us and has made specific overtures to participate, alone with Australian partners, in fishing within Australia’s proposed 200-mile zone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These areas are already being exploited by fishermen from Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia, Japan and the maritime province of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, even in areas inside the 12-mile zone where the waters are generally less than 200 metres deep and contain the valuable demersal fisheries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both countries have a high stake in the security and prosperity of other economically advanced democratic powers in the world; in the continuation of the process of detente between the super-powers; in maintaining an open and nondiscriminatory regime in international trade; in encouraging a continuing United States presence in the Asia-Pacific region to the extent necessary to maintain a sound balance in that region; in opposing any attempt by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>- or any other major power- to establish hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region; and in encouraging China to continue to play a constructive role in regional affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At last year’s General Assembly, the documents of which are again public documents, Australia was instrumental in efforts to secure the adoption of a single nuclear test ban resolution, supported by the overwhelming majority of the Assembly, and for the first time, by the United States and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A comprehensive test ban treaty now under negotiation between the United States, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and Britain would be an important barrier both to the spread of nuclear weapons and to the expansion of existing arsenals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note that  President  Carter has said that an ultimate decision on production and deployment of a new weapon- the neutron bombwould be influenced by the degree to which the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> shows restraint in its conventional and nuclear arms programs and force deployments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I understand it,  Dr Orlov  is the leader of a group within the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> that has been monitoring the Helsinki agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in general all I can say is that  Dr Orlov  ‘s trial and sentence certainly will serve to qualify Western confidence that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> intends to honour its commitments on the implementation of human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One sympathises, of course, with his views on civil rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and such places but Indonesia, which is much closer to home - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the only group in this country which is actively supporting the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is the Opposition in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the honourable member for Denison  (Mr Hodgman),  who on 30 May launched a vicious attack against the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is right or wrong I think it ill behoves a supporter of the Government to attack the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, a friendly nation, in the manner in which he did when one takes into consideration what is happening in some of the nations more friendly towards Australia, such as Indonesia which is at our doorstep. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that these countries should have deserved the withering attack of the honourable member for Denison before the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He bitterly and unjustifiably, in my view, attacked the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Yes, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is right at the end of the list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has its faults; so have we. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, outside those figures the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and other eastern European countries also have large nuclear power programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in October 1977 the sub-committee on human rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> of the Parliament’s Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence widened its initial terms of reference to include the following:  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>human rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> bearing in mind Australia’s support for the principles contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the final act of the Helsinki Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was told that no one could doubt that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> was sincere about the implementation of the Helsinki Declaration and he was warned that the formation of the group was unconstitutional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sub-committee on human rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> will shortly prepare a report on the subject of human rights in the USSR. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recent trial of Yuri Orlov and the sentence imposed on him have damaged the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> because it appears that Orlov has been tried for the holding and disseminating of unpopular opinions, something with which we in the Australian Labor Party are all too familiar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was impressed too with the view of leading experts in international affairs in China when they said that the Western world today does not appreciate the threat posed by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> through its activities in Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he has received a report on the trial, does it indicate whether the trial accords with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>’s claim to be taking human rights more seriously in accordance with its minimal Helsinki Pact obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-59-94">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concern has been expressed from time to time since the end of the Vietnam conflict that Russia might gain access to Cam Ranh Bay as a major addition to its own shore based facilities, thus enormously increasing the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>’s strategic reach into the Pacific and linking up the Soviet facilities at Vladivostok and in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we know that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has a great capacity to maintain ships at sea for long periods and can reach into any part of the world from its present facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But another major land based facility at Cam Ranh Bay would enormously increase the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>’s capacity to reach out with great strength. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But activities of recent times by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> have not given us great cause to be confident that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> shares that particular objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A major development at Cam Ranh Bay by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> would be such a development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to that unsettling factor, we have the fact that the move would inevitably tend to push Vietnam towards closer and closer links with the <span class="highlight">Soviet union</span> in contradistinction with its relations with China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only say that that is typical of the view that has been taken by the Leader of the Opposition and by his predecessors over a great many years- that an extension of power and influence by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> does not create instability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That kind of attitude in relation to the extension of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>’s influence needs to stand in stark contrast with the Opposition ‘s general criticism of the efforts of the United States whenever that country undertakes initiatives designed to maintain balance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Government has to make a choice, in blunt and plain terms, between naval facilities under the control of the United States and those under the control of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, I guarantee that we would prefer those facilities under the control of the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not wish to see an extension of major facilities under the control of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> that would upset the strategic balance and which would, at the same time, be viewed with great disfavour by ASEAN countries and which would lead to the possibility of political instability of a very serious kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only yesterday I think it was I heard the Prime Minister answer a question in the House in respect of one of our trading partners- a country from which I have only recently returned- the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780817_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister could not be disparaging enough about the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780817_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He had no consideration of the fact that there is a great imbalance of trade between Australia and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>- an imbalance which is greatly in Australia’s favour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780817_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is to the tune of $400m exports to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and about $4m imports from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780817_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Plans are going ahead for grounds of the same standard in other countries such as New Zealand, India, Pakistan and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unhappily, the so-called non-aligned have much too often, especially in recent years, been non-aligned against the United States and on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> in every world forum and on every world issue of consequence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst Tito may now be offside with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> this was not always the case- so, friendships do change all the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Vietnam is a country which is striving to maintain its independence and freedom from all sides whether it be China or the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> on the one hand or the United States on the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In olden days I think the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> used to have a slogan to the effect that the world was divided into two camps: On the one hand there were imperialist powers and, on the other hand, there were peace-loving countries led by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take considerable support from honourable members such as the honourable member for McMillan  (Mr Simon)  and others in this Parliament who for a long time have been concerned about the question of human rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I mention for the purpose of comparison that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>’s reserves total 18 trillion, or 18 million million, cubic metres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is exporting only 8 per cent of its annual yield of 0.345 trillion cubic metres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This honourable gentleman from Bendigo asks about the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The truth is that more than half of all the enriched uranium in Western Europe is treated in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development wish to have uranium enriched in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> everything seems to be all right, but when the honourable member for Bendigo wishes to indulge in a Red witch hunt he likes to make what he calls his personal score, making innuendoes against me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have found markets also in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and in the Middle East countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst I criticise our system in Australia for overeducation, I think I have seen a greater measure of it in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> system is probably showing the benefit of that over-emphasis on education because at present it appears to be the leader in the scientific field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Speaker, the honourable gentleman certainly would not for one moment have raised this question, for example, if a number of members on his own side of the House had organised a dinner with representatives of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> or of other countries, and I would not take it as a mark of criticism if they had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, whatever happens it is essential that the United States and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> lend their efforts to bring a halt to the complete dismemberment of the Lebanon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If anybody imagines that it is going to be possible to bring a peaceful solution to the Middle East without consulting the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> directly or indirectly he must be gravely mistaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To leave the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> out of any discussions concerning the Middle East must indeed be a mistake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A further possible threat in the future could come from attempts by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> to destabilise the South East Asian region in order to encircle or contain China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781025_reps_31_hor111/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Human Rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>  (Question No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The issue of human rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is one which has drawn the particular attention of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has called on the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> to implement the important principles of human rights embodied in United Nations instruments as well as the 197S Helsinki Accords. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s stand on human rights will be maintained into 1980 (when the Olympic Games are to be held in Moscow) and for as long as basic human rights are denied in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> or elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-33">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The World Peace Council can proudly list its achievements as failure to protest about the Berlin Wall, failure to protest about the invasion of Hungary and Czechoslovakia and its rather dubious protest about nuclear testing, forgetting altogether that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is perhaps the greatest nuclear tester of all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It need scarcely be emphasised that hostile intelligence activities detract seriously from the purpose of improving and developing relations between the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and Australia, a purpose to which the Australian Government has been diligently directing its efforts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will see just how frequently not a single member of the Liberal Party or the National Country Party attends meetings of that sub-committee, which was set up following a resolution of this chamber to investigate the question of human rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>involving persecution of dissidents in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is on a substantive matter, is addressed to the Prime Minister and is subsequent to a number of petitions I have presented to the House concerning human rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Prime Minister inform the House of the Government’s attitude towards the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>’s attempts to deny the rights and liberties of those of its citizens wishing to exercise the democratic rights of free expression and peaceful dissent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have urged the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> to implement important principles of human rights embodied in the Helsinki Accords, and if that could occur I am quite certain that the thrust for peace throughout the world would be enormously strengthened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only implication from that can be that that conference of the Victorian Labor Party was supporting the actions of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labor Party to reject that motion condemning Soviet actions against the dissidents in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> on the grounds that these people would prefer to believe what the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, what communist Russia itself, said about the dissidents is, I believe, a totally unreasonable situation and one that would be widely condemned throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker,  in view of answers given at Question Time, I ask whether you will investigate why an undertaking was given by the Department of Foreign Affairs to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> that no members of the Joint Foreign Affairs and Defence Sub-Committee on Human Rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> would be included in any parliamentary delegation to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made reference to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and to the sub-committee which is chaired by  Senator Wheeldon  and which is currently investigating human rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In moving that motion the  speaker  made a very specific reference to the position in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and referred to the Dinzburg trial in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made generalised allegations that members on this side of the House were not concerned about the question of human rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the world has been deploring in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is happening in Australia: The Soviet Communist Party is putting in gaol people who have the honesty and courage to publicly criticise the party line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday during Question Time in this House we heard the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  call for human rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, a nation as far from Australia’s influence as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am comparing the position with that in other parts of Australia, not the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has served notice on the people of Victoria not only in relation to the nationalisation issue, but also in relation to the question of dissidents and human rights for all those those within Victoria who might have come from Eastern Europe as well as members of religious communities who are not given adequate rights within the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I refer the Minister for Foreign Affairs to his answer to a question on 14 November indicating that a review of relations with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> took place in June. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do these letters give approval in principle for toll enrichment in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> of Australian uranium purchased by Finland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the review of relations with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> encompass this question? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>why an undertaking was given by the Department of Foreign Affairs to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> that no members of the Joint Foreign Affairs and Defence Sub-committee on Human Rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> would be included in any parliamentary delegation to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I understand it, one of our officials was told at a social function by a middle ranking Soviet official that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> could have a certain attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interesting thing is that this is the first time that members of this Parliament sitting opposite have taken such a viewpoint of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliamentary delegation that went to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> could have been looked upon as one that was elected to comply with the wishes of the middle order official from the Soviet Embassy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Corio made an incorrect statement last week when he said that the Department of Foreign Affairs gave an undertaking to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> that no members of the Joint Foreign Affairs and Defence Subcommittee on Human Rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> would be included in any parliamentary delegation to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are those with a genuine concern regarding the suppression of civil liberties, as epitomised by the honourable member for Prospect, and there are those who need to aspire to the desires of others who would seek to suppress criticism of the suppression of civil liberties in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, namely, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports  (Mr Holding)  who goes along with the socialists in Victoria who would not condemn the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> for its brutal suppression of civil liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some few moments ago in a speech to the House by the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)-  perhaps it was an exercise in the honourable gentleman’s forensic skills- he described members of the Australian Labor Party as being of two kinds: Those who were genuinely concerned with problems of civil liberties and those who, to quote the Minister’s words, were concerned to suppress evidence of oppression of dissident groups within the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, only this morning in another article in the  Australian Financial Review  I noticed that  Mr John  Silkin, the United Kingdom Minister for Agriculture, Food and Fisheries remarked on the fact that the EEC has sold subsidised butter to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> at a price of about 47.5 pence a pound compared with 60 pence a pound paid by British shoppers for the same product. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without wishing to disclose the price that has been received in the recent sale of Australian butter to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> I think it is apparent that Australia’s ability to sell agricultural produce in Third World markets is seriously prejudiced by the maintenance of the very high subsidies on European produce that is applied through the Common Agricultural Policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-In recent months mankind right around the world has strongly and vociferously condemned the systematic persecution of civil rights dissidents in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On Remembrance Day 1978 a small section of the Australian community but an influential section of the Australian community not only chose to forget those who are fighting for basic human rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, but they callously turned their backs on those freedom fighters in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, the modernday martyrs of 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a day of shame for Australia when one of the two major political parties in the State of Victoria came out publicly and refused to condemn the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> for its treatment of civil rights dissidents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have asked questions of the Minister particularly in relation to the Finnish Agreement and the fact that uranium will be enriched in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>- asking about safeguards procedures for toll enrichment- and we are not getting any assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not much point in attacking the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> on the basis of having bugging devices here as though it is a pleasant exercise and in the same context not telling anything about nuclear safeguards arrangements with that country from the point of view of uranium supplied to Finland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the EEC suspended export subsidies or restitutions on butter sales pending an inquiry into an attempted sale of French butter to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> contrary to the notification procedure introduced after a similar sale in 1 977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-58-98">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be noted, I think, that the ANZUS treaty was emphasised in a very particular way last year because even though discussions were going on between the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and the United States about lowering force levels in the Indian Ocean- I have indicated that I hope those discussions can be resumed- a major ANZUS exercise involving significant United States and Australian forces took place off the coast of Western Australia in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has that not pushed the Vietnamese into the arms of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government has failed to maintain a balance in relations with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> on the one hand and China on the other hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has made a strong effort to isolate Vietnam and it has helped to drive it straight towards the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ability of the Vietnam Government to absorb those problems is limited by the lack of assistance it received from other countries except of course the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and some socialist countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have some evidence of the sharpening of the differences within the Vietnamese leadership as the links with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> are bound tighter and tighter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The conflicts reflect and were created by the hostility and rivalry existing among four states: The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, China, Vietnam and Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise this deliberate and substantial militarisation of African conflict by outside states- particularly the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and its Cuban surrogates- because I do not think that the qualitative change it has wrought in African affairs has registered clearly enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation began to deteriorate last year with increasing hostilities between Kampuchea and Vietnam, a worsening relationship between China and Vietnam and the signing of a Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation- which included a military assistance clause- between the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Vietnamese attack on Kampuchea was an attack by a client of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> on a client of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever its motivation the attack bore directly on the rivalry and competition between the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and China for long term influence in the region- and, more generally, on the whole Sino-Soviet dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>China’s subsequent incursion into Vietnam can only be understood as a reaction to Vietnam’s treaty with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, its invasion of Kampuchea and the installation there of a pro- Vietnamese Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In turn, its concern about events in Kampuchea relate not only to the extension of Vietnamese influence but also to the role of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> as Vietnam’s principal -backer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have called on Vietnam to withdraw its forces from Kampuchea, on China to withdraw its forces from Vietnam and on the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> to exercise restraint to prevent the last turn of the screw, which could be disastrous not merely for the region but for the peace of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a neighbour of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, a major oil producer and a principal member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is increasing its already enormous military power faster than any other country, and while it is increasingly active in relation to the trouble spots of the world, politically it is the odd-man-out among the great powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the time of the Korean War, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> was pleased to see China at war and can welcome now in its own terms the dissipation of China’s energy in the south. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> need not lift a finger in the sense that it may well hope that China’s influence could fail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> was delighted when China was embroiled in Korea in the 1950s and those qualities of spreading the interest and flexibility which so characterise Soviet policy are likely to be satisfied to see China at war with Vietnam and China’s relations with Vietnam being shattered for a generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The central elements of his arguments in relation to these various international elements can be linked with a decline in the power of the United States and the increase in the power of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whilst all of us wish for nothing more than peace between nations regardless of differences of ideological approach, the reality facing us today is that we have seen, over the last few years in particular, a steady but sure increase in the military capacity of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> compared with the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is so easy to imagine a situation where one mistake, one miscalculation, one rifle bullet across an international frontier, could well be enough to launch the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> against China- an action which would result, quite likely, in disastrous consequences for all of mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our world today is a relatively small place and nations have the capacity, in the form of intercontinental ballistic missiles and manned bombers, to travel great distances, for example from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> to Australia, or from the United States to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>- in fact virtually around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite this enormous military build-up by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> in recent years, it must be recognised that since 1945 no Soviet unit has been placed in a military position against any other state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation area of Western Europe there is again a degree of malaise in that the United States and its Western allies demonstrably do not have at this point of time at least equality of strategic capability with the Warsaw Pact countries, which include the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Cuban forces, armed and equipped by the Soviet, have again been prepared to be the catspaw of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, dabbling wherever possible in strife between states, in civil wars between rulers and people and between rulers and their own elite as in Chad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, we are seeing a pronounced deterioration in the relative strength of the United States and its allies visavis the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and its allies, a pronounced deterioration in the capacity of the Western alliance to present a united face, and a deterioration in the capacity of the Third World to feel that in the West it has a group of states which are reliable, can be depended upon to make decisions and have the courage to carry them out for the welfare of mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We commend the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> for its moderation in response to the Chinese actions, but it is to be regretted that the same moderating influence was not extended from Moscow in the case of Vietnam’s actions against Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Co-operation with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> serves the cause of peace, for in the nuclear age world peace must include peace betweeen the superpowers- and it must mean the control of nuclear arms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>President Carter went on to say that SALT II will not be based on sentiment, but on the self interest of the United States and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our relationship with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is a mixture of cooperation and competition, and as President of the United States, I have no more difficult task than to balance the two. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in our national interest to pursue it even as we continue competition with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> elsewhere in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She has her own reasons for trying to marshal powerful forces against the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Frankly, it would suit China to see the United States with overwhelming weapons superiority over the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, in fact, the United States is prepared in SALT II to accept numerical equality of nuclear weapons with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If anyone were to suggest that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is not involved in any way in this matter and is just an innocent bystander wanting to assist wherever possible, he would be very naive indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one were to read the statements made by the foreign ministers of other great nations one would realise that there has been an obvious attempt in each case to try to appreciate a situation which involves the possibility of an unthinkable conflict, that is, the possibility of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and China coming into conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Foreign Minister has made this statement at a time when continuous attempts are being made by the United States to achieve a genuine detente with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not suggesting for one moment that they gave me classified information, but the general impression there is that America is getting nearer to a genuine understanding- and this is being achieved in a remarkable way- with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> at the same time as this very wonderful association is being built up with communist China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As people who have talked about the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> have said, we are dealing not with the dictatorship of the proletariat but with the dictatorship of the secretariat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a dictatorship in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and there is a dictatorship in many other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some cases the difference may be only marginal such as in the disputes between the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and China or between Chile and Argentina. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raised the point that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> indicated to this country last year that it would invite a parliamentary delegation to visit that country only on the basis that no members of the Joint Foreign Affairs and Defence Sub-committee on Human Rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> would be on that delegation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government to its eternal shame agreed to send to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> a delegation on the basis that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> had decided that certain persons in this Parliament were persona non grata. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, there would be no point in Australia deciding to boycott the Olympic Games to be held in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Olympic Games would be held in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> even if Australia decided not to participate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> would be able to say that a campaign was being conducted by countries opposed to the holding of the Games there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would only be to the advantage of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to make this point in relation to the conflict in South East Asia: It is utter hypocrisy for the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> to criticise China or the United States for interfering in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has occupied- in some cases continually- nearly all of Eastern Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some cases- for example, the Baltic States- it has actually incorporated the countries into the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With its Cuban mercenaries fighting in much of Africa, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has a hide to talk about interference in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would imagine that if a direct request were made and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> attacked China in any force, the Chinese would neutralise their southern flank with a much, much heavier blow being directed at Vietnam than at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that it is not in Vietnam’s interest to call in aid from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the world scene, it is perfectly clear that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is seeking to obtain strategic dominance throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1985 the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> will have a strategic superiority over the United States of America that will be very, very pronounced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, at about that time there will be a predominance by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, which has shown itself willing to use client states to the utmost to achieve its strategic aims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That aim has been announced by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the honourable member for Dawson  (Mr Braithwaite)  and I paid a state visit to China in July 1978, we were both struck- and this is a highly bipartisan comment- by the widespread fear, which was expressed everywhere we went, about the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In China at the moment there is enormous fear of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been to China on two occasions in the last four years and I have been to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chinese are fearful of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> detests the Chinese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and certainly Vietnam and Cambodia should be present as should some of the other great countries of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is the only country in the world that can endanger world peace and the only country that has both the will and the ability to create a world diversion and involve the rest of the world in possible nuclear assault of one kind or another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember my last visit to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> when all the Russians talked about was war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as the United States of America and the rest of the world want the SALT II negotiations to be completed soon I have no doubt that so too does the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> knows that it could not do more than possibly take out Singkiang Province and destroy the oil reserves and oil operations in Taching. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one goes to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and talks to the people- they cannot talk very much to you- one finds that the people in Leningrad and Moscow are people of energy, physical strength, and effervescence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> cannot go on permanently appropriating so much of its real wealth not to the purposes of humanity and its consumers throughout the whole of the Union, but in order to sustain the greatest army, navy and air force of all time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could not be confident but many of the great world leaders such as the Chancellor of West Germany and others, have expressed their belief that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> will act with restraint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>seen alongside negotiations of the United States .and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> on the strategic arms limitations talks, the Camp David negotiations which have just resumed in regard to the Middle East, the situation in Indo-China and the African position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States-Peking recognition, this new United States-Sino link, is in its own way one counter to the strategic balance which has moved in favour of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is the discussions on the stabilisation of forces in the Indian Ocean that were taking place between the United States and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So talks, although currently stalled, are being held between the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and the United States on the stabilisation of naval forces in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should also be very thankful at this point in time for the restraint displayed by the USSR because when China invaded Vietnam everyone was concerned that there could be immediate intervention by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is to say, there would be a non-aligned communist country- a country not aligned with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> or with China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did Australia work with the United States to force Vietnam into COMECON-the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance- and into a close dependence on the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> against Vietnam’s wishes against its independence and against its integration into the region? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its search, Vietnam was struggling to avoid being locked into economic dependence on the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Vietnam was attempting to free itself from the powerless, triangular balancing between China and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs almost excuses the Chinese invasion of Vietnam as part of its containment strategy against the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also dismisses the incursion by Vietnam into Kampuchea as the act of a client of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> against Kampuchea as a client of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At least the Vietnamese do not make Cam Ranh Bay available to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the past two or three weeks the whole world has held up its hands in horror at a possible confrontation between two giant nations, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and the People’s Republic of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On all fronts we have seen the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> take the initiative: In IndoChina with the Vietnamese in Kampuchea, with the Cubans, in Africa and in Iran where the leftist forces helped set the stage for the toppling of the pro-Western Shah. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have already witnessed in Angola the takeover of a Soviet orientated government with the assistance of would be Cuban mercenaries armed and supplied by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> spreading its influence in Asia, Chinese intervention was inevitable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not that the People’s Republic of China was prompted by territorial ambitions in Vietnam, but they wished, probably naturally enough, to make sure that they were not outflanked by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> in Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall the situation in Indo-China seems to indicate that here is another explosive situation, sparked by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, which has caught Jimmy Carter once again with his pants down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot has been said in the last two or three days about who sent the Cuban troops, and the relationship of  President  Castro and  Mr Brezhnev  of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we give the central place to the traditional issues of power politics we may be led to forget that the threat to the peace of the world and to the security of this country derives much more fundamentally from the gap between the rich nations and the poor, between the developed and the developing nations than it does from the global ambitions of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> or the paranoia of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It leads one, I think, to particularly unbalanced analyses and one of these is the role of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> as portrayed in his comments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not mean that Vietnam will not use the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> or that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> will not use Vietnam each in its own interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interestingly enough, in nearly every case members of that party were blinded by their obsession with the threat of atheistic communism or with geo-political visions about the threat of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Above all, we should not exaggerate the global menace of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> to the extent that it blinds us to the local realities of Iran, Indo-China and Southern Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> ‘is the odd man out among the great powers’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> occupies both a dangerous and a difficult position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the triangular balance of power between China, the United States and the Soviet Unionone could also include Western Europe- the odd man out at the moment is the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister noted, I think quite rightly, that there is a dangerous asymmetry between the military strength of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and its diplomatic isolation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Arab States- we ought to remember this point- produce 60 per cent of OPEC oil and 39 per cent of the world’s oil supply, excluding the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> or, if one likes, the communist bloc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Algeria, Iraq- Iraq seems to be getting out of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> orbit- Kuwait, Qatar and the Emirates are closely tied in influence to Saudi Arabia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are Mexico, Norway, Britain, the United States, Canada and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Vietnamese attack on Kampuchea was an attack by a client of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> ona client of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned because of the increasing influence of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> in the South East Asian area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was it to sit still and, to use the Minister’s words, let this client of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> actually jeopardise its territorial boundaries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remark was significant, because it was generally assumed that Indonesia was as suspicious of Vietnam’s intentions in the region of its ASEAN partners, particularly given its links with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, enhanced by the Moscow-Hanoi friendship treaty signed soon after Vietnamese Premier Pham Van Dong’s goodwill tour around all the ASEAN countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind  Dr Mochtar  that Australia says that Vietnam is the client of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But one member of ASEAN is leaning towards the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I express the gravest concern that a client of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> engaged in military aggression, precipitated this crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not apprehend any fear for Australia should Indonesia come under the influence of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if Indonesia had been more under the influence of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> than it was probably there would have been little likelihood of Indonesia doing what she did to little Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>opposes the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> instead of uniting with it, opposes the People’s democracies instead of uniting with them, opposes the Communists, the proletariat and the People’s forces in all countries instead of uniting with them, opposes the national liberation movements, instead of uniting with them and all the oppressed nations  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Washington, Friday- ASEAN leaders urged yesterday an increased US economic presence in the region to counter the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is utter hypocrisy for the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> to criticise China or the United States for interfering in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has occupied- in some cases continuallynearly all of Eastern Europe . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general purport of what the Opposition has been saying is that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> could be made to feel the odd man out if we do not take an even-handed posture in this international situation; the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> could feel bad about things and this would make the situation very difficult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of all the super powers I believe that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is the only one which is building up an offensive capacity well beyond its needs for defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am talking about the extreme interventions of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there is an increasing concern about the balance of power as we move into the 1980s and about the activities of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two principal situations that the Minister discussed, both of which are described as being geo-politically critical, are set out in terms of the imperialistic ambitions of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, in the South East Asian situation, where currently there exist conflicts between Kampuchea and Vietnam and between Vietnam and China, we are told simplistically, if impressively, that the conflicts reflect and were created by the hostility and rivalry existing among four States- the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, China, Vietnam and Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Minister’s terms, it was clearly in the United States’ geo-political interests, after the conclusion of that notorious and infamous war in Vietnam and Cambodia, to provide massive resources to rebuild Vietnam on the basis that that would be the only way to lessen the dependence of that country on either the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> or China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result is that Vietnam has been drawn into a struggle between China and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> in which her own national interests ought not to be at stake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Minister has admitted that the Shah’s regime collapsed through internal causes, nevertheless the dreaded Marxist influences are at work in the region, which he asserts is of great strategic importance to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It involved itself in that way and, as one of the consequences of that involvement, Vietnam has been drawn into what might be described, in the Minister’s terms, as a geo-political conflict between the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to place on record my personal thanks to the officials in the embassies of China, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, the United States and France from whom I sought advice during the recent conflict in South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At one time one might have said that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> possessed an overwhelming armed force in its conventional troops and the United States possessed an overwhelming capacity to move by sea, that one was a sea power and the other a land power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who has read the recent strategic studies will appreciate that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has now moved into a state of parity with the United States in both offensive and defensive weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it is absolutely correct, given the damage that can be done by missiles in the event of a misunderstanding, that the United States and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> should make the SALT agreement their priority above everything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> had to do, quite succinctly, was to stand by and wait for the effect of these mistakes in international affairs to manifest itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They thought that when Vietnam signed the agreement with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> Vietnam took advantage of the agreement and immediately went into Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However I am not too certain that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> would have encouraged Vietnam to do anything of the sort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficulty is to get a rule of law which will be acceptable to the antagonists; to get some sort of world authority, world court, world police or world legislature which both the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and the United States of America will recognise as being sufficiently impartial to warrant them surrendering that much of their national sovereignty that they will accept a decision, a compromise, short of an armed solution, which nowadays is no solution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One gets this answer from Britain, the United States and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My second point is that the dispute amongst the totalitarian gangsters- the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, China and Vietnam- proves what I have always thought about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the drum beats in Asia and the murderous antics of the gang of three- the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, China and Vietnam- are heard and noted by every Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In part, the lack of Western support forced the Vietnamese Government to adopt more orthodox Soviet style communist policies and to lean increasingly upon the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> for support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be pointed out that if we have learned anything from the history of Vietnam it is that Russians and Vietnamese interests do no perfectly coincide and that the fiercefully nationalistic Vietnamese are not likely to become simply puppets of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is false strategy at this time to engage in positions based upon moral and pontifical statements which are designed essentially to alienate Hanoi, because the effect of any strategy of isolation is to drive Hanoi further into the arms of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who has been to China knows that throughout China, at almost every level and on almost every street there is concern and fear about an attack by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally, one can understand that China will be, and obviously is, concerned when it sees that in the communist world the Vietnamese are operating in an increasingly closer alliance with, and with an increasing dependence upon, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He mentioned that South East Asia is again the scene of armed conflict created by the hostility and rivalry existing amongst four states- the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, China, Vietnam and Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is interested, and so are we. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He talked about the Vietnamese attack on Kampuchea as an attack by a client of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> on a client of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever its motivation the attack bore directly on the rivalry and competition between the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and China . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In turn, its concern about events in Kampuchea relate not only to the extension of Vietnamese influence but also to the role of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> as Vietnam’s principal backer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accepting the Minister’s assumptions, what he is saying is that Vietnam has behaved in the way it has because it is beholden to and dependent upon the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It sought aid where it could and that aid came from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why has it encouraged Vietnam, in its conflict with China, to seek refuge in the arms of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The events in Vietnam and Kampuchea are largely the continuation of a long historical struggle between the two countries and it is highly unlikely that any other country including China and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> will become involved directly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be sure, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has the capability to attempt the invasion of virtually any country in the world, as for that matter does the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one were allowed flights into fancy sufficient to conjure up a world in which no-one else existed but the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and one other country, it would require no brilliant insight to demonstrate that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> possesses overwhelming conventional military power visavis any one of a hundred or more potential victims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is also true that it is unlikely that either the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> or the United States would engage in any military venture against Australia in isolation and, I would hope, not in combination with any other group of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-33-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If such place happens to be within the present boundaries of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and the passport is presented to a Soviet authority abroad, or at a place which is governed by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, the authority may treat the person as a Soviet citizen for all purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they go back to Yugoslavia or back to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> they are treated as nationals of those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be of concern not only to Australia but also to other countries in the Asian-Pacific region and would be a further indication of the increased reliance of Vietnam on the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is that most of the uranium used by Western Europe is enriched in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, so I am sick to death of all the talk about a red bogy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The uranium used by countries which honourable members opposite regard as allies and with which they want us to trade could be enriched in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as United States-Soviet presence in the Indian Ocean is concerned, it is well known that in recent years the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has had more ships, up to approximately 20 at any one time of which nearly half have been combatants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This general pattern was broken at the beginning of 1978 when the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, in response to its growing involvement in the Horn of Africa, particularly in Ethiopia, significantly increased its naval deployment in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response the United States broke off talks with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> which were aimed at stabilising their naval presence in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia, of course, is on record as welcoming the talks on the United States-<span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> Arms Limitation Agreement in the Indian Ocean which, as I mentioned earlier, were suspended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be recalled in the latter connection that in 1977 I received a firm and unequivocal assurance from the United States Secretary of State that nothing entered into between the United States and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> would qualify the operation of ANZUS. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, it needs to be recognised that a prerequisite for any agreement, such as talks between the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and the United States that might be resumed, would be a degree of political stability in the region which is not there at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, one has to ask whether we could remove from Vietnam and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> the incentive to mount another bloody offensive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is also interesting to note that a considerable amount of Australian wheat is getting into Kampuchea via the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At present, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> provides about $2m of military aid to Vietnam each day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The delivery of wheat to Vietnam from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>- wheat that has been purchased in Australia- is something that we should keep under review; but it is hoped that the supplies are going to the people concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and the United States have the capacity for the air transportation of huge amounts of equipment, material and other aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> bears a heavy degree of moral responsibility for the recent invasion by Vietnam and that country is supplying food as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> introduced fairly all-embracing laws regarding its citizenship and the ramifications of these laws should be responded to, I believe, with the best of legal advice available, both at private international law and public international law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, between 1956 and 1958 the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> concluded bilateral agreements with Yugoslavia, Hungary, Romania, Albania, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, North Korea, Poland and Mongolia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike the Conventions concluded between the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and Eastern European countries, which require only that a person seek the consent of the State in which he is not resident but whose nationality he wishes to retain, Chapter II of the Council of Europe Convention requires that a person seek the consent of the State whose nationality he wishes to renounce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may have a good deal more in common with the system of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would have to go to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> or China to see a comparable concentration of media control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee gave extensive consideration to the text ban question, but work on the drafting of a treaty awaits the conclusion of the discussions now under way among the United States, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> presented to the Committee a draft convention banning- radiological weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> at that stage did not seem to have enough allies to enable Australia to get a place on the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister notes that this prospective treaty is currently the subject of negotiations between the two super-powers, namely, the United States and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is true, but even more to the point is that the achievement of a comprehensive test ban is dependent in the first instance on the conclusion of a new Strategic Arms Limitation Talks agreement between the United States and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, without agreement on SALT II there is little prospect of the United States and the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> agreeing on any other arms control matter in the next few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, unless the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and the United States agree on limitations to their own armaments, there is nil prospect of critically important countries, such as India, Pakistan, Brazil, Argentina and South Africa, agreeing to a comprehensive test ban. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I point out in passing that the leading officials of the Building Workers Industrial Union have a very close association with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and strongly support the policies that that country pursues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On behalf of the Joint Committee on Foreign AfFairs and Defence I present the Committee’s report on Human Rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, together with the transcript of evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-by leave-The report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence entitled ‘Human Rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>’ is based on the evidence given to a sub-committee of the Joint Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many witnesses had extensive experience in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has failed to enter into the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and has failed to implement many of its formal commitments in such documents as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Final Act of the 1975 Helsinki Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within three years of  Mr Brezhnev  signing the Final Act of the Helsinki Agreement, the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> flouted the Agreement’s human rights provisions to such an extent that it has even imprisoned or expelled most of the people who, with considerable courage, had openly monitored the extent of Soviet compliance with the Helsinki Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Soviet citizens may not engage in independent political activity, nor form or belong to political parties other than the Communist Party of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>; nor do the Soviet people have an opportunity to effect a change in their government or parliaments through the ballot box. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is unique among the major powers in that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>’s dominant nationality is portentially outnumbered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The democratic movement in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has received some severe setbacks in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many leading activists are now imprisoned for long terms, exiled to remote parts of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> or expelled abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is systematically abusing psychiatry through the forced internment of mentally healthy people in order to cure them of their political or religious beliefs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This also enables the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> to avoid the presence of some important dissidents at trials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Similarly this can be done by individual Australians during cultural, academic and scientific exchanges with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the evidence before the Sub-Committee on Human Rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> was to a great extent unfavourable to the Soviet Government, the Committee regrets that the Soviet Embassy in Australia did not avail itself of ample formal or informal opportunities to put a Soviet viewpoint to the Sub-Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-by leave-As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence but not a member of the Sub-Committee on Human Rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> I think it is important that the House take note of the fact that a number of dissenting reports have been published as well as the report which has just been tabled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Before the suspension of the sitting I was speaking to the report on human rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> which has been presented today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My concern is that in undertaking an inquiry of the magnitude of this report into human rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> no funds- I repeat, no funds- were made available for the Committee to enable it to ensure it had available to it those witnesses whom it sought in order to carry out its inquiries or inspections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, an invitation was extended to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> to give evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that anyone of intelligence in this House would expect the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> to appear before a jury in Australia to give evidence on its own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is not obliged to appear before such an inquiry and Australia is not obliged either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is a restrictive and repressive regime as are those regimes throughout the world which are totalitarian in character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Such regimes are not limited to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> but many do not profess to be libertarian or democratic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Human rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> bearing in mind Australia’s support for the principles contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the final act of the Helsinki Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The human rights movement throughout the world was responsible for the ultimate release by the Soviet authorities of Leonid Plyushch and the permission which was granted to him to leave the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be clear to any reader of the transcript of the public evidence which is available, or from this report, that witnesses were called to give their evidence because of expertise on the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and its application of human rights, and not for their political allegiance or philosophy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one examined the documents from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>- for example, the Soviet Constitutions of 1936 and 1977, the Helsinki Accords, the criminal code or the law on religious associations, and then took the evidence of former citizens of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> who suffered as a result of action by Soviet authorities pursuant to Soviet law, the Committee’s conclusions are found to be soundly based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place, I refer to the program of Russification adopted by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the political climate of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> does not change, then the consequence is likely to be the dilution of our nation in the sea of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Anti-semitic practices adopted in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> are summarised in Chapter 5 of the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1975 the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> signed the final act of the Helsinki Agreement, which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is part of the Helsinki accords which were signed by the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> four years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee received evidence, for example, that such literature is published outside the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and we had one case referred to us where an action was taken against the Soviet officials in the USSR Embassy in France to stop the dissemination of anti-semitic literature in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this particular matter the Committee recommends in paragraph 26 of the conclusions and recommendations that our Government should press the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> to cease the circulation of any anti-semitic literature in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee found it difficult to understand Soviet thinking because there are many citizens of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> who practise the Jewish faith who are anxious to remain as citizens of that State and who wish to continue with Jewish cultural activities within the USSR. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by considering one matter which the Committee was careful to determine early in its deliberations and that is the question whether an investigation by a parliamentary committee into human rights in the USSR would have an adverse affect in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> on those people whom the Committee was anxious to support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost without exception witness after witness confirmed that the Committee’s actual hearing, let alone its final report and recommendation, was of considerable assistance to those within the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> who were seeking to establish human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the course of his examination, I asked whether protests by lawyers or legal institutions in Australia would have any influence on the denial of due process of law in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When Professor Telford Taylor has criticised the proceedings that have been conducted in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, and particularly in many of the Jewish dissident cases, I think it is important, although they deny that it makes any impact upon them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He referred in particular to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> being a super power which, because of the enunciation of the rights of Soviet citizens in the Constitution, wants the world to believe that those rights are enjoyed by every citizen in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Chairman  would also say that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is an ‘evangelising super power’ seeking to persuade people outside the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> that the USSR model is one which should be followed in other nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be also my wish that every member of the Red Army Russian Song and Dance Company, presently touring Australia, could return to their homeland with a copy of the human rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> report made to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This report should be compulsory reading for every visitor, sportsman and woman and official who will visit the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> for the 1980 Moscow Olympics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This report should be read by all people interested in the freedom of the individual and by those who seek to understand how society operates in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a member of the Sub-Committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence which prepared the report on human rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, I would like to make a few points. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has only one political party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why the present position in respect of human rights exists in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, as illustrated in this report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make one point in relation to human rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and in relation to the nationality question: I do not necessarily support nationalistic claims, whether they be by people who originated in the Baltic States or in the Ukraine, those of Jews and so on and tend to oppose nationalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it is important to have democratic freedom in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what is happening at the present time is that they can neither change the setup inside the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> nor leave the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to make a couple of points about human rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that those of us who have been interested in the question of freedom and the question of human rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and in other countries know- the report emphasises it in its first conclusions- that there have been positive changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, changes have occurred in some ways away from the extreme totalitarian state of what was generally considered to be a Stalinist society in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> until the death of Stalin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is still important to know what is happening in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has a very intelligent approach to what is happening in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was certainly a pleasant change from the usual content of  Broadband  programs on the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and its satellites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that it will stimulate discussion on the question of civil liberties not only in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> but in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Following on from what was said by the previous  speaker,  the honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman),  I have never asked for a visa to visit the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, or any country associated with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, either in Europe or in Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee has aimed in its report on Human Rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> to present an objective, factual body of material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From this information the Committee has drawn a number of conclusions which to a large extent are based on the testimony of witnesses whom the SubCommittee on Human Rights had sought due to their personal experience in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other speakers have outlined the justification for the production of the report on human rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and some of its findings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A major area in which the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> represses human rights concerns ethnic minorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As emphasised in the report there is State interference in almost all religious activity in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> will need to pay great attention to the aspirations of its large Muslim communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further example of repression of human rights is the restriction on a citizen’s intention to permanently move to another part of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been some successful campaigns outside the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> to secure the release or emigration of imprisoned Soviet intellectuals and dissidents, or on behalf of those threatened with imprisonment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most notable international efforts to counter human rights violations in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has been the campaign against Soviet abuse of psychiatry for political purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report makes several recommendations on what the West can do to secure improved human rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As long as the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> seeks goodwill and economic concessions from the West, there seems to be scope for the West to achieve a more humane Soviet attitude towards its own people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia should insist that a regard for human rights be part of Australia’s relationship with the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> sometimes claims a lack of understanding in the West of its case on human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee has recommended that the Australian Government suggest to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> that it may be possible to arrange a reciprocal exchange of views in the Soviet and Australian newspapers and in other publications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That may seem to some to be an unrealistic suggestion and I doubt that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> will take it up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, it is recommended that Australia seek the right to distribute informative publications in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, in the same way that the USSR is allowed to distribute in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> of course is not the only offender regarding the violation of human rights; there are some other nations where attention needs to be directed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the substance of this particular report is directed to the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and therefore that is where the original charge lies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would reiterate our view that based on the substantial evidence available the civil rights of certain groups,  especially minorities, in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> are seriously infringed and fall below that which should be expected in any civilised society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those reasons, whilst I accept completely that there are infringements of civil rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, I am one of those who feel that the recommendation in paragraph 65 and the original reference of the matter to the SubCommittee can do untold harm to Australia in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As a member of the Sub-Committee on Human Rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, which undertook this inquiry, I want to speak for a few moments on this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are concerned here with civil rights not only in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> but also throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall read part of the Reservations that was expressed because we did not hear evidence from the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is realised that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> was asked to provide contrary evidence and refused to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, the important aspect of this document is that a group of members from both sides of this Parliament was given the responsibility to look into human rights in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am depressed that suspicion of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> has increased over the last few years, and likewise <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> suspicion of the rest of the world, particularly the West, has also increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, one would have to be blind to not recognise that inside the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> there are great deprivations of human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, why pick the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has to say that the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> is powerful, influential and stable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having been there, I can say quite emphatically that one feels safe and secure wherever one travels in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> now has some of the problems of the rest of the world in regard to these matters but, it does have freedoms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as one can tell, the people of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> are free of the real poverty that inflicts a great number of other societies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is obviously not the case in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chilean Government, which I think would be much worse than that of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, permitted the inquiry to go ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This compares with 83,000 million tonnes in the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and 1 14,000 million tonnes in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the potential that the situation there may lead to further conflict between China and Vietnam, which in turn could possibly involve the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The potential influence of the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span>, using its surrogate, Cuba, for disruption in the internal affairs of Africa, has caused considerable concern both on the continent and elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>The Government took the view that the situation then existing in southern Africa was morally wrong, and we believed that it would only enhance the interests and activities of hostile outside nations, including the <span class="highlight">Soviet Union</span> and its supporters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></li>
