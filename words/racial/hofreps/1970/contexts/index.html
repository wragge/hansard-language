    <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs will know that petitions are circulating in New Zealand calling on the government of New Zealand to act against Australian discrimination against New Zealand citizens of non-European and nonMaori <span class="highlight">racial</span> origin and that yesterday notice was given in the New Zealand Parliament of a question critical of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: What protests and representations has the Government received from the New Zealand Government regarding the continuing discrimination against New Zealand citizens of non-European and non-Maori <span class="highlight">racial</span> origin in entry requirements by Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are <span class="highlight">racial</span> tensions - ethnic tensions - which go back for a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer him to a number of resolutions adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 14 December 1972, dealing with decolonisation and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, which Australia supported and voted for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:  (1), (2), (5) and (6) The Government, since 2 December 1972, has not made available any funds to religious or other agencies, such as the United Nations, for the specific purpose of combatting <span class="highlight">racial</span> discriminition in foreign countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-59-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Australian Government declined to receive information from South African naval intelligence because of the <span class="highlight">racial</span> policies of South Africa? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Applicants for exploration licences in the Northern Territory are not required to state their <span class="highlight">racial</span> origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not take up the time of the Committee for any period, because I know the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  wants to get on to the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Existing sub-clause (3) provides that Part II of the Act which prohibits <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, shall not apply to distinctions, exclusions, restrictions or preferences between Australian citizens and persons who are not Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government opposes <span class="highlight">racial</span> policies wherever they may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I can say that in accordance with Queensland ‘s policy, Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders would be viewed no differently from any other Queenslander regardless of <span class="highlight">racial</span> ancestry’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-47-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I told the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting on several occasions that the Australian Government considered <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and apartheid to be an offence to human dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-27-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Pursuant to section 46 of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975 I present the annual report of the Commissioner for Community Relations for the year ended 30 June 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Pursuant to section 46 of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975 I present the annual report of the Commissioner for Community Relations for the year ended 30 June 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The records of the Australian Electoral Office do not distinguish the <span class="highlight">racial</span> origins of persons claiming enrolment; therefore it is not possible to determine which electors are Aboriginal and thereby calculate the statistics sought by the honourable member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-51-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the 1976 Census, 36,638 persons describing themselves as of Chinese <span class="highlight">racial</span> origin were resident in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised by the Australian Statistician that tabulations of 1976 Census data as currently planned up to September 1979 do not provide information on the numbers of persons of Chinese <span class="highlight">racial</span> origin in individual electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-43-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Pursuant to section 46 of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975 I present the report of the Commissioner for Community Relations 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, should the Commissioner for Community Relations investigate this matter to ensure that there is no discrimination on <span class="highlight">racial</span> grounds? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Has the Commissioner for Community Relations who is a statutory officer appointed under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975, received financial assistance, either direct or indirect, by way of air fares and accommodation from any organisation or person to enable him to travel (a) within Australia or (b) overseas, in the performance of his duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These resolutions do not contravene the Commonwealth’s anti-discrimination legislation (the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-73-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today the world seethes with <span class="highlight">racial</span> unrest - in the United States, in parts of South East Asia, in sections of communities all over the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There remain only two States in the world where <span class="highlight">racial</span> superiority has been raised to a fine legislative art. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While 1 concede that all members on the other side do not sympathise with the attitude of this particular group - and I commend the honourable member for Bradfield  (Mr Turner)  for his question to the Prime Minister on Tuesday - it seems to me that there is an attitude of <span class="highlight">racial</span> superiority prevalent amongst some honourable members on the other side that is demonstrated in the Government policies toward South East Asia - in particular Vietnam - towards New Guinea with its paternalistic colonialism, its immigration policy and its inability to carry out a concerted attack on the question of Aboriginal advancement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is no evidence that the Mataungan Association is against anything except the Multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span> Council’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He found as follows:  (i have) the very heavy duty of publicly announcing that it is my considered opinion that the Mufti-<span class="highlight">racial</span> Council elections of early 1969 should have been cancelled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation in the Gazelle represents a fundamental breakdown in <span class="highlight">racial</span> partnership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They range from the aged and needy in our great cities to the hungry people of India; from the orphans in Vietnam to the victims of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked whether his attention had been drawn to attacks made by the Leader of the Opposition on the integrity of the courts in New Guinea and alleged <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this moment the Leader of the Opposition rose to his feet and burst in, saying that the matters which I purported to state could not be authenticated, namely, that he had made attacks on the integrity of the courts and alleged <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the  Speaker  asked me whether I could vouch for the accuracy of the report; I take it, as I had mentioned no report, he meant the report of an attack on the integrity of the courts in New Guinea alleging <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So let us look closely, for instance, at the honourable member for Fremantle’s description, as a lie, of the charge that I had just made and which I swear to this House to be accurately based, namely, that the Leader of the Opposition had carried out an attack on the integrity of the courts in New Guinea by alleging <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was it legitimate criticism, this condemnation of this court for deciding questions on a <span class="highlight">racial</span> (or other non-judicial) basis? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me quote the Leader of the Opposition’s words describing how he carried out what is an undeniable attack on the integrity of the courts by alleging <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any situation, let alone one where <span class="highlight">racial</span> tension has been inflamed to fever pitch by extremists, those words are a grave attack on the integrity of the courts on the basis of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last Thursday the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  added his voice spontaneously to the charges of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in the courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was a meeting of people with a reactionary programme running counter to specific recommendations of the United Nations Trusteeship Council, to the determinations of their own House of Assembly and the popularly elected council, the multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span> council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And there is another way, the way of democratic and constructive method, of reason, education and responsibility, of the encouragement of <span class="highlight">racial</span>, inter-<span class="highlight">racial</span> and multiracial co-operation and of the denial of violence and force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The immigration policy for Papua and New Guinea was a long standing one based on the need to avoid the sort of problem which has arisen in other developing countries over the admission of alien <span class="highlight">racial</span> groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that Australia has the right to flood Papua and New Guinea with alien <span class="highlight">racial</span> groups, but it is astonishing when it is applied to the appointment of two lecturers, or rather to the renewal of the appointment of one lecturer and the appointment of another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never known of any <span class="highlight">racial</span> problem anywhere on the face of the earth that was caused by appointments to universities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a number of <span class="highlight">racial</span> problems in emerging countries around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Look at all the more important, wide ranging matters concerning New Guinea; the fees for high schools put up this year; the wages - the lowest, it appears, in the Pacific or the Indian Ocean areas, 40% at the highest of those which are paid to Australians in the same job; and the decline of workers associations, in a country where nearly every employer is an Australian and nearly every employee a New Guinean, where accordingly every industrial dispute becomes a <span class="highlight">racial</span> dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further discussions took place this month with the States on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination at the Standing Committee of Commonwealth and State Officers on Aboriginal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-51-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister for External Affairs aware that the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations, instructed by the General Assembly, has addressed letters to all member states requesting them to participate in activities for 1971 which the United Nations has designated International Year for Action to Combat Racism and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that in the recent General Assembly there was a resolution by the United Nations on co-operation to avoid <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The foreign affairs decisions, even the commitment of troops, have depended on internal political considerations of the most cynical kind Fundamentally, the Liberal appeal is to fear, and one of its ingredients is <span class="highlight">racial</span> fear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The average Australian man in the street, when asked what he thinks about South Africa, would probably say he had a vague idea that apartheid in South Africa meant that the blacks were not paid quite as well as the whites, that they had to use separate public facilities and that they could not play in multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span> sporting teams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The label on the package is ‘Apartheid’, meaning separate development, but the contents and the reality are <span class="highlight">racial</span> dicrimination, exploitation and degradation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The essence of government policy is the separation of the people of different <span class="highlight">racial</span> origins and the elimination, as far as possible, of contact between them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The distinctive features of the patterns of unrest could be characterised as, firstly, the influence of communications media in creating a generation consciousness; secondly, a crisis of legitimacy and a breakdown in the authority of any institution with which the youth generation disagreed; and thirdly, <span class="highlight">racial</span> injustices and poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At least in Australia the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth),  who is at the table, is doing his best to reverse the tendency of majority rule to cause <span class="highlight">racial</span> suppression in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important for Australia’s future that we work towards minimising race consciousness and avoid steps which tend to emphasise divisions on a <span class="highlight">racial</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to make it clear that there are no <span class="highlight">racial</span> aspects in this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If his insulting attacks upon countries such as South Africa mean <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, and if his foreign policy will be to insult countries in which he believes <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination exists, he will suddenly run out of countries and he will be able to dispense altogether with the Department of External Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the United States there were race riots at Watts and Newark, <span class="highlight">racial</span> murders, the burning of towns and portions of towns, massive civil disobedience and’ civil rights riots in Chicago at the Democratic Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700922_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a country that has many social, <span class="highlight">racial</span> and economic problems, they have had a common standard and a common set of values to which these problems could be referred and against which they could be solved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in many respects we have adopted what might be called an ‘attitude of unconscious <span class="highlight">racial</span> superiority’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But our restricted immigration policy is not based on any theory of <span class="highlight">racial</span> superiority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s immigration policy is directed to maintaining a predominantly homogeneous population, mainly because we would not like to see Australia become the breeding ground of <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice and hatred such as we are witnessing in America and England today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we can adapt our resources to bringing in people who are readily able to be assimilated, then we may well avoid the problems of <span class="highlight">racial</span> hatred, and maintain our goal of an homogeneous population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What urgent financial and physical policies does the Minister intend to apply to overcome these fairly serious defects especially as they are capable of interpretation as evidence of <span class="highlight">racial</span> disadvantage and even <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination against  a  minority in our society? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the last part of his question may I say that I deplore <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I deplore any attempts to exploit the feeling that there might be <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he aware also that successive Ministers for Immigration have consistently, and quite rightly in my view, justified and supported the policy on moral, social and economic grounds evidently because of their belief that a government has a moral obligation to protect its own people particularly from <span class="highlight">racial</span> tensions and friction? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Prime Minister also state what is immoral about a policy that admits almost 10,000 non-Europeans and people of mixed descent yearly, gives discretionary power to the Minister, has kept Australia’ free from <span class="highlight">racial</span> hatreds and is based on the same principles as the immigration policies of practically every nation in the world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But “the honourable member has not concluded what I said, because I then went on to point out that in every country in the world in which there are significant groups of different <span class="highlight">racial</span> origin there are significant <span class="highlight">racial</span> tensions and they grow the greater the groups are, and this is true not only in countries such as the United States and Great Britain where we have seen it but in countries such as Malaya where Chinese-Malayan tensions are great, in Indonesia, in countries such as Kenya where they have tension with East Africans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the 2 things are entirely different though, of course, as we will have noticed with great regret in this nation, even though people may be of the same colour they do have, when they are <span class="highlight">racial</span> minorities of significance, tensions which can lead to the kind of actions which have recently been taking place in Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government knows, or should know, that it has the expertise to handle personal problems, whether they are <span class="highlight">racial</span>, such as some Aboriginal problems are social disadvantages, with which Aboriginals are afflicted, or economic disabilities, with which they are also afflicted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to assure the honourable member that careful consideration is being given to a suitable programme to observe the year 1971 in Australia as International Year for Action to Combat Racism and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia shares the concern of the United Nations at manifestations of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and intolerance and has frequently made this clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is this concern which led us in the United Nations General Assembly to vote in support of the resolution designating 1971 as International Year for Action to Combat Racism and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has signed the International Convention on the Elimination of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination and the question of its ratification is under consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard the honourable member may be interested to know that the United Nations Association of Australia, along with other interested non-governmental associations has set up a National Committee to plan the effective observance of the year, named the Australian Committee to Combat Racism and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While its programme is not yet finalised, I understand that it will include the dissemination of information about the relevant United Nations documents dealing with <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly does not, although it does mean an attitude of prudent caution, taking account not only of our own experience but also of the experience of other countries in accepting for permanent settlement large numbers of peoples with extremely different <span class="highlight">racial</span> origins, backgrounds and attitudes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was disappointed that at the conference to which I referred earlier there were people who talked about <span class="highlight">racial</span> equality, who opposed our so-called white Australia policy and who encouraged immigration on a non <span class="highlight">racial</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is selective, it is true: but it is selective because we wish to preserve a homogeneous population and because we have deliberately set out not to create a multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is significant <span class="highlight">racial</span> discontent in that country, which is what I am sure we jointly seek to avoid in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It immediately broke down any <span class="highlight">racial</span> problems or prejudice because they were able to talk in the common language of their new country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every day the story of their plight is being told, from the aged and needy in our great cities to the hungry people of India, from the orphans in East Pakistan - and there are some 27,000 known orphans from the cyclone- to the victims of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the offer by the Government to allow a multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span> team to be selected was a significant breakthrough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>MCC tours of South Africa have been called off until such time as cricket in South Africa is multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The West Indies, India and Pakistan do not play against South Africa because of South Africa’s <span class="highlight">racial</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This brings us to the present situation that has culminated in the South African Cricket Association’s request for two coloured players to be included in the team, rejection by the Government of multiracial touring teams and the subsequent dramatic walk-off by white South African cricketers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cricketers have completely overlooked the day to day change and current climate in South Africa and that firm support for the stand taken by the South African Cricket Association and their cricketers may be just the sort of pressure that needs to be exerted to end <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in cricket and permit South Africa to tour not only Australia but the rest of the cricketing nations of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just think that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination as practised by South Africa is worse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then makes the point that the question of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is a result of deliberate Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole point about the campaign against racialism in sport is that if South Africans could play sport across <span class="highlight">racial</span> lines, they would soon discover  a  common humanity, and notions of <span class="highlight">racial</span> superiority, or at least of <span class="highlight">racial</span> differences as being something all-important, would crumble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it would confront all Australians, and especially those concerned with the administration of sport, with the question of our tacit acceptance of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and political interference in sport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And as Australians are not altogether blameless in the matter of racialism, it could challenge us to face up to our own shortcomings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing could be better calculated to bring them to question their <span class="highlight">racial</span> policies: And there is no greater service one could render the white community in South Africa than this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the States, the statistics are based a great deal on conjecture because the necessary documents do not always contain information as to <span class="highlight">racial</span> origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the policy being followed lead to further charges of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By comparison, the migrant or Aboriginal child faces the massive obstacles of differences between his national and <span class="highlight">racial</span> cultures and the culture of the white Australian school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On what dates, at what level, by what means and with what results have there been discussions with the Queensland and Western Australian Governments on the laws of their States which do not satisfy the requirements of the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination (Hansard, 6th May 1970, page 1961 and 23rd September 1970, page 1583). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discussions about legislation in Queensland and Western Australia have dealt specifically with provisions which discriminate against Aboriginal Australians rather than generally with laws which do not satisfy the requirements of the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The stated reasons clearly indicated that the applicant’s expatriate <span class="highlight">racial</span> status was the major determining factor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, we have to face the situation posed by the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It appears that we will not be able to carry out our obligations in 1971 which the United Nations General Assembly has designated as International Year for Action to Combat Racism and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And, as I have stated already, there was the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination and the group of 1966 international convenants on human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If so, will he either (a) disclose that evidence to those who have objected to his tolerance of the South African foreign policy to choose international sporting teams exclusively from a <span class="highlight">racial</span> minority or (b) review his public comparison of the Soviet and South African regimes in this connection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-51-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What was the (a) date and (b) tenor of the information which Australia has given to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the programmes and activities undertaken during 1971, which the 1970 General Assembly designated as International Year for Action to Combat Racism and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-51-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately the Government has simply paid lip service to conventional criticism of racialism while putting the full force of its executive arms at the disposal of the ‘white man’s club’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is time that all the leaders in South East Asia - Lee Kuan Yew,  President  Marcos and all the other leaders in Asia - spoke out publicly and made it perfectly clear what they think of Australia and our entertainment of teams that are selected on a <span class="highlight">racial</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is so easy to exploit <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice, particularly in times such as the present when economic pressures exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wanted to make a brief reference to the fact that in this year, the year designated by the United Nations to combat racism and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, the Government has done virtually nothing through our school system to try to eliminate one of the great blights upon our society- - racism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mean prejudice of all kinds - religious, national and <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, unfortunately my impression of the greatest change was the dramatic growth in racialism and I left the Territory very concerned about Australia’s future relations with it, as I believe it is of paramount importance, not only to this generation but also to the future generations of Australians that a sound and friendly relationship and understanding of the problems of the people of Papua New Guinea and Australia should be forged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sorry to say that my impression is that a great deal of the blame for the growth of racialism rests with the attitudes of the great majority of the Europeans in the country, particularly those in commerce and industry, who have only their own self-gain in mind and who are not concerned with the problems of the indigenous people or with Australia’s relationship with them in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I believe that at least 75 per cent - to quote some old-time Australians who have been there for many years and who have made it their life’s work to help to develop the country- of the Australians there are not a good advertisement for our country and it is a pity that some way has not been found to cull them out and send them back to Australia in an endeavour to reduce the growing <span class="highlight">racial</span> tensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I announced in a statement on 22nd March 1971 to mark the International Year for Action to Combat Racism and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination, the Commonwealth made a specific grant of$12,000to assist the Australian Committee to Combat Racism and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination with its programme in connection with the Year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-34-17">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to make it quite clear that a change in the <span class="highlight">racial</span> problem was one of the changes I saw, and it was one of the greatest changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although migrants comprised 18.3 per cent of Australia’s total population, and 25.3 per cent of the total work force in 1966  -  and these proportions are most probably higher today - so far we have avoided any major clashes, the build up of ethnic groups in ghettoes or the development of <span class="highlight">racial</span> disharmony and tensions in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia can no longer afford to be’ lumped with South Africa as a country basing its policy on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Adelaide  (Mr Hurford)  lamented the fact that Australia has troops stationed in Malaysia and Singapore and he referred in particular to <span class="highlight">racial</span> tensions which may erupt into civil war within these 2 countries and other Asian countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This year is the International Year against <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, many of the civil and industrial disputes in our new partner in the Commonwealth will have <span class="highlight">racial</span> overtones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are people who perhaps provoke <span class="highlight">racial</span> division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Communist Party of Australia last year in the Tribune’ forecast, when it referred to a mass anti-racist movement attacking apartheid and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in both South Africa and Australia as being vital in the coming months, that this movement would be built up on militant mass action and would spread to support for the Gurindji and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been pointed out to me that some of those who talk most about racism seem bent on creating <span class="highlight">racial</span> conflict where none existed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as I shall indicate later, the evidence also points clearly to the fact that on 6th April last year he also misled Parliament, when he stated that he had already taken action by communicating the Australian people’s feelings on the <span class="highlight">racial</span> selection of a sporting team to the South African Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian people’s feelings on the <span class="highlight">racial</span> bias in the selection of sporting teams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We as a Government will go along with it in public because politics demand that we do so, but we are not really disturbed at your <span class="highlight">racial</span> policies, and we will not criticise you’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It bears also on the important question of the attitudes of the Prime Minister and his Government to <span class="highlight">racial</span> relations in South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the most surprising thing, which reflects upon the pathological tendencies of the Prime Minister in matters like this where veracity is concerned, is that only a few weeks later he was served up a question by the honourable member for Chisholm who asked whether he would take action about the <span class="highlight">racial</span> policies in the selection of sporting teams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He wrote a letter saying that the Labor Party would continue to struggle against <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and was firmly committed to oppose any sports team sent to Australia, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On behalf of New South Wales, however, it is strongly asserted that, as presently structured, the Sydney metropolis is a social phenomenon which is beyond human scale, that, while it has as yet been spared the consequences of serious <span class="highlight">racial</span> segregation, it nevertheless manifests a massive and increasing trend towards socio-income segregation; and that the higher order facilities of a big city (including central city job opportunities) are not in practice accessible to or utilised by its inhabitants to an extent commensurate with their apparent availability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even such matters as birth control and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination must surely be tied up in any education system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I say this I refer to the hungry people of Bangla Desh and India, the victims of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, and the orphans of the wars in Vietnam and Bangla Desh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it is a serious matter to make a <span class="highlight">racial</span> or anti-Semitic statement in a multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span> community such as Singapore as a senior supporter of the Government and indeed as a senior member of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we want to see is diplomatic initiatives based upon the fact that Australia can be a mutual and friendly partner with any country no matter what its government and no matter what its <span class="highlight">racial</span> structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Whatever be the truth of these allegations, will the right honourable gentleman assure the House that neither he nor any member who sits behind him on the Government benches would ever wish it to be thought that he or any of them would endorse, or would wish to be associated with, an expression of anti-Semitic sentiment or any sentiment based on religious or <span class="highlight">racial</span> grounds made by any member of the Government parties, if it were made? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The section has been inoperative for some time and, in accordance with the Government’s policy of eliminating any potential source of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, is being repealed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 23rd March - 4 weeks ago - this House unanimously carried a resolution against <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This motion states: That the Government should take effective legislative and administrative action to counter <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice and violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This motion recognises that <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice and violence cannot be eliminated simply by passing a law or by some administrative act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least it calls on the Government to take action to counter <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice and violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it is also one of the countries which is freest from <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Racial</span> prejudice is something that is deep in the heart of private individuals and is not readily controllable by legislative or administrative act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not say there is no prejudice but I do say that Australia is one of the countries freest from <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pass now to the question of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For our part, the Government is well aware of the resentment and frustration felt by the great majority of independent African countries, which constitute almost onethird of the United Nations membership, about the continued application of policies of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and minority rule in southern Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important, therefore, that we should emphasise that the policies of apartheid, <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and limited franchise being followed by certain governments in southern Africa find no support in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the contrary, the Government’s policy is one of promoting an integrated Australian society looking towards political and <span class="highlight">racial</span> equality for all, of supporting selfdetermination on the basis of majority rule, say for the people of Papua New Guinea, and of co-operating with the United Nations towards that end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the motion before the House the Australian Labor Party has chosen to level the charge of <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice and racism against this Government and this side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This charge of <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice in the present climate of world opinion, and very properly so, is a most grievous one to lay on any government or on any nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether true or false, every charge of <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice or racism damages the country against which it is made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has been damaged in the past by some who, for their own particular purposes, have laid against us recklessly, carelessly and without caring whether it be true or false the charge of racism and <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice, and a lot of them are on the Opposition side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Racial</span> prejudice, racism, is an ugly phrase which describes an ugly aspect of human relationships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Charges of <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice must be examined carefully, responsibly and dispassionately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Charges of <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice cannot be sustained against Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such an attitude is not racist, since it is based not on <span class="highlight">racial</span> bigotry or superiority, <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the Government’s policies have been deliberately aimed at preventing the emergence of those conditions under which <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice flourishes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is significant that critics can point only to isolated instances of alleged <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By some strange alchemy of words, Australia’s responsible and effective policy of avoiding the creation of circumstances which could lead to <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice is represented as <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are left by the critics - and many of them are opposite - with the paradox that only by taking action which could lead to <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice could we avoid charges of <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who has moved, by appearing to abandon traditional policies, to create doubts in the minds of the Australian public that the conditions in which <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice could flourish might be created? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who jeers at the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell)  every time he stands firm for policies which will not create conditions in which <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice will flourish? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not we - ‘the people who are being accused by this motion - who are taking the risk that by a conscious act of policy or a series of administrative acts the conditions will be created in which <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice will grow and flourish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To retreat from our present policies, as the Labor Party proposes that we do, would be to lend credence to charges of <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I said earlier that, whether true or false, every charge of <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice damages the country against which it is made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, this morning the Opposition moved a motion in respect of what it called <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice within Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Did he discuss with the Prime Minister a further possible protest to the South African Government against its <span class="highlight">racial</span> sporting policies as mentioned by the Prime Minister on 9th September 1971 (Hansard, page 989)? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-43-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3669 which I placed on the Notice Paper on 17th August 1971, that the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination was briefly discussed at meetings of Commonwealth and State officials and Ministers in Cairns in April 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-36-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to be in conflict with a letter that you,  Mr Speaker,  wrote to me two or three weeks ago after I had drawn your attention to the fact that some material from a person called Russell in Queensland which had been circulated through the House attendants, in my opinion contained some objectionable <span class="highlight">racial</span> propaganda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wondered at the contrast between your standard in relation to <span class="highlight">racial</span> propaganda from  Mr Russell  and your standard on some reference to sex in relation to Germaine Greer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s <span class="highlight">racial</span> policies already stick in the throats of Asian nations, and with the SEATO conference opening in Canberra next month the Government apparently felt that the embassy’s continued presence (within sight of the conference hall) could bring even worse problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the situation is aggravated where the depressed are a different <span class="highlight">racial</span> group, such as negroes or Puerto Ricans, subject to discrimination, but it is bad without that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Maybe I am easily depressed but few things upset me more than the hypocritical patio intellectuals who lecture us on <span class="highlight">racial</span> equality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they believe in <span class="highlight">racial</span> equality, then why not compare them with Aryan, northern European professional and business people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that if they want to continue to live iri a country with one of the highest standards of living in the world, in a country which is free from <span class="highlight">racial</span> strife, in a country which provides incentives for those who are prepared to work and in a country which offers security to its citizens, they can ensure this by working for and voting for the return of this Liberal-Country Party Government which has served them so well over the past 23 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia’s migration policy has aimed at maintaining a homogeneous population to avoid the <span class="highlight">racial</span> problems which are so apparent, and so explosive, in certain other countries, yet at the same time we have allowed into our country, approximately 9,000 non-Europeans per annum, a figure which it is felt Australia can readily absorb without undue strain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although this legislation applies to a relatively small number of persons,  Mr Speaker,  as approximately 760 Torres Strait Islanders and 40 mainland Aborigi nals served during World War II in the Torres Strait Light Infantry Forces, it is nevertheless important as another move in the Federal Government’s avowed intention to remove the last remnants of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination from the statute books. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said at the outset - I suppose one can always learn something new in this Parliament - I had no knowledge of the discrimination that applied in relation to those from this area served in the armed forces during the Second World War, But at least the Minister for Repatriation  (Mr Holten)  and the Government have now accepted that there should not be any <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and the Bill which we now have before us provides for this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With a view to ratification of the International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination it is necessary that this legislative provision, which is discriminatory on <span class="highlight">racial</span> grounds, be removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The action of the Government in making the repeal of these discriminatory provisions one of its first legislative acts is a token of our determination to banish <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination within our community and is also a step towards building on equal terms the family of the nation in citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As my colleague, the honourable member for Flinders, pointed out, a great proportion of this discriminatory legislation was not based upon discrimination on <span class="highlight">racial</span> grounds originally, but was part of the protective mantle which it was believed necessary to place around the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As no action has been taken by the Queensland Government on these matters, provisions were included in the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill 1973 to supersede the Queensland law that authorised the management of the property of Aboriginals and Islanders without their consent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is asserted in this Convention that aU human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that any doctrine of superiority based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and without any justification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Legislation has a vital role to play in the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and the enactment of this Bill is a fundamental step, a condition precedent, it could be said, that must be taken if Australia is to ratify the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, the Bill establishes formal administrative machinery for the examination of complaints of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination on a systematic basis and for the settlement of complaints by conciliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also for this reason recognises that an emphasis on mediation and conciliation is a more satisfactory way of tackling individual instances of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and the tensions that are associated with individual disputes A Commissioner for Community Relations will be established as an independent statutory authority to undertake these tasks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Overseas experience has shown that the success of legislation dealing with <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination depends very much on the effectiveness of programs of this kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both governmental and community-based programs to combat <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination are necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Bill, the Commissioner will have the function of conducting and fostering programs of education and research to combat <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, and a Community Relations Council will be established with an advisory role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia will be required by Article 7 of the Convention to conduct programs of this kind to combat <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will provide the basis upon which Australia can comply with the obligations imposed by the Convention on <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The educative role is at least as significant and the Bill recognises that there must also be effective and systematic enforcement of rights and the promotion of education and research, if the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in this country is to be achieved in fact as well as in theory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General  (Mr Enderby)  has just delivered a second reading speech relating to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument which has been advanced by the Government in support of the attitude it has adopted towards cricket contests between Australia and South Africa is that South African cricket teams are chosen on a <span class="highlight">racial</span> basis, that is, that they are chosen on a basis which prevents persons of mixed and coloured blood from participating in South African teams which play against those of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that does not alter the principle that if the foreign relations of this country are going to be conducted with any consistency and if we are ever going to achieve a situation in which the horrible <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination which does occur in South Africa and which is probably a level of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination which is duplicated in many countries throuhout the world is ever going to be broken down we are not going to break it down by hermetically sealing off South Africa from the rest of the world, we are not going to break it down by having no contact with the South Africans and we are certainly not going to break it down by preventing cricket contests between South Africa and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: while the House supports the Bill’s condemnation of acts of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination it is of the opinion that the Bill should be substantially amended because it- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I begin by stating- I trust with some particularity; I hope, further, with some clarity- the Opposition’s attitude to the question of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination before I come to deal with the provisions in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing I want to say is this: The Opposition condemns, without the slightest sense of inhibition, <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The breaking point will be hastened if those who find themselves in <span class="highlight">racial</span> conflict also find themselves in possession of the weapons of mass destruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are opposed unequivocally to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say with no ambiguity and no equivocation that the Opposition is opposed to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second matter to which I draw the attention of the House with regard to this Bill is that in the gathering of powers conferred upon this Parliament there is absolutely nothing which gives to this Parliament an explicit right to legislate upon the question of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was my kidney of government that signed the convention dealing with <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination- 1966 circa- and now the Bill is to be ratified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill seeks to outlaw <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and the various manifestations of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, I am seeking to assert the thesis that it is the view of this entire Parliament that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, one of the disfigurements of the 20th century, should be silenced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill seeks to establish, among other things, tribunals relating to the hearings of matters with respect to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second part of the Bill deals with the prohibition of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and it sets out what I may describe as the particulars of offences of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are proposing by dint of this Bill that the transgressions with respect to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination should be solved by erecting an apparatus which would be more suited for a totalitarian country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seeks to put into legislative form the man who comes along and says: ‘Jones has treated so-and-so in a shabby fashion, which infringes Part II of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is unequivocally opposed to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt that in Australia since the white man arrived there has been a history of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination against the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Countries which have tasted colonialism- or, rather, provided a feast for the imperial powers; countries where there has been inequality; countries in which the stirrings of nationalism have joined in complex relationships with ideologies; countries in which there are cultural or <span class="highlight">racial</span> differences: There is no identikit to fit all of the nations, but the common thread is the need for reform- social reform, political reform, agrarian reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people think that there is no <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the contrary, <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is found at the highest levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill is long overdue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With such bigoted persons as those to whom I referred adorning the Opposition benches, is there any wonder that when they were in government they never introduced a Bill to ratify the International Convention on <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think such action helps the cause to the conclusion which I believe we are all seeking to see achieved, that is, a diminution in any discrimination or <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice which obtains in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has introduced the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill into this House after 3 Bills on the same subject had been introduced previously in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the words of the Attorney-General  (Mr Enderby)  ‘The purpose of the Bill is to make <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination unlawful in Australia and to provide an effective means of combatting <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice in our country’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are dealing tonight with discrimination- not only <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination but discrimination against people of different nationalities as well as of different races. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously if this Bill does increase <span class="highlight">racial</span> tensions, its operation will be counter-productive and the individuals it seeks to assist will be far worse off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further matter that should be investigated at the Committee stage is that the Bill carries with it an underlying presumption that all <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is deliberate, which I dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am merely pointing out that there are many situations where unintentional discrimination and <span class="highlight">racial</span> intolerance do take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A thorough educational program of pointing out our <span class="highlight">racial</span> problems and difficulties in society would for the most part overcome those situations based on ignorance rather than malicious intent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One should also note that the Bill covers only <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To concentrate solely on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is to run the risk of over.simplifying the issue of discrimination as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is readily discernible and more easily demonstrable, but other areas of prejudice should not go unnoticed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Careful immigration programs and selection process of course are major factors in smooth <span class="highlight">racial</span> inter-relations in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the main, whilst many migrants will be able to complain of individual instances of prejudice or discrimination that they personally have experienced, Australia has developed with their help and effort, largely free from significant <span class="highlight">racial</span> or cultural prejudice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is with that background in mind that we should assess the structure and functions of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill as presented to the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome the opportunity being provided to fulfil the obligations that Australia has undertaken with the United Nations in relation to the international conventions on the elimination of all forms of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reiterate that much can be gained by the passage of this Bill, bearing in mind the necessary modifications that we of the Opposition will outline, not only by Australia as a nation showing itself to be mature enough to tackle the problems of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination but also by each individual who has for so long been disadvantaged by the sad deficiencies in our present system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1975 we have suddenly found it necessary to introduce legislation to prevent <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, the Bill seeks to ensure that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination should be proscribed by law and fundamental rights and freedoms, without distinction as to race, should be guaranteed by law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Third, the Bill embodies the principle that there should be established formal administrative machinery to investigate individual instances of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and attempt to achieve a settlement of issues by conciliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourth, the Bill proposes that there should be fostered- and I believe that this is very important- programs of education and research and other programs to combat <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among <span class="highlight">racial</span> and ethnic groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill in its present form will sow the seeds of hatred, <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice, ill-will and disruption among our people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides a healthy breeding ground for sneaks, informers, pimps, jealousy and revenge, and an army of <span class="highlight">racial</span> officials whose role will be of an inquisitorial nature with wide powers of law enforcement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of ending hostility and <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice between different <span class="highlight">racial</span> and ethnic groups in our community, the enforcement of the provisions of this Bill will foment and exacerbate hostility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All compassionate and sensible people would aspire to end <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination has characterised modern history as man of different ethnic origins has achieved greater mobility enabling him to move rapidly from his own environment to the environments of other ethnic groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the last centruy and this century the spirit of nationalism has tended to foster <span class="highlight">racial</span> competition, prejudice and racist attitudes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is to promote an understanding and an acceptance of the Act by developing and conducting research and educational programs to combat <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 28 makes it an offence to disseminate ideas based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> superiority or hatred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One does not sweep <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice under the rug by legislative process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, I think there is evidence to show that, if anything, legislation that outlaws <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination has had some effect in countries where it exists, such as in Canada and in the United States of America where the Constitution is being used to outlaw it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we reject all theories of <span class="highlight">racial</span> superiority or inferiority, if we genuinely believe that the only differences between the peoples of the world are physical, cultural and environmental differences then we must ask ourselves why it is that <span class="highlight">racial</span> antagonism still exists in today’s society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attitudes changed slowly over the years until by the 1930s official attitudes at least had, with a few exceptions, ceased to propagate theories of <span class="highlight">racial</span> superiority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is the legislative portion attempting to outlaw acts of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is that all Aborigines are branded with inherent <span class="highlight">racial</span> characteristics and inherent patterns of social behaviour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But legislation of this nature will make sure that they are equally careful not to eliminate somebody from consideration on a <span class="highlight">racial</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, every person in the community of a <span class="highlight">racial</span> ethnic national group should be very careful when he or she makes any statement or exerts any pressure in the community that he does not say anything which will have an effect out of proportion to the group’s numbers in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether I can convince them that they are wrong but I genuinely believe that legislation used with discrimination, not used with the mailed fist, can be the framework for the next great push in Australia to eliminate racism and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was at least gracious enough to concede that the sincerity with which members of the Liberal and Country Parties oppose <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is not in dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a difference of opinion in this House on this legislation but it is not a difference of opinion regarding the abhorrence of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination; it is rather a difference of opinion as to the best method by which the problem of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in our society can be handled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to canvass the evidence of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, much of which has already been alluded to during the earlier part of the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that in certain areas of Australia the level and the incidence of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is totally unacceptable and that methods must be devised to eradicate such incidence and to bring down such level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was expressly conceded that the best hope of advancing the field of the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination was to be found in the processes of conciliation and of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We concede- no, we go further, we totally endorse- the declared intention of this legislation to eliminate forms of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that there will be some on the Government side who will immediately say that the Opposition is speaking with 2 voices, that on the one hand we say that we are against <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination but on the other hand we want so to emasculate the Bill that it will not be possible for any effective steps to be taken against the incidence of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our society there is a very strong body of opinion- it was given eloquent expression by the honourable member for Gwydir  (Mr Hunt)that  we will not lessen the incidence of <span class="highlight">racial</span> tension and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination by passing fairly stringent laws about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that they have been successful, but I would ask the Government to consider the fact that, while there is a problem of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia, there are significant differences between the problem that we have and the problem experienced in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great difficulties about this legislation, because it is to have Australia-wide application, is that while there are serious problems in certain areas of Australia there are large areas of Australia where legislation in the form proposed by the Government could be quite inappropriate, for the reasons outlined by the honourable member for Gwydir  (Mr Hunt)  and others, particularly as it is a first go at some kind of legislative proscription of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me hasten to say here and now that the whole idea behind this Bill- the prevention of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination- must be supported, but the manner in which these clauses have been drafted and the hidden meaning that appears to me to be behind them could spell disaster for many an innocent citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know the argument that an act of inciting <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is in some respects more despicable than individual acts of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, because the presence of intent by a person who incites an act of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination can hardly be called in to question whereas the intent of a person who commits an act of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination- certainly some of the acts of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination as they are prescribed in the language of this legislation- may not be quite the same malicious intent as that of the person who incites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, that notwithstanding, the Opposition feels that the penalty or the consequences for inciting an act of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination ought still to be civil matters and that they ought to follow the pattern which the Opposition has endeavoured to establish with its other amendments to the procedures to follow complaints of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Attorney-General to contemplate the situation that could arise where, in plain language, there is a racially bigoted estate agent and a perfectly tolerant vendor and, just because the tolerant vendor strictly speaking does not comply with the exemptions which are in clause 17, he could find himself in a most unfortunate situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given that the Government is going to create a category of offences in respect of the letting and sale of property, I accept that there is a very strong argument in some way to bring in principals; but the Opposition is unhappy with the possible consequences of clause 17 to people who have no thought of discriminating on <span class="highlight">racial</span> grounds and who could be the unwitting victims of discriminatory acts by their agents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognise that there are arguments to the contrary and that where there is a mixture of reasons some might argue that it is sufficient that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination be a substantial reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Opposition believes that it should be the dominant reason for the doing of the act so that in all the circumstances it is fair to say that the reason why a person acted in a particular way was on the ground of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that quite deservedly it will catch a lot of people but it will also catch some people who have unwittingly committed acts of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We therefore think it is necessary in all the circumstances that there be no doubt that the reason why a person has done an act complained of is by reason of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Implicit in both the contribution from the honourable member for Bennelong  (Mr Howard)  and the honourable member for Moore  (Mr Hyde)  has been the difficulty of the task which is posed by this <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>combating <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and prejudices that lead to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>promoting understanding, tolerance and friendship among <span class="highlight">racial</span> and ethnic groups; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His role shall be merely to conciliate in an effort to effect settlement of differences which arise out of acts alleged to be acts of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday I spoke as strongly as I could on the fact that most <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia, I believe, comes about through inadvertence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the first time that an Australian government has ever sought to tackle <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia with a law of this sort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one seeks to enact a law for the whole of Australia one has to realise that there are different parts of Australia- different in the sense that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination might be found to be more extensive in some parts than in others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think one of the Opposition speakers mentioned that in Australia generally <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, where it occurred, was often inadvertent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment provides that a person who is unhappy with the conciliation process, a person who complains that he or she has been a victim of an act of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and feels that nothing has been achieved can go to a civil court and commence proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction for any of the remedies which are set out in clause 26. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, the Opposition very sincerely asks the Government to consider the sort of procedure we have in mind, which admittedly is a softer approach to the treatment of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination than that desired by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand, there is the demand to eliminate acts of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition accepts that any acts which incite <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination ought to be made unlawful, and in fact the earlier sections of this Bill do make that sort of behaviour unlawful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again, this was part of the pattern of amendments put down by the Opposition which believes that acts inciting <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination should attract the same types of consequences as those acts themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provided, however, that such measures do not, as a consequence, lead to the maintenance of separate rights for different <span class="highlight">racial</span> groups and that they shall not be continued after the objectives for which they were taken have been achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that everybody on both sides of the House approves of the objectives of this BUI- I certainly approve of themwhich are not to maintain a stance of <span class="highlight">racial</span> superiority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this Bill, unhappily, will cause more <span class="highlight">racial</span> tension than it will alleviate and that it will add to the very problems that it is meant to solve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one is a greater admirer of the common law and the ways in which it can achieve progress than I am but it has been a dismal failure in terms of trying to give relief where <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not blame legislation like this that has appeared around the world for the rising tide of <span class="highlight">racial</span> anger that exists in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation has been in response to that rising tide of <span class="highlight">racial</span> anger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My God, <span class="highlight">racial</span> relations in the United States of America have been transformed, and transformed for the better, as a result of legislation in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone has conceded that this is a serious attempt to do something about <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation, seen against the background of the <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination Bills and other legislation which the Government has introduced or proposes to introduce, is designed to remove from the Queensland legislation certain discriminatory laws or certain discriminatory sections of existing laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have earlier this day addressed ourselves to the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill which flowed from a resolution of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination from the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The chief feature of that Bill, as honourable members will recall, and its pertinence to the matter now being discussed is that by the introduction of penalties we will be able to achieve what understanding and reason have not been able to achieve previously, notwithstanding that the resolution, as evidenced in the Schedule attached to the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill, insists that we are to promote and encourage universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, we swing back to features of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill which would necessitate that if one of these Aborigines from a reserve or, to a lesser extent, one of these Torres Strait Islanders who ethnically seem to demonstrate an all-round greater ability in their original state should apply for a position in this outside world and find that because of lack of opportunity he is not up to the job and preference is given to a non-Aboriginal, immediately, under the terms of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill, an employer who decides to exercise that preference is liable because of all the reasons advanced for discrimination against the appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">racial</span> element will be considered as the determining factor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last week I participated in the debate on the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill- a Bill I had wanted to see introduced long before I came to this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am convinced that the international pressures on that area are based primarily on strategic concepts and only secondarily on <span class="highlight">racial</span> issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that because <span class="highlight">racial</span> issues also exist in quite a number of other countries that are not subjected to similar pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia should plan to avoid any conflicts or frictions arising from <span class="highlight">racial</span> or national differences and while doing so should be liberal in admission to Australia of people of any race or nationality who desire to come, especially those who are suffering from reprisals or discrimination in some other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to such matters as the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill, the attempts to gerrymander the electorate in order to sustain an authoritarian system of democracy; and various Constitution Bills that were knocked back by the Senate and the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate has amended the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill in a number of respects, the most important of which are as follows: First, the power vested in the Commissioner for Community Relations to commence legal proceedings where he is unable to effect a settlement by conciliation has been removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Third, offences relating to increment and the promotion of <span class="highlight">racial</span> hatred that are required by the International Convention have been removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government would also have much preferred the inclusion of the offences relating to incitment and the promotion of <span class="highlight">racial</span> hatred so that the requirements of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination could have been followed more closely in Australian law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation will declare <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination unlawful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commissioner will have power to engage in programs of education and research to combat <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It applies to a broader range of acts based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination than is found in overseas legislation and contains fewer exceptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that the amendments will have the effect of replacing the blunt instrument of the Bill as originally presented with a process of conciliation and education which we believe will do a great deal more effectively to reduce the incidence of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia than would have been the case with the Bill in its original form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt, as the AttorneyGeneral  (Mr Enderby)  said, that a common ground exists between the Government and the Opposition concerning the abhorrence of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout the Australian community there are many people of good will, without <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice, who do not believe that one achieves anything in a reduction of <span class="highlight">racial</span> tension by passing the type of legislation that the Government originally wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are in fact a great number of people of similar good will who believe that one does nothing towards reducing the incidence of <span class="highlight">racial</span> tension by legislative coercion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was for that reason, and not because of any reluctance to oppose <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, that the Opposition moved the amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problems of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and <span class="highlight">racial</span> tensions in the United Kingdom are vastly different from problems of the same nature in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no posturing about the Opposition’s attitude towards the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my colleague has stressed, we are as much against <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination as anybody in the land but we believe that the original proposals put forward by the Government were perhaps a little bit too enthusiastic in some areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my colleague has said, our attitude was engendered by a genuine desire to bring about a reduction in that little bit of <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice which was not inadvertent and, as the honourable member for Bennelong said, we rejected the blunt instrument approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it is a step forward in bringing about a realisation within the total Australian society that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, which I firmly believe is largely inadvertent, should not be countenanced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of people are opposed to a <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I personally believe that a <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination Act, as this will now become, embodying as it does the aspirations of our society for attitudes that ought to exist between individuals in the society will, in the end, promote the proper relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other resolutions of the United Nations dealing with discrimination in sport on <span class="highlight">racial</span> grounds; there are none dealing with discrimination in sport on the grounds of sex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, it should be carefully observed that this was the first time that Australia had instigated with regard to <span class="highlight">racial</span> origins resettlement opportunities for Asian displaced persons who were not readily identified or connected with this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from the normal criteria which apply to any intending entrant to Australia, the only other criterion used to decide which South Africans will be granted entry visas into Australia is that they should not be entering as members or representatives of sporting teams, cultural or other organisations selected or structured on a <span class="highlight">racial</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-30-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The overriding cause of the problems facing the mining industry is the policies of the present Federal Government, particularly the twisted ideological <span class="highlight">racial</span> obsession and motivation of the Minister for Minerals and Energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the field of the protection of human rights, the Parliament will recall that very important law, the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act, which established a Commissioner for Community Relations and also a Community Relations Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the Australian Legal Aid Office, the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act and the many other initiatives of this Government will help to right the imbalance, help to ensure that the migrant communities can play an active role in Australian society with a minimum of social cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The same thing happened in the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill where the Minister and the Commissioner had overpowering and tremendous powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To summarise the terms of the Convention, States Parties thereto declare that Apartheid is a crime against humanity and that acts resulting from the policies and practices of Apartheid and similar policies and practices of <span class="highlight">racial</span> segregation and discrimination are crimes violating the principles of International Law, in particular the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and constituting a serious threat to international peace and security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-15">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But surely in the interests of <span class="highlight">racial</span> harmony and of the acceptance of the Government’s program- it involves expenditure in excess of $3 5m- of the acceptance of the program of housing these people in the cities, it would be wise not to flutter a flag which could initiate or awaken racism which may be nonexistent or dormant in the minds and hearts of white people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So once again inadvertently or purposely- I do not know what motivates the Minister- we are contributing to <span class="highlight">racial</span> tension and ill-will by the noise and disturbance which come from so many people living in the one residence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In-line with its general policy towards apartheid, the Australian Government firmly opposes <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in sport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that the maintenance of sporting relations with South Africa should depend on that country’s willingness and ability to move away from <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in sport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Prime Minister has indicated, Australia will apply the test of selection on a proper multiracial basis to determine whether South African sporting teams will be permitted to compete in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will continue to support appropriate measures in the United Nations and elsewhere aimed at bringing an end to the practice of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, not only in Africa but wherever it exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is also opposed to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in sport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this Government, the basic condition will be South Africa’s willingness and ability to move away from <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in sport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has indicated, we will apply the test of selection on a proper multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, we would hope and expect that Australian sportsmen would note the Government’s views on multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span> competition and would take these fully into account in any plans they may have to compete in South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of those most responsible for <span class="highlight">racial</span> outbursts was the honourable member for Cunningham  (Mr Connor). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It strove to reintroduce class distinctions, an industrial and political elite, a <span class="highlight">racial</span> background for social division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Indeed, two of the cuts cast serious doubts on Australia’s status as a signatory to the United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I referred earlier to the fact that the cuts cast serious doubts on whether we have fulfilled our obligations under the United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We became party to this Convention with the passing of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act of 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the new Government has effectively prevented the full expression of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act and has rendered impossible one of the key provisions of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Government is not prepared to allow the Council to be established, I ask the Minister whether he will give effect to article 14 ( 1 ) of the Schedule of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That article provides that a State Party may at any time declare that it recognises the competence of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination to receive and consider communications from individuals or groups of individuals within its jurisdiction claiming to be victims of a violation by that State Party of any of the rights set forth in the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>States Parties undertake to adopt immediate and effective measures particularly in the fields of teaching, education, culture and information with a view to combating prejudices which lead to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and to promoting understanding, tolerance and friendship among nations and <span class="highlight">racial</span> or ethnical groups, as well as to propagating the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But before I outline the ways in which the cuts have had this effect, it is worth noting the views of the present Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs when the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act was debated on 8 April 1975 and he was speaking for the then Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This cut has totally negated the educational component of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The trusted lieutenant he sought out as his aide in this seamy exercise and towards whom he now feels so much affinity, a  Mr Wiley  Fancher, landed in this country in order to protect the integrity of his <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that we can look forward to the day when <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice will be a thing of the past, but we must honestly admit that racism does exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until the end of 1972, on every <span class="highlight">racial</span> issue Australia, New Zealand, Portugal and South Africa stood alone, sometimes beside France, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Fraser Government has now given its blessing to renewed sporting contacts between racially selected sporting teams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s connivance at <span class="highlight">racial</span> sporting contacts has once again exposed the weakness and hypocrisy of the Australian Foreign Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 4 March, the Minister told the Parliament that in deciding what sporting contacts would be permitted with South Africa: the basic condition will be South Africa’s willingness and ability to move away from <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in sport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me make it clear, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  has made it clear on many occasions in this place that in line with its general attitude towards the apartheid system, the Australian Government firmly opposes <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in sport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is but one hope for these tragic peopleblack and white- in South Africa if more violence is to be averted and that is that there be detente at home as well as abroad for them and that there be an incredibly radical change in the thinking of the overwhelming majority of white people into realising that a multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span> society that is built on the principle of human dignity for all- black as well as white- is the only hope for their future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>New Zealand is one country that may be pointed at as having genuine <span class="highlight">racial</span> harmony. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are we to ban all Russians because Russians have demonstrated over many years that they have a very solid <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice against Jews? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We need action on <span class="highlight">racial</span> harmony. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will recall that last year the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act was passed by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs who is responsible for administering the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to stress that the Commissioner for Community Relations is a statutory officer with certain functions set down in the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act of 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government supports the principles on which the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act of 1975 is based and adheres firmly to the International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination which Australia has ratified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That booklet contains a short foreword and a list of 23 organisations which the Commissioner regards as propagating <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All honourable gentlemen are opposed to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and the Government is committed to its elimination in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr David Moran, who was working with Professor Hollow’s team, is reported as having said that poor education, virtually a total absence of housing, toilets or clean water, high unemployment, <span class="highlight">racial</span> tension, gross poverty and the inability of existing medical services to cope were the problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of the House to a scurrilous advertisement that appeared in the  Australian  of 29 October last, which sets out the most infamous resolution ever passed by the United Nations, whereby Zionism was said to foster the growth of racism and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Racism and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, including apartheid, are abhorrent not only to the people of Israel but also to all other peoples of the world who similarly cherish democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never let it be forgotten that the Jews themselves are the classic victims of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and that their martyrs over the centuries run into tens of millions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a sequel, it was necessary for the Australian Government to introduce the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act which was assented to on 19 June 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social, economic, ecological and environmental deterioration which are exemplified at the national and international levels by inequalities in living conditions, social segregation, <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, acute unemployment, illiteracy, disease and poverty, the breakdown of social relationships and traditional cultural values and the increasing degradation of life-supporting resources of air, water and land; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore the duty of all people and Governments to join the struggle against any form of colonialism, foreign aggression and occupation, domination, apartheid and all forms of racism and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination referred to in the resolutions as adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of special importance is the elimination of social and <span class="highlight">racial</span> segregation,  inter alia,  through the creation of better balanced communities, which blend different social groups, occupation, housing and amenities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pursuant to section 46 of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975 I present the first annual report of the Commissioner for Community Relations for the year ended 30 June 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One particular matter to which I would like to refer relates to the assertion that there is a widespread breach of our international obligations under the international convention on the elimination of all forms of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The initiative to combat <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination was taken by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly the rights of the Aboriginal people to land will be swept under the carpet, just like South Africa’s apartheid and many of the other <span class="highlight">racial</span> issues which were ignored in the past and now have become major world issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has practised social ostracism and even <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and petty obstruction against highly skilled specialists in a way which is contrary to the so-called ethical standards of the medical profession and in total disregard of the interests of the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have also said that we will not support or welcome to Australia sporting teams which are selected on a <span class="highlight">racial</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When dealing with South Africa the Minister stated that we are maintaining a policy of correct diplomatic relations with South Africa to oppose without reservation that country’s policies of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr Grassby is currently using his position of great, and almost unlimited, power to pursue an issue under the guise of seeking <span class="highlight">racial</span> harmony when his motives are blatantly political. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975 states clearly that the Commissioner should throw out a complaint if he believes the complaint to be quite frivolous, vexatious or not made in good faith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some Australians are genuinely concerned about the possibility of <span class="highlight">racial</span> and ethnic tensions, evident in other countries, developing in Australia as a result of continued migration from particular sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By condoning this situation we are condoning a far more subtle, and in the long term effects, a more drastic form of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination than anything known or practised hitherto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal and National Country Parties are committed to the preservation and development of a culturally diversified but socially cohesive Australian society free of <span class="highlight">racial</span> tensions and offering security, well-being and equality of opportunity to all those living here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They argue that as sporting teams come and performteams selected on a <span class="highlight">racial</span> basis- that is not something which should concern governments or in which governments should take some action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Royal Commission report ranges over such diverse things as the development of the Island’s economy, whether cows and horses should be able to continue to roam across it, whether duty free status should be continued, whether there should be a law library on the Island; matrimonial causes, legal aid, a prison and law enforcement, <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, unionism and social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason, I can assure the honourable gentleman that there is no suggestion of our severing diplomatic ties with the Republic, but there is a hope that as a result of calmness and reason it might see fit to change its <span class="highlight">racial</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(a) At the census of 1966, 6048 persons describing themselves as of Chinese <span class="highlight">racial</span> origin were resident in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-56-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The above statistics refer to Chinese as defined by <span class="highlight">racial</span> origin, not by birthplace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-56-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my allegations subsequently have been proved correct and no malice was intended on my part, does my experience testify to the fact that the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act can in some instances work against the freedom and rights of everyone? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Associated with that measure will be amendments to the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act as it is presently framed the Commissioner for Community Relations on receipt of a complaint which has, of course, to come from the person aggrieved or affected by the incident complained about, does have the power to refuse to entertain a complaint on certain grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that respect, again I can only say to him that I will give attention to it when considering amendments to the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will vest in the Commission functions under other Acts, such as the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act, relating to human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There also has been a movement towards the introduction of legislation on specific matters, such as <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, discrimination on grounds of sex or marital status, criminal investigation and invasions of privacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission is to have functions under other Commonwealth Acts- such as the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act- or under a State Act that vests functions in the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The newspaper report alleged that  Mr Grassby  claimed that even in newly produced Japanese textbooks, Australian characteristics were held to include “<span class="highlight">racial</span> bias”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act, this amounts to a slur upon the Japanese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would appreciate your immediately commencing an investigation in accordance with the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discriminauon Act, Part II, Section 9( 1 ). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In making these sinister accusations he has been undeterred by the complete lack of evidence to support his charges and apparently is in no way bothered by the thought that he may be fanning the flames of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discord and intolerance, which could have devastating implications for a multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span> society such as Australia is today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when that section is narrowed to a <span class="highlight">racial</span> group and totally unsubstantiated sweeping allegations are made in regard to them, one is playing with fire, particularly in a multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span> society such as ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that becomes a widespread belief then the basis for racialism, discrimination and perhaps worse is established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia can ill-afford to fan the flames of <span class="highlight">racial</span> tension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major problem to be faced with regard to the Palestinians is that they are a <span class="highlight">racial</span> entity and are recognised as such by the world community, and of course by the United Nations, which has given them the status of observers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Historically, it can be said with complete justification that in terms of their <span class="highlight">racial</span> and ethnic origins the Palestinians are as mixed as the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Newspaper headlines this week and an answer given by the Minister for Immigration this morning provide even more grounds for concern about  Mr Grassby  ‘s suitability to hold down even a clerk’s job in the Public Service, let alone the position of a $44,000 a year commissioner who is supposed to mediate in cases in which it is alleged that <span class="highlight">racial</span> overtones might exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognise the fundamental right of Aborigines to retain their <span class="highlight">racial</span> identify and traditional life style . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Grassby,  with the powers which he holds under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act as the Commissioner, has an obligation to come to grips with the matter and to say to  Senator Colston: ‘Mr Cameron  claimed that a group of people were doing this? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will produce <span class="highlight">racial</span> tensions and conflicts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has written to me, informing me- his letter is dated 22 September- that under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act such inquiries are to be made only by the Commissioner himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-13-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The activities of the Government from the time it took office have been directed towards getting rid of Grassby or, alternatively, of getting the Office into an area where he would be suppressed so that he could not carry out his role of providing protection against <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not suggesting that he is involved in organised crime, but having been a barrister in Sydney and having been a man of the world in Sydney, I think he would agree with me that the proportion of people involved in criminal activities probably does not vary much between people of different <span class="highlight">racial</span> origins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do, however, believe it is not in the best interest of citizenship ceremonies if party political, sectarial or <span class="highlight">racial</span> statements are made at those ceremonies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most Aboriginal Australians claim distinctive <span class="highlight">racial</span> identities and it is certainly not an act of discrimation to record who they are in relevant administrative records. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-23-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This organisation is strongly opposed by many groups in Australia, including the East Timor Association, the Aboriginal land rights groups, the Campaign Against <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Exploitation, the Australian independence movement and the Australian Union of Students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, since the Employment Discrimination Committees were established, the Commonwealth has enacted its <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975 and, in addition, the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Act 1977, the Victorian Equal Opportunity Act 1977, as well as the South Australian Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1976, have been adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This failure to meet the needs of Aboriginal students is at least in part due to socio-economic factors, <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice, cultural irrelevancy and inappropriate teaching and curriculum resulting in high absenteeism and dropout rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, if somebody said that he was discriminated against in his employment or in some other way- even on a <span class="highlight">racial</span> or sexist basis- he would be able to go to a commission and put the matter before the commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am on record in this House as having said that I do not believe that apartheid is the answer to South Africa’s <span class="highlight">racial</span> problems, but it is sheer lunacy to damage Australia’s export trade to that country because of its internal policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me not dwell on this aspect any longer, other than to reaffirm that I believe any political, religious or <span class="highlight">racial</span> refugee should be able to seek refuge, temporary at least if not permanent, in this rich, secure, free country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an element of <span class="highlight">racial</span> exploitation in this thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may also be an assumption of <span class="highlight">racial</span> superiority, that is, that Australians are too good for light industrial and industrial ‘dirty work’ but others do not mind doing it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the <span class="highlight">racial</span> imbalance, the whites control approximately 87 per cent of the total land area in South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The authority of that legislation, in conjunction with the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act of 1975, the Aboriginal Land Fund Act and the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act of 1976 gave the Government, if those authorities were taken up, a great deal of clout in its relations with the Queensland Government in the matter of Aboriginal welfare and rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless one has actually seen and experienced the situation, it would be hard to credit that, in 1976, such oppression could be practised by the Queensland Government and its agencies against a section of its citizens; or that a State Government daily flouts two Federal laws, namely the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to draw the attention of the House to the Declaration of the Commonwealth on Racism and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Prejudice which was adopted by the Commonwealth heads of government at Lusaka on 7 August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We, the Commonwealth Heads of Government, recalling the declaration of Commonwealth principles made at Singapore on 22 January 197 1 and the statement on apartheid in sport, issued in London on 1 5 June 1977, have decided to proclaim our desire to work jointly as well as severally for the eradication of all forms of racism and <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth is an institution devoted to the promotion of international understanding and world peace, and to the achievement of equal rights for all citizens regardless of race, colour, sex, creed or political belief, and is committed to the eradication of the dangerous evils of racism and <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice, <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We now, therefore, proclaim this Lusaka Declaration of the Commonwealth on Racism and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Prejudice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>United in our desire to rid the world of the evils of racism and <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice, we proclaim our faith in the inherent dignity and worth of the human person and declare that: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While everyone is free to retain diversity in his or her culture and lifestyle, this diversity does not justify the prepetuation of <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice or racially discriminatory practices, <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We reject as inhuman and intolerable all policies designed to perpetuate apartheid, <span class="highlight">racial</span> segregation or other policies based on theories that <span class="highlight">racial</span> groups are or may be inherently superior or inferior. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We recognise that the effects of colonialism or racism in the past may make desirable special provisions for the social and economic enhancement of indigenous populations inspired by the principles of freedom and equality which characterise our association, we accept the solemn duty of working together to eliminate racism and <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Being aware that legislation alone cannot eliminate racism and <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice, we endorse the need to initiate public information and education policies designed to promote understanding, tolerance, respect and friendship among peoples and <span class="highlight">racial</span> groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are particularly conscious of the importance of the contribution the media can make to human rights and the eradication of racism and <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice by helping to eliminate ignorance and misunderstanding between people and by drawing attention to the evils which afflict humanity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In accordance with established principles of international law and, in particular, the provisions of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination, we affirm that everyone is, at all times and in all places, entitled to be protected in the enjoyment of the right to be free of racism and <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as the white community of that country is concerned, it can hope for a stable and peaceful existence, only as part of a genuine multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Zambia, they said, was a genuine multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span> society without tension, without conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian-born population has shown itself to be remarkably adaptable by progressively accepting many of the cultural values the newcomers have offered this nation, without significant <span class="highlight">racial</span> antagonisms and tensions which have marred life in some other nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, it has been a longstanding policy of Australian governments to oppose the importation into Australia of alien political and <span class="highlight">racial</span> feuds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time Australia indicated that it was ready to deal with the non-aligned and with Asia and Africa on their own terms, without <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in immigration policy and without overriding military preoccupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What members of the Opposition call being mute on issues of principle and what they call being servile is, in fact, being independent and ensuring that responsible guidelines are adhered to so that we do not have, for example, <span class="highlight">racial</span> inflammation on the radio, improper political attacks and the types of scurrilous abuses of privilege that we have heard today from the Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, there is a federal law which deals with <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and <span class="highlight">racial</span> hatred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that examples have been given and I think the honourable member for Lilley  (Mr Kevin Cairns)  picked a good one, of how people can promote hatred between people of different <span class="highlight">racial</span> or religious backgrounds- we have seen it in some countries of the world and we do not want it here- to such a degree that the peace, order or good government of a country can be endangered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the face of it, this would appear to be a breach of section 14 of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act which states, amongst other things: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, on the face of it, there does appear to be a breach of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will be taking the matter up with the Attorney-General for him to communicate with the Commissioner for Community Relations to see whether there has been a breach of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But, worse than this, he is attempting to disguise the <span class="highlight">racial</span> bias of the NUMAS selection procedure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was there any definition of their <span class="highlight">racial</span>, geographic or representational status on either their passports or other travel documents; if so, what was the definition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-47-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To this end we propose part (e) of the Opposition amendment which states that we should redraft the legislation to: enable the Institute of Multicultural Affairs to conduct research into and foster community sensitivity for <span class="highlight">racial</span> groups not the subject of study by the Institute of Aboriginal Studies - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It further states that the Institute ought to be enabled to conduct research into and foster community sensitivity for <span class="highlight">racial</span> groups not the subject of study by the Institute of Aboriginal Studies while including the latter in the ambit of multicultural affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It smacks of a sort of <span class="highlight">racial</span> intolerance on the part of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
