<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Does not this attitude of the South African Government reflect the direct interference in sport on <span class="highlight">racial</span> grounds which the Minister condemned in the Senate yesterday? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the General Assembly of the United Nations has designated 1971 as the International Year for Action to Combat Racism and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination will the Government make an early statement on whether it will actively support this decision, which would be in line with Australia’s subscription to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do any laws of the Commonwealth, in any way, contain elements of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That leave bc given to introduce a Bill for an Act relating to the Elimination of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> and Other Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill for an Act relating to the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> and other discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in its worst form when an Aboriginal senator is discriminated against to that extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pursuant to leave granted on 23 October I present a Bill for an Act relating to the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> and other discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs whether he has sighted a copy of a report on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination prepared by social work students at Sydney University. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2 <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill 1974 (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the issue is one of great sensitivity and because it involves legal matters, social matters of very wide import, and human relations, the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill requires a great deal of examination and requires of all of us a considerable amount of thought and selfexamination as we endeavour to make a contribution to the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Matters of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, matters of social equality and matters of social inequality are what I would describe as popular issues today insofar as society, in endeavouring to find new ways in which mankind may express itself, has decided that these issues shall be the subject of seminars and conferences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs been drawn to the adoption by the Third Committee of the United Nations of a resolution that Zionism is a form of racism and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was appointed in accordance with the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1 975 on 3 1 October 1 975 for a period of seven years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pursuant to section 46 of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975, I present the first annual report of the Commissioner for Community Relations for the year ended 30 June 1976, together with the text of a statement by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs relating to that report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-68">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  indicate at this point what funding will be available for the Community Relations Office, the establishment of which was provided for in the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Federal Government support the abolition of the Aborigines Act (Queensland) 1 97 1 , and the Torres Strait Islanders Act (Queensland) 1971 and take such action as they deem necessary to ensure that the provisions of the Queensland Discriminating Laws Act, 1975 and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act, 1975 be enforced in so far as they relate to Aborigines and Islanders; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pursuant to section 46 of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975 I present the annual report of the Commissioner for Community Relations for the year ended 30 June 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Information about the total number of Aboriginal students enrolled in these courses is not available to me, since institutions do not generally keep enrolment statistics on the basis of <span class="highlight">racial</span> origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pursuant to section 46 of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975,I present the report of the Commissioner for Community Relations 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had been ratified when the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act was passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination had then been ratified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply indicate at this Committee stage of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill that the Opposition’s attitude is one of complete opposition to every substantive provision in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question is that the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill 1 979 be now read a third time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The seeds of <span class="highlight">racial</span> violence are a real thing, because of the association of all these Aboriginal people in homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This can lead to <span class="highlight">racial</span> violence, and it is a matter about which we all must be concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 4 and except when the safety of the aircraft or of persons or property on board so requires, no provision of this Convention shall be interpreted as authorising or requiring any action in respect of offences against penal laws of a political nature or those based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> or religious discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 4 and except when the safety of the aircraft or of persons or property on board so requires, no provision of this Convention shall be interpreted as authorising or requiring any action in respect of offences against penal laws of a political nature or those based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> or religious discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Article 2 re-states a long-standing practice and international rules relating to extradition, that is, that there will be no extradition for political offences or offences arising from <span class="highlight">racial</span> or religious factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Keeffe has made some serious accusations of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination against the Division, which the Minister has denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700407_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is discrimination, first of all on a <span class="highlight">racial</span> basis and secondly because the War Service Homes Division is developing into a national scandal and it will be abolished within the lifetime of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700407_senate_27_s43/#debate-101">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Applicants for assistance are not, therefore, required to provide in their applications details of their <span class="highlight">racial</span> or national origin, and in these circumstances it is impracticable to indicate the number of persons of Aboriginal descent who have made successful applications for assistance under the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination policies of the South African Government in the sporting field, will the Australian Government indicate immediately its opposition to such a tour and advise the Australian Cricket Board of Control accordingly? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700519_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: Is Australia a signatory to a United Nations Article which states, among other things, that the signatory nations shall do all in their power to promote energetic action which, by combining with legal and other practical measures, will make possible the abolition of all forms of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We as a nation will face the same fiasco as England would have faced if we continue to play competitive sport with a country that is using the most vicious form of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination against the indigenous and other coloured people who live within that nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no room for racism of this sort in international sport, which ideally provides a way for men to meet and test each other on their merits, without the intrusion of politics or <span class="highlight">racial</span> inequality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is Australia a signatory to a United Nations Treaty which, in one Article, states that signatory nations ‘shall do all in our power to promote energetic action which, by combining legal and other practical measures, will make possible the abolition of all forms of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination’; if so, how does the Government reconcile agreement with this article with the growing trade wilh South Africa, which in 1969 reached a total of $65. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator’s quotation is from Article 10 of the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Oh, but the Leader of the Opposition tries to imply in this chamber and to tell the people of Australia that we have not accepted Gregory because there was a <span class="highlight">racial</span> situation, because this man was of coloured skin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether we like it or not, it is a plain fact of life that the siphoning off of an excessive amount of money for expenditure in South East Asia has contributed to the inability of the United States Treasury to meet some of the urban problems that have <span class="highlight">racial</span> overtones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But 1 did not ever hear them complain when Sergeant Gamboa was being kept out because of his <span class="highlight">racial</span> origin, and I did not ever hear them complain when  Mrs O’Reilly  was being kept out because of the white Australia policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know that, because of the communal problem that they have and because of a certain inbuilt communal instability due to <span class="highlight">racial</span> differences, they are quite vulnerable to that type of subversion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While his speech contained <span class="highlight">racial</span> overtones when he referred to the position in the United States, he was implying that we were creating slums for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the first time in my recollection that we have had a clear-cut statement of policy from the Minister on this matter and it disturbs me greatly to see that it is no longer based on economics but is a clear case of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this means that if they have a family, this stigma of <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice is passed on to the children of that family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear from the answers given by the Minister today that it is determined purely on a <span class="highlight">racial</span> basis.In my view it is entirely immoral in every respect and 1 want to voice my protest not only in relation to the specific case 1 have mentioned but also in relation to all persons who find themselves in a similar position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has claimed frequently that  its  immigration policy is not based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as 1 am concerned this man has been excluded from this country on a purely <span class="highlight">racial</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The spirit of the Australian people is not <span class="highlight">racial</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I object to members of the Opposition trying to pin a <span class="highlight">racial</span> policy onto the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>believe that this is not the spirit of the Australian people at all, irrespective of whether honourable senators in this chamber are influenced by <span class="highlight">racial</span> discriminations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer by the Minister to my question is clear: it is a matter of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know what the Minister will say in reply but I object most strongly to the accusation that the Government is involved in <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And I object to the fact that for sheer short term political advantage an accusation of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination has been thrown at this Government  when  the same policy would be followed by those people who are responsible for the policies of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I rose to object to were the many statements made both by  Senator Poyser  and  Senator Keeffe  which suggests that Australia is practising <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, and there is no other way to describe it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be an odd case where the Government would extend the provision, but no-one can deny that this is <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No-one could say that the case we are considering now is not one of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister may not be aware that in some sections of the mining complex <span class="highlight">racial</span> bias is practised to a fairly high degree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Their argument always is that the Territory is not ready  for  self-government, but that is an attitude typical of colonial powers and  it  smacks very much of <span class="highlight">racial</span> superiority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all know that often when economic changes occur and caution is suggested it is not suggested on a <span class="highlight">racial</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the question in view of the remarks made at today’s luncheon and also in view of the recent statement made by the Prime Minister that he and his Government abhor racism and that the Government is giving $12,000 to a national committee being established to combat racism and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710331_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I again ask in this year which is set aside to combat <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination: What is being done by the Government to ensure that proper wages and conditions are received by our Aboriginal people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710331_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: Will the Government prevail on the Australian cricket authorities to scrap the tour unless these coloured cricketers are allowed to join the team, and so alleviate the undoubted tension which is rapidly building up in this country in protest against <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in South Africa? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware of the strong fears expressed by many Malaysian graduates of Chinese origin resident in Australia that due to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination practised by the Malaysian Government in favour of citizens of Malayan origin as against those of Chinese origin, the latter have little chance of job placement in Malaysia commensurate with the professional qualifications acquired in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710420_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On close examination, history has been biased and at times falsified for the purpose of elevating one <span class="highlight">racial</span> group at the expense of another and has given a one-sided view of the development of nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This decision is appropriate if it is made on industrial issues, but they cannot expect to have a cohesive organisation following their decisions if those decisions are made for purposes for which they are not constituted, namely, political, <span class="highlight">racial</span>, religious or other purposes that are foreign to industrial issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that we should establish a Commonwealth ministry for physical culture, sport and recreation, the responsibilities of which would include, firstly, making grants to States to ensure adequate facilities for all physical culture and sports programmes; secondly, making grants to States to ensure that national fitness councils are provided with adequate finance for promoting physical fitness campaigns; thirdly, making grants to State and national physical culture groups and sporting teams where such assistance is deemed to be in the general interest of the nation; and, fourthly, arranging the interchange of physical culture groups and sporting teams between Australia and other countries where such groups or teams are selected on other than a <span class="highlight">racial</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-55-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What action to combat racism and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination has been taken or is intended to be taken during 1971 by the Australian Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a statement to the press on 22nd March, 1971, the Prime Minister announced that Australia subscribed fully to the purpose of this Year which is to achieve significant progress in eliminating all forms and manifestations of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As part of the programme to observe the Year, the General Assembly of the United Nations recommended to all governments that they should make as one of their objectives the signature and ratification of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Smaller nations like Australia should take warning: They, too,  are  clearly expendable on the altars of bigpower convenience and of African and Asian <span class="highlight">racial</span> hatreds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If some Aborigines are in the category of low income earners (hey should be considered on their merits and in no way associated with their <span class="highlight">racial</span> background. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether the children attend a State school or an independent school, whether they happen to have a particular <span class="highlight">racial</span> background, to have been born in this country or to have come here as migrants, they are still Australian children and should be considered as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">racial</span> ground involved, because she is English and her husband was Portuguese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of a strange twist of fate - because of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination against him in the West Indies - he could not successfully follow his trade and successfully conduct a business in partnership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The then Minister,  Mr Lynch,  gave me a written reply which clearly indicated that the decision was based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has been established - this is my advice, and I accept the advice - that through the intervention of the Ford Motor Company on this man’s behalf he was granted an assisted passage, although he did not comply with the hard line policy which the Government now has on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in mixed marriages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is not finding any <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination within his employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He suggested that the policy which is being applied with regard to assisted passages is an inhuman policy and a policy which savours of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second matter 1 wish to raise is the question of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To round off, I am still not satisfied that we are allowing to return to Australia all the Asian graduates from our universities who can prove that for <span class="highlight">racial</span> reasons they are not being given the status to which they are entitled in Malaysia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I charged - and 1 repeat what I said on that occasion - that in my view and in the view of many people this policy is a <span class="highlight">racial</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 cannot understand the Government saying that this was not done on a <span class="highlight">racial</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously it must be on a <span class="highlight">racial</span> basis when one receives a reply like that and finds that this is the general position but that there is some flexibility if the right people can apply pressure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that  Senator Poyser  helps the nation by categorisingthat policy as a <span class="highlight">racial</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He does not care what divisions might be created in Australia if he can make some political advantage by categorising the Government’s policy as <span class="highlight">racial</span>, when for all the years that that policy has been developing it has been supported by his own Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are too many examples throughout the world of <span class="highlight">racial</span> division and misfortune, killing and disunity flowing from a migration policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However I do not believe we will be free of it if every time the opportunity arises there is a carping, harping allegation that the Government is adopting a <span class="highlight">racial</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who allege racialism in areas where theoretically they might be able to establish a point which does not exist in practice create the problems that supposedly they are criticising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the Labor Party seeks to criticise the Government and accuse it of having a <span class="highlight">racial</span> policy I think it is fair for mc to say to the Labor Party: Tell the people of Australia where you stand on these issues and let them make any judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am amazed at the double standards that can be adopted by the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  and at his general <span class="highlight">racial</span> attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government has a <span class="highlight">racial</span> policy so far as mixed marriages are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true, as  Senator Poyser  has said, that this Government through its immigration policies has consistently exercised a <span class="highlight">racial</span> bias over a long period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is complete <span class="highlight">racial</span> tolerance when the Government, as I have said on so many occasion, sells Australian minerals at bargain basement prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said a little while ago, the only way in which the Government displays <span class="highlight">racial</span> tolerance is by selling out Australia to nonwhite countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are 3 major cases involving <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It arose because  Senator Poyser,  a member of the Austraiian Labor Party, accused the Government of having an immigration policy which was based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1, as the person representing the Minister for Immigration  (Dr Forbes)  denied that we had a <span class="highlight">racial</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I denied that we had a policy which would properly be described as a policy based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said quite fairly - this was before the suspension of the sitting for dinner - that if the Labor Party and  Senator Poyser  say that the Government has a <span class="highlight">racial</span> policy what would the Australian Labor Party do in a comparable situation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we are talking about the question of coloured immigration - you talked about homogeneity in Australia - would you explain to me why the former Prime Minister,  Mr Gorton,  when he was in Singapore, which is a very receptive place to make this sort of statement, said that we were moving towards a multiracial nation in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Being shown those figures  Mr Gorton  believed that the Liberal’ Parly was moving surreptitiously towards a multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span> nation in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was merely an announcement made in 1966 by the then Minister for Immigration that there would be some changes that we would not be so <span class="highlight">racial</span> in the future, and everybody applauded that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today, if an Australian goes to New Zealand to visit or to live, whatever his <span class="highlight">racial</span> background - whether he be of Chinese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Included in those grounds will be whether the applicant has relatives in this country, whether he has a skill that we require and whether we have too many of that <span class="highlight">racial</span> origin coming in at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we adopt that policy I believe that we are entitled to say that we are not following a <span class="highlight">racial</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a policy which should be categorised as <span class="highlight">racial</span>, because it is the kind of policy which most countries follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point which I feel the Government is being assailed upon and which I initially rose to defend is that we are adopting a <span class="highlight">racial</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Poyser  said that we are maintaining a <span class="highlight">racial</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know that no matter what the situation is there shall be no <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and, therefore, any person from another country who wants to migrate here shall not be denied entry because to do so would be to involve him in <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are issues which I have raised only because - let this be quite understood - at an earlier stage in the debate  Senator Poyser  accused the Government of having a <span class="highlight">racial</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There shall be no <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President,  as I do not know how closely you have followed the debate this afternoon and evening on the estimates for the Department of Immigration, I think I should indicate that everything seemed to go along smoothly until just prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner, which is when SenatorPoyser brought up the question of whether there was <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination against a particular type of migrant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>116 septics have been installed, with a further 3 about to be installed, without identification as to the <span class="highlight">racial</span> origin of the people for whom they have been provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I am making is that if we of the Labor Party and the trade union movement begin to question the number of migrants coming in it is because we do not want to see any <span class="highlight">racial</span> bitterness or undue competition between A and B for a particular job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a problem of cultural deprivation, and all ‘Aboriginal’ or ‘<span class="highlight">racial</span>’ problems are essentially this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, <span class="highlight">racial</span> or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Procedures for the employment of persons by the Commonwealth provide that persons who are otherwise suitable and eligible for employment are not discriminated against on <span class="highlight">racial</span> grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Employers are under no legal obligation to offer equal employment opportunities to people regardless of <span class="highlight">racial</span> origins but any complaints of discrimination in employment are investigated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Poverty is bad enough, but poverty combined with <span class="highlight">racial</span> or colour differences is socially, divisive and may in the long run prove disastrous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The section has been inoperative for some time, and, in accordance with the Government’s policy of eliminating any potential source of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, is being repealed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the state of Aboriginal rights, health, infant mortality, life expectancy, education, training, employment, ownership, movement and democratic political advancement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Peoples everywhere in Australia is unequal compared with people of European origin, whether migrating to or bom in Australia; and this constitutes a challenge to the Australian people on grounds of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, racism and even forms of genocide; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs: With the current proposed expulsion of Asians from Uganda and the previous expulsion of many Asians from Zambia by devious means, will the Australian Government give support to any proposed United Nations sanctions against such blatant acts of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the AttorneyGeneral: Having in mind the blatant acts of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination by Uganda against Asians, will the Australian Government give an assurance that any sporting team from Uganda visiting this country will be given protection against <span class="highlight">racial</span> demonstrators in an endeavour to avoid another Springbok demonstration and clearly show that the Government and great majority of people in Australia will not accept the mixing of politics with sport? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me make it clear that that team was selected on the basis of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a basic weakness in the actual policy of this Government - the Government you support,  Mr Acting Deputy President  - in the way in which it has violated on <span class="highlight">racial</span> grounds, I contend, those last 2 clauses of the United Nations Charter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Bonner, unlike some others, does not distinguish between races in the way in which some members of the Labor Party are prepared to adopt a <span class="highlight">racial</span> approach to their attitudes in relation to these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I deplore the introduction of a <span class="highlight">racial</span> approach to the problems of the people of Australia, whatever the colour of the skin of those people may be or whatever their origins may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, I have taken part in protests and demonstrations in support of <span class="highlight">racial</span> tolerance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have taken part in demonstrations that were opposed to racialism because my attitude has always been that racialism is the lowest form, the most despicable form of human altitude, lt offends me for  Senator Bonner  to say that I would incite anyone - let alone an Aborigine - to an act of violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part of the reason for that being done was to enable people in this group to have the situation which they had created paraded throughout the world as an indication of what they regarded as the Government’s <span class="highlight">racial</span> attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore to those who have suggested that in this form of protest they should be accorded a solicitude and a tolerance which is denied to other sections of the community who similarly want to protest on issues which are relevant to their interests in life, I say that once they do that they are putting the Aborigines in a position different from that of the rest of the community; they are contradicting the whole of their thesis on <span class="highlight">racial</span> integration, they are contradicting the whole of their thesis on toleration and the whole of their thesis on the ultimate integration of the Aboriginal people with the white culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The measures that have been adopted in relation to the solution of it are measures which excite the regret and disapproval of all governments that oppose <span class="highlight">racial</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nobody who comes from England - from Cornwall in particular - can boast of purity of <span class="highlight">racial</span> heritage if one analyses the situation of the British Isles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amongst our Australian Aboriginal community today, as we refer to it, are many people of much purer <span class="highlight">racial</span> strain than any of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although this legislation applies to a relatively small number of persons,  Mr President,  as approximately 760 Torres Strait Islanders and 40 mainland Aboriginals served during World War II in the Torres Strait Light Infantry Forces, it is nevertheless important as another move in the Commonwealth’s avowed intention to remove the last remnants of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination from the statute books. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people of these islands are of entirely different character, <span class="highlight">racial</span> background and culture from that of the people of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill which I now introduce to the House is designed to make changes to the Migration Act which are necessary as part of the Government’s policy to remove all forms of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With a view to ratification of the International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination it is necessary that this legislative provision, which is discriminatory on <span class="highlight">racial</span> grounds, be removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The action of the Government in making the repeal of these discriminatory provisions one of its first legislative acts is a token of our determination to banish <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination within our community and is also a step towards building on equal terms the family of the nation in citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy of the new Government is to eliminate all forms of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it has been announced already that legislation will be introduced into this Parliament to implement the international convention on the elimination of all forms of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I conceive  it,  it will be possible, pursuant to that legislation, for this Parliament to insist that any form of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination be eliminated in Australia, whether such discrimination be by the Federal Government and its agencies or by State governments and their agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that we will be able to legislate generally to forbid the pactice of any form of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today it might be thought that the Senate is passing this Bill to remove some <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination against Aborigines whereas, if I understand the history of the Bill correctly, it was introduced originally to protect Aborigines against exploitation by the white man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We most certainly are opposed to all forms of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By and large, they are an industrious, law abiding community with an exceptionally good record of <span class="highlight">racial</span> harmony. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The signatories include people like Ivan Kosovich of Yagoona, a man who, when it comes to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, experienced it on the Western Australian gold fields in the 1930s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they do so, they will be doing a disservice to <span class="highlight">racial</span> relations in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Industrial relations in the Territory frequently have <span class="highlight">racial</span> ramifications, since most employers are expatriates and most employees are indigenes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the other 2 amendments adopted in 1964, one provided for the suspension from participation in the International Labour Conference of any ILO member State which had been found by the United Nations to be flagrantly and persistently pursuing by its legislation a declared policy of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination such as apartheid and the other for the expulsion from the ILO or suspension from the exercise of the rights and privileges of membership of the ILO of any member which the United Nations had suspended from the exercise of the rights and privileges of membership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the Government proposes to ratify them to demonstrate Australia’s firm opposition to all forms of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination such as apartheid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 20 March, on the occasion of the international day for the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, I reaffirmed our intention to ratify the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination as soon as the necessary legislative and other measures could be completed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our decision to deny racially selected sports teams the right to visit or transit Australia should also be seen in this light. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Schedule 4 and 5, also adopted in July 1964, provide for the suspension from participation in the ILO of any nation pursuing a policy of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One may wonder whether the purposes of avoiding <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination really are achieved by expelling from the Organisation where influences may prevail bodies which do not measure up to the standards of ILO, but that is academic at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has indicated that it wants to adopt this convention to indicate its position in regard to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and that position is supported by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the present Government, when it was in Opposition, sought to denigrate the Ordinance and the Government’s actions and motives in relation to it on the basis that the Ordinance represented some <span class="highlight">racial</span> bias or some <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can he inform the Senate whether this legislation is aimed at implementing the provisions of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination which was never done by this Government ‘s predecessors? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is intended to implement the provisions of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination, and legislation has been prepared to do this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not long ago- in fact, it has happened repeatedly- a meeting of Commonwealth countries was held in Singapore and was attended by the British Prime Minister,  Mr Edward  Heath, and other leaders of varying ideological or <span class="highlight">racial</span> content. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration, concerns the ban which has been placed on the Rhodesian delegates of mixed <span class="highlight">racial</span> origin who wish to attend the fourteenth triennial conference of the Associated Country Women of the World which is to be held in Perth in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Considering the fact that after a thorough investigation by the United Nations the Associated Country Women of the World still retains its status with that organisation and works in close harmony with its specialised agencies, does the Government’s refusal to allow the mixed <span class="highlight">racial</span> Rhodesian delegates to the conference to enter Australia contravene the United Nations General Assembly’s resolution of approval? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, <span class="highlight">racial</span> or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill proposes that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination should be made unlawful in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination was adopted by the United Nations in 1965. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Convention recognises that any doctrine of superiority based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and without any justification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United Nations has placed high priority on the advancement of measures for the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in its human rights program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently, the General Assembly of the United Nations approved a program for the observance of 1 97 1 as the International Year for Action to Combat Racism and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The vigorous action initiated by the United Nations in 1971 was followed up in November 1972 by a resolution of the General Assembly in which it was decided to launch a Decade for Action to Combat Racism and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination and to inaugurate these activities on 10 December 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Initiative was taken in 1971 by the United Nations Association of Australia which set up a Committee to Combat Racism and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The volumes edited by  Mr F.  S. Stevens constitute a valuable contribution to the study of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the most blatant example of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia is that which affects Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination does, in fact, recognise the need to take special and concrete measures to ensure the adequate development of certain <span class="highlight">racial</span> groups for the purpose of guaranteeing them the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the Bill gives recognition to this need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic scheme of the Bill is to condemn <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination as being unlawful and to provide machinery for investigation and conciliation as well as legal sanctions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proscribing of acts of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination will have an important persuasive and educative effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is unlawful will make it easier for people to resist social pressures that result in discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concept of conciliation in the settlement of differences between <span class="highlight">racial</span> groups is one that has wide acceptance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, positive and lasting solutions to the problems created by <span class="highlight">racial</span> tensions are often best achieved by the conciliation process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill is divided into 7 parts, the first dealing with preliminary matters, the second with the prohibition of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, the third with investigations and civil proceedings, the fourth with offences, the fifth with the Race Relations Council, the sixth dealing with administrative provisions and the seventh with miscellaneous matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part II of the Bill deals with the prohibition of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This provision follows closely the definition ‘<span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination’ in the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are also offences relating to incitement of <span class="highlight">racial</span> disharmony, the dissemination of ideas based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> superiority or hatred with intent to promote hostility or ill will and the incitement of acts of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is a first, but essential, step in providing measures for the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia and for the guarantee of rights without discrimination on grounds of race. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They must be accompanied by positive governmental programs designed to bridge the gaps that result in <span class="highlight">racial</span> tensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion I would emphasise that the purpose of the Bill is to carry out the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, <span class="highlight">racial</span> or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware of any other laws of the Commonwealth which contain elements of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it arbitrary and excessive power to introduce a Bill to outlaw <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, as a matter of policy, would not wish to interfere in the internal policies and administration of independent bodies such as residential college councils, except where there was some breach of federal law, for example on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and other fundamental human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the Attorney-General that when we find similar provisions to these in his <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill and in his Human Rights Bill- provisions which give this tremendous inquisitorial power to commissions to interfere with the rights of ordinary citizens- this is the forum and this is the Parliament in which a voice must be raised to object to that sort of thing being done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will have a significant jurisdiction in defining civil liberties under the Human Rights and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bills which are already before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable senator is suggesting that each advertisement should have contained each and everyone of the <span class="highlight">racial</span> and ethnic discriminations practised by the previous government touching on the people that he quaintly calls British subjects, then he would have had to take not a small advertisement but a full page advertisement in everyone of the papers concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to them that their intolerance can only add fuel to the fires that have been kindled by those who want to see <span class="highlight">racial</span> unrest in our wonderful nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Presumably, the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill will be reintroduced, but when does the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  expect that to be debated? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The standards obtained in the development of our society have been achieved without <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and without the problems that have beset other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill re-introduces, with improvements, the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill 1973, which was introduced into the Senate on 21 November 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Bill is to make <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination unlawful in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It implements into Australian law the obligations contained in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is recognised in this Convention that any doctrine of superiority based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and without any justification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As was the case with the 1973 Bill, machinery to enforce the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination forms an important part of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill sets out legal remedies that may be sought by an aggrieved person before the courts and offences of inciting <span class="highlight">racial</span> disharmony are created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Race Relations Council will be established to make recommendations on the action that should be taken to bring about the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the basis on which most discrimination is made against migrant people and the form of discrimination dealt with by the Convention against <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council’s role will encompass the areas of educational programs, the promotion of studies and research programs, the publication and dissemination of material to assist in the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and the promotion of understanding, tolerance and friendship among <span class="highlight">racial</span> or ethnic groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The changing of community attitudes and the promotion of understanding, tolerance and friendship among <span class="highlight">racial</span> or ethnic groups will form an extremely important part of the Government ‘s program for the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia must approach this problem with a sense of national unity to ensure that prejudice and racialism do not form any part of our national identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They must be accompanied by positive Government programs designed to bridge the gaps that result in <span class="highlight">racial</span> tension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proscribing of acts of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, will of itself, assist in reducing social pressures that result in discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other measures relating to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say that this is in no way associated with any acts which people seek to describe as <span class="highlight">racial</span> violence between one race and another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legislation will be re-introduced to permit Australia to ratify the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination, which came into force in  January  1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legislation will also be introduced to supersede certain provisions of the Queensland Aborigines Act and Torres Strait Islanders Act which are contrary to the principles embodied in the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Convention and in the International Covenant on Civil  and  Political <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are aghast that the Government of Australia should involve itself in furthering unrest and warfare between <span class="highlight">racial</span> groups on the continent of Africa and direct public funds to this end, and we request that senators take up this matter with the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Human Rights Bill and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill which will be introduced into the Parliament by the Government will, when passed, reinforce Australia’s compliance with the terms of the genocide convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet extraordinarily, looking at all this and looking at the <span class="highlight">racial</span> background, the Government rests on 2 things: ‘You people recognised Goa, and Sweden and Switzerland have come to the party’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam  said that  Mr Grassby  would be appointed commissioner under the <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination legislation when passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian criticism of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in South Africa, and the Government ‘s unofficial proposal to vote in the UN Security Council for the expulsion of South Africa, either choose to ignore facts that are being given wide publicity or to interpret them as gimmicks and window-dressing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts are increasing multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span> sport and some multiracial diplomatic staffs, official moves to gradually get away from colour discrimination, and preparations for the complete independence of the Bantu homelands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I interrupt my reading to say that I do not remember hearing any great criticism from our Minister for Foreign Affairs of the day when President Amin took some of his <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination to heart and proceeded to act in a reverse way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a country which has ranged through the problems of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can we in Australia say that we are trying to get rid of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and that we believe we should not judge one another because of the colour of our skins, yet turn round and vote the other way when it conies to South Africa? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are passing laws and establishing departments to assist and uplift and to get away from <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to make <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination unlawful in Australia and to provide an effective means of combating <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I introduced into the Senate a <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill on 21 November 1 973, and again on 4 April 1 974, but the Bill was not debated before Parliament was dissolved for the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill implements into Australian law the obligations contained in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is recognised in this Convention that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that any doctrine of superiority based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and without any justification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill recognises the importance of legislation that will make <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination unlawful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that the introduction of legislation to outlaw <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is a fundamental step that must be taken if Australia is to ratify the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legislation therefore has a vital role to play in the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proscribing of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in legislative form not only makes people more aware of the evils of discrimination and makes it more obvious and conspicuous, but also furnishes an essential legal background on which to base changes to basic community attitudes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is unlawful will make it easier for people to resist social pressures that result in discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In making <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination unlawful, the Bill follows closely the definition used in the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also deals in detail with <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination so far as it concerns access to places and facilities, the provision of land, housing and other accommodation, the provision of goods and services, the right to join trade unions and employment <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Bill establishes formal administrative machinery for the examination of complaints of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination on a systematic basis and for the settlement of complaints by conciliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also recognises that an emphasis on mediation and conciliation is a more satisfactory way of tackling individual instances of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and the tensions that are associated with individual disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also recognises the importance of developing programs of education and research and other programs to combat <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among <span class="highlight">racial</span> and ethnic groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commissioner will have the function of conducting programs of education and research to combat <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, and a Community Relations Council will be established with an advisory role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further change to the previous Bills effected by the present Bill will give the Commissioner the function of carrying out and fostering programs of education and research and other programs to combat <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overseas experience has shown that the success of legislation dealing with <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination depends very much on the effectiveness of programs of this kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my second reading speech of 4 April 1974, 1 pointed out that the changing of community attitudes and the promotion of understanding, tolerance and friendship among <span class="highlight">racial</span> and ethnic groups would form an extremely important part of government’s program for the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also pointed out that both government and community-based programs to combat <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination were necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia will be required by Article 7 of the Convention to conduct programs of this kind to combat <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, the Bill has been amended to emphasise reliance on civil, rather than criminal, law to combat <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill will provide the basis upon which Australia can comply with the obligations imposed by the Convention on <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation recognises that there must also be effective and systematic enforcement of rights and the promotion of education and research, if the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in this country is to be achieved in fact as well as in theory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill 1974 introduced by  Senator Murphy  is aimed at overcoming the differences between whites and Aborigines in some respects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs agree with  Mr Charles  Perkins that the head of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs should be sacked for <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in the administration of the Department? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Except for a few <span class="highlight">racial</span> minorities that exist around the country- there are 42 million people making up those <span class="highlight">racial</span> minorities but they represent only 6 per cent of the populationall religion in the socialist State is forbidden by law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination has been one of the major preoccupations of the international community since the Second World War. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination (1965), which was signed on behalf of Australia by the then Minister for External Affairs,  Mr Hasluck,  on 13 October 1966, and to which 81 countries have subscribed, requires countries to prohibit <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in all its forms and to guarantee equality before the law without distinction as to race. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United Nations has supplemented these instruments with numerous resolutions, conferences and programs designed to promote the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently, the United Nations designated 1971 as the International Year for Action to Combat Racism and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination, and vigorous programs for the year were conducted throughout the world, including Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 6 December 1971, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a resolution urging further ratifications of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Convention and this resolution was carried by 10 1 voting in favourincluding Australia- none against and 5 abstentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 10 December 1973, the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination was inaugurated by the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The program proposed by the United Nations for action on the national level during the decade includes the introduction of legislation, where appropriate, to prevent <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against this background, it has been the conscious policy of both Liberal and Labor governments to eliminate all legislation in Australia that contains elements of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1971 the United Nations Association of Australia set up an Australian Committee to Combat Racism and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination, as part ofthe United Nations program for the year that I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its report of its activities of the year, the Committee stated that during the year it had repeatedly urged the Australian and State Governments to repeal all legislation of a discriminatory nature and to take all necessary steps to ratify the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You may be assured, however, that the Government is continuing its efforts to end all forms of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As no action has been taken by the Queensland Government on these matters, provisions were included in the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill 1973 to supersede the Queensland law that authorised the management of the property of Aboriginals and Islanders without their consent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Act is not designed as an instrument of <span class="highlight">racial</span> supremacy, bigotry, hatred or discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far from being an act of discrimination against Aborigines, the Queensland Act discriminates in favour of them, which is in accord with the Schedule of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Special measures taken for the sole purpose of securing adequate advancement of certain <span class="highlight">racial</span> or ethnic groups or individuals requiring such protection as may be necessary in order to ensure such groups or individuals equal enjoyment or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms shall not be deemed <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination provided, however, that such measures do not as a consequence lead to the maintenance of separate rights for different <span class="highlight">racial</span> groups and that they shall not be continued after the objectives for which they were taken have been achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet this dauntless disciple of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, with his Department divided, his radicals ridiculing him and the children under his care starving, presumes to discredit Queensland’s Aborigines and Islanders, the Queensland legislation and the Queensland Premier with a Bill that is nothing more than deceit and duplicity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions in respect of the management of property that are discriminatory against Aborigines or Islanders are contrary to the provisions of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is very little difference between the forms of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We propose to take action by supporting the Attorney-General’s <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination Bill which will make illegal the refusal to let premises to a person simply because of his Aboriginality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs seen an article in the ‘Sydney Morning Herald ‘ last Saturday to the effect that descendants of Pacific islanders brought to Australia as slave labour last century are planning an appeal to the United Nations against what they allege is <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination by Federal and State governments in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we know the features of poverty in other groups, if we take into account income, housing conditions, loss of freedom and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination it is clear that Aboriginals are worse off in Queensland than in other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has he heard radio news reports this morning that an Aboriginal required treatment -at Alice Springs after being painted from head to toe with white paint by a group of men, and of other incidents of <span class="highlight">racial</span> violence between whites and blacks in the town? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the recess when I went to Alice Springs to see whether I could assist in any way in relation to the <span class="highlight">racial</span> tension in the town a plea was made by a number of citizens that it should be cleaned up urgently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to make <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination unlawful in Australia and to provide an effective means of combating <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice in our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation will implement into Australian law the obligations contained in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is asserted in this Convention that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that any doctrine of superiority based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and without any justification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legislation has a vital role to play in the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and the enactment of this Bill is a fundamental step that must be taken if Australia is to ratify the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proscribing of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in legislative form will make people more aware of the evils of discrimination and will also make it more obvious and conspicuous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is unlawful will make it easier for people to resist social pressures that result in discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It also deals in detail with <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination so far as it concerns access to places and facilities, the provision of land, housing and other accommodation, the provision of goods and services and the right to join trade unions and employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the Bill, the Commissioner will have the function of conducting and fostering programs of education and research to combat <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, and a Community Relations Council will be established with an advisory role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will provide the basis upon which Australia can comply with the obligations imposed by the Convention on <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister examine this matter and advise whether such practices would be in conflict with the proposed <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 13 of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill which, I think, has reached the second reading stage in the Senate, provides - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Will the proposed Australian Government insurance office be using <span class="highlight">racial</span> origin as a criterion for deciding who will be offered insurance policies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have also seen a statement which is attributed to a  Mr Sharpies,  a spokesman of the Prudential Assurance Co. Ltd., who said that all insurance companies take account of the <span class="highlight">racial</span> origins of people in the provision of life assurance policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure this will be reflected in his attitude to the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill and other legislation which comes before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure all honourable senators that the Australian Government insurance office will see that there will be no <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in the provision of policies for any resident of this country who applies for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his statement  Mr Sharpies  said that the clauses which referred to <span class="highlight">racial</span> origin were drawn up in 1969 and he went on to say: ‘They should not be in the book and they will not be there in the next reprint’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So apparently  Senator Baume  thinks that <span class="highlight">racial</span> restrictions ought to be applied which the spokesman for the Prudential Assurance Company has said should not be applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I say this: I do not believe the proper approach to questions of differences within society is on a <span class="highlight">racial</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can assure  Senator Baume  that so far as I am concerned there will be no restrictions based on the <span class="highlight">racial</span> origins of any person with regard to the granting of policies by the Australian Government insurance office, that any applications for policies made by any persons will be judged on the characteristics of the applicants themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware of the <span class="highlight">racial</span> discriminatory practices contained in a document known as ‘The Manual of Policy and Information’ of the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My attention has now been drawn to 2 life assurance offices which issued manuals which imposed <span class="highlight">racial</span> discriminatory provisions in the rules applying to the availability of life policies to people of various ethnic groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination Bill was first introduced in November 1973 and it was not presented to the Senate for debate prior to the Parliament being prorogued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A second <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination Bill was introduced in April 1974 and that again was not presented to the Senate for debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A third <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination Bill was presented in October 1974 and that was withdrawn from the Senate in February 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 15 April of this year this <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill was transmitted by message from the House of Representatives and today, after some 18 months, it comes before the Senate to be debated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has many reservations about the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It recognises that the Bill gives expression to a desirable and acceptable principle- the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Racial</span> discrimination which proceeds from or which seeks to develop a superiority concept is to be deplored and avoided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A society which is plagued by the tensions of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is likely to be a society torn by dissension and evidencing a developing instability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill of course ratifies the United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seeks to establish its principles by providing, in general provisions, that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination shall be unlawful and by providing, through particular provisions, that certain types of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination shall be unlawful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is recognised by the Opposition that if we are to cope with <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in a way that seeks to specify what are acts of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and to indicate a community disapproval of such conduct, then provisions of the character which are contained in the Bill are desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill of course indicates- it is a provision to which we take exception- that if an act which could be regarded as an act of discrimination occurs and the reason for that act of discrimination occurring has a number of facets to it of which only one is the intention to do an act of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, then that is still to be regarded as an unlawful act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an act of discrimination occurs it should be unlawful only if the dominant reason is discrimination on the grounds of <span class="highlight">racial</span> or ethnic origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it be said that one reason why civil proceedings are not the appropriate proceedings under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act is because of the delicacy of the human relations which are involved, one might draw by way of comparison the fact that that has been the type of argument which has been used to justify certain types of proceedings before conciliation commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first relates to the constitutional justification which might have been offered for this legislation; the second is to consider whether laws of this character can be expected to have the overall beneficial effects which can be claimed for legislation which deals with <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination; and the third is to specify a little more precisely why the Opposition will propose its type of enforcement in preference to that which the Government has suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a Bill which seeks to make unlawful conduct which may be described broadly as conduct involving <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no express power in the Constitution to make laws with respect to race relations or <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, or the conduct which may take place which is proscribed by this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Government is doing is relying upon the fact that there is an international convention for the elimination of all forms of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination which Australia is ratifying and which, because of the obligations which it is said flow from that ratification, enables it to exercise its powers to make laws with respect to external affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There also is an obligation upon a guarantor, a party to the convention, to declare as an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> superiority or hatred, or incitement to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It shall declare illegal and prohibit organisations which promote and incite <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I object to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination; I object to communism, to fascism and to other forms of totalitarianism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding that I object to communism, or fascism, or <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, I would recognise that it is the right of other people if they want to disseminate those views to be able to disseminate them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Convention proceeds, of course, on the basis that the propagation of any doctrine based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is scientifically false, is morally condemnable and socially unjust and that there is no justification for <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it has to be recognised today that there are few, if any, laws still remaining in this country which could be regarded as laws which involve a <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be recognised also that this legislation, if it were enacted in the form in which it is presented, would create a bureaucracy or inspection force which would feed upon detecting <span class="highlight">racial</span> incidents and bringing them before the Commissioner or before the courts for settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was said that the legislation has a vital role to play in the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proscribing of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in legislative form will make people more aware of the evils of discrimination and will make it more obvious and conspicuous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that that will be a consequence of the Bill, but whether that will aid in the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is very much open to question, because the more there is a concentration and a focusing of attention on an issue which to many people has never been an issue at all, the more it will create problems which never before were problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is unlawful will make it easier for people to resist social pressures that result in discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that people desire to observe the law, and if they know it is unlawful to engage in acts of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination then I think there will be a tendency and a willingness to accept that that is a conformity which they must respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that in the United Kingdom where the <span class="highlight">racial</span> tensions have a far greater recognition than in Australia there has been legislation designed to avoid <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination since, I think, 1966. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the commentaries in the news reports, one realises that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is as great and as much a source of friction in the United Kingdom today as it ever was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other publication to which I refer is ‘The Extent of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the real problems in our society- not so much in Australia as in other countries- is that <span class="highlight">racial</span> disharmony can poison the stability of a community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in Australia have been singularly free of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is only in recent times that we have had instances in which <span class="highlight">racial</span> disharmony and racism have been highlighted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the concept in this Bill-  which is inherent in the International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination becomes continually more and more plainly correct and it will be a notable day when this country of ours can join those who have ratified the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Greenwood  said also that this Bill would declare illegal organisations which foster <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a great need to declare illegal those organisations which foster <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Greenwood  spoke of the previous <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind  Senator Wright,  who is trying to interject, that Aboriginal women are included in the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know what her colour was and I do not know what her <span class="highlight">racial</span> origin was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination that we are specifically looking at today is just as apparent in many other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have all read reports of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, and some of us have been fortunate enough, or unfortunate enough, to see instances of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Estes  who has since returned to the U.S., said before he left that he was shocked by the <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice he met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Greenwood mentioned earlier that the Convention would declare illegal organisations which foster <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think honourable senators should give a few moments thought to the background of the matter before the Senate, which is the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-We are discussing the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill 1975 but after hearing that speech by  Senator Coleman  we could be forgiven for falling into some confusion because for all we know it could have been a discussion on a Bill on discrimination on the grounds of sex, income level, drugs, family power- anything but <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No country on earth has solved the problem of inter-<span class="highlight">racial</span> relations especially when those races are living side by side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Forced segregation has been tried, for example, in South Africa and Rhodesia and it has led those countries into international ostracism, unjustifiably in my opinion because the multiracial and multinational problems in South Africa appear to me to be of much less magnitude than they are in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Problems of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination do not occur in the socialist countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That country does not have <span class="highlight">racial</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those countries are not subject to the same problems in <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination as we are here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of these problems, once again created by governments, we are now faced with this <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is being brought in on the grounds that Australia is a party to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The introduction of the Bill is supported by the Schedule of the International Con vention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination, and claims that the charter of the United Nations is based on the dignity and equality inherent in all human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far from eliminating <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination by making it illegal, the Bill will highlight the problems between the races and create an official race relations industry with a staff of dedicated anti-racists earning their living by making the most of every complaint in much the same way as does the Race Relations Board in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is somewhat incongruous that we find the Opposition parties criticising this Government which outlined in its policy speech- it also is in the program of the Australian Labor Party- its determination to play a significant part in abolishing any forms of <span class="highlight">racial</span>, political and economic discrimination in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill sets out very simply to ratify an international convention to make it unlawful for any person to practice <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is seeking to introduce legislation designed to meet Australia’s obligations under the international convention on the elimination of all forms of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can quote no better authority on the question of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination than the founder of the Australian Liberal Party,  Sir Robert  Menzies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any doctrine of superiority based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust, dangerous and without any justification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody can disagree, surely, with the proposition that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination continues to flourish in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague,  Senator Coleman,  has given abundant evidence that this form of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination exists very far and very wide in our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is required are strong, operable, measures designed to eliminate <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in order that a more free and equal Australian society can emerge from the scourge of prejudice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It recognises also that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination cannot be curbed solely by legal means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is concerned with research programs and studies in order to achieve understanding about human relations, to achieve understanding about human beings, to achieve tolerance and friendship among all people living in Australia regardless of <span class="highlight">racial</span> and ethnic differences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am grateful for the small mercy that at least  Mr W.  C. Wentworth in another place said that he would support that portion of the legislation which seeks to implement the Convention and to carry out a program of education in order that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is no longer fostered in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the third front against <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination the Bill provides for the settlement of alleged <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination by non-legal means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the legislation, every endeavour is to be made by the Commissioner to settle the matter, to promote understanding, to deal with the lesser excesses of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in a non-legal manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I witnessed <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a matter of great shame and regret that I witnessed people being whipped up in the hysteria of racialism in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The role can be made more meaningful and effective if expressions and actions of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination are prohibited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No longer will it be possible for misguided racially biased information to be circulated without the threat of sanction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without this legal sanction the Bill would have little effect in curbing <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill would be nothing more than an empty declaration of good intent or a belated recognition that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination exists in our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No one could assert that there is no <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who thinks that words are stronger than deeds- those who deny the existence of racism, those who talk about prejudice as if it does not exist, those who say this legislation ought not to be carried and those who are concerned to protect the guilty rather than the innocent victims of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination Bill ought to have been in operation at any time it was at the time that the Tasmanian Aborigines were being exterminated by the settlers in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many of the existing practices of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination will be outlawed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The continuing practice, which is prevalent in the inner suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne, of not accepting tenants because of their <span class="highlight">racial</span> background or accepting them on condition that they pay a sum of money in excess of that which would be asked of  Senator Greenwood  or  Senator Gietzelt,  will no longer be permitted under this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would imagine, when one listens to the Opposition, that we have never had a problem associated with <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely it is our responsibility to do something about these people and the children of these people- to bring them up in a neighbourhood and in a community free of any form of <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Recently a 12-year-old Jewish boy who was subjected to <span class="highlight">racial</span> comment and abused on a football field felt so incensed, because he believed that was living in a free society and because he believed in the policies of the Australian people, that he sought the telephone number of the Australian AttorneyGeneral in order to lodge his complaints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are many instances <span class="highlight">racial</span> injustices but time will not permit me to detail them to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will make it easier for people to defend themselves against <span class="highlight">racial</span> injustices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We write to urge your support of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was moved and seconded That this general Meeting of the Australian Council of Churches supports the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill, 1974, and informs the AttorneyGeneral of this, at the same time requesting him to ensure that those minority groups which suffer from dis.crirnination have substantial representation on the Community Relations Council which will be set up if the Bill is enacted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my mind the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill 1975 that is before us is, in its present form, in many aspects of the over-government type and is restrictive of the freedom of Australian citizens to express their opinions freely and to conduct their own affairs in accordance with the dictates of their consciences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Racial</span> discrimination’ is a term which should be used very carefully. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Personally, I define ‘<span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination’ as an expression of malice towards any human being because of his race. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel it is important to realise that much of what passes for <span class="highlight">racial</span> conflict may actually be more cultural or economic in nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I have no personal difficulty in agreeing fully with the assertion that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is evil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there anyone in this Senate or this Parliament who can produce a satisfactory model of a well functioning inter-<span class="highlight">racial</span> or multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span> society? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can it be shown that any country has more harmonious inter-<span class="highlight">racial</span> or inter-cultural relationships than Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that the provisions regarding the prohibition on propagatory war, national, <span class="highlight">racial</span> or religious hatred, was written into the United Nations International Covenant at the insistence of the Soviet delegates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, as I have said before, through the so-called intelligentsia in high places of learning that the disastrous philosophy of <span class="highlight">racial</span> warfare is created, nurtured and spread. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore in my opinion any <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination Bill should include a reference to the immoral ideologies by which racism is promoted at the expense of the dignity of humanity and all its individual members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Senate is debating the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first of those basic principles is that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination should be proscribed by law and that fundamental rights should be guaranteed without distinction as to race. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the outlawing of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination by legal sanctions is also a basis for changing community standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is felt to be a fairly obvious proposition in the view of the Government that <span class="highlight">racial</span> tension is best resolved by conciliation and not by enforcement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a fourth principle the Bill emphasises the importance of the use of education and other programs to combat <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A need is seen for the use of positive programs as a supplement to the provisions of the Bill- positive programs of education, cultural exchange, research and activity at a local community level in relation to <span class="highlight">racial</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said ‘helping to solve this problem in Australia’ because nobody on this side of the House would pretend for one moment that by passing a <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination Bill we are in any way solving the problem of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the highest we can seriously put it is that we believe- of course, we gather that the Opposition also believes- that the passing of this legislation will assist and facilitate the lessening of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While that is true, the origins of the Bill can be found perhaps in the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination which was signed by Australia in 1966. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1966 nothing very much happened in this country in relation to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination until this legislation was introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an interesting fact and a very happy fact for this country that both major political parties have in their platforms clauses which specifically deplore <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1971 the Australian United Nations Association set up in Australia a committee to combat racism and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am attracted by the notion in the long term of a multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span> society, both from a genetic point of view and from a cultural point of view, but I realise that there are very grave difficulties in that notion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was going around in nappies there was a lot of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in this country and there still is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lady in question took great pains to describe the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill as rubbish, and she used other terminology of a similar kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with  Senator Laucke  that of course multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span> societies have problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody here is seriously suggesting that passing this legislation we shall introduce a multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span> society tomorrow and invite all those sorts of problems which are attendant upon societies of that kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This group says that under the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill and Human Rights Bill and the Victorian Avoidance of Discrimination Bill a person who chooses to marry his or her race, ethnic group, nationality, or religion, and not to marry a person of another race, ethnic group, nationality or religion, does an act involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on colour, descent, national or ethnic origin or religion can be prosecuted and could happen under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, what this group is saying is that according to the view which it is spreading about the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill a person who makes a choice to marry a person of Australian ethnic origin can be prosecuted because that is racially discriminatory, but of course that is just stupid and it is typical of the sort of thing which is printed in this type of publication I referred to earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that this legislation should be supported not because we can hold out great hopes for changing our social and <span class="highlight">racial</span> attitudes overnight, not because we are going to create some new Utopia here which has not existed anywhere else in the world, not because we are a better people than any other people in the world and therefore are more capable of solving <span class="highlight">racial</span> problems, but because I believe that it will help us to change our society towards a greater tolerance and acceptance of people of different backgrounds, different colour and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We in Australia are just amateurs in <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that not <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Some days ago this matter was before the Senate for debate and I spoke for some time then on this <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill, so let me give a quick resume. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To talk about racialism in this country in the manner in which it has been talked about is, as I have said, nonsense because I would say that racialism in this country probably is practised less than it is in the big majority of countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much fuss is made of racialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we to be accused of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination because we do not like those people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a case of personal desires and personal likes, but legislation such as this <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill when put into effect, is the type of thing that can cause to develop, in the minds of certain people in this country, an attitude on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination that can be of a very dangerous character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is easy to say, ‘Someone acted against me racially’, or That person showed <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, that is a very simple type of racialism, and to what does it amount? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Goodness gracious me, we in this country are amateurs as far as racialism is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was that not racialism? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Were those fights not <span class="highlight">racial</span> fights? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>If we talk about fair dinkum racialism, we are amateurs and have much to learn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that many people who are running around about this <span class="highlight">racial</span> business are the opportunists, the self-seekers, and limelighters who want publicity in these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the person concerned has character and has within himself a determination to build himself and to go forward the silly things that people say about each other in <span class="highlight">racial</span> terms or in other discriminatory terms are just not worthwhile worrying about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact of somebody having a <span class="highlight">racial</span> attitude towards a person should not worry that person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is nothing worse than the mental cruelty that can be and is being inflicted on minority groups in our community by so-called law abiding citizens, and when the only ground for this discrimination is <span class="highlight">racial</span> it is indeed high time that something was done about that form of cruelty which not only disadvantages a person in the fields of employment and housing but robs him of his dignity and his pride. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill helps to protect people from <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in the fields of employment and housing and in access to places and facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, I will say that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in the 1970s is not as blatant as it was in the 1950s, but it is just as latent, and that is where the danger lies- in the latent discrimination that goes on, especially in our education system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People in ethnic groups are no different from anyone else in that regard, but within their framework of expectation they make allowances for the likelihood of being discriminated against on purely <span class="highlight">racial</span> grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am talking about people in ethnic groups who protect themselves from being disappointed or hurt simply by not applying for higher employment or better accommodation, solely because of the fear of discrimination on sheer <span class="highlight">racial</span> grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only do we lose any contribution that they can make to the community from their different personalities but we could be missing out on the undeveloped talents that they are holding back because of a perfectly natural instinct to protect themselves from being hurt on <span class="highlight">racial</span> grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Parties, for example, to the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination undertake to adopt immediate and effective measures, particularly in the fields of teaching, education, culture and information with a view to combating prejudices which tend to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and to promoting understanding and tolerance’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the widest possible educational and publicity campaign be undertaken and, in particular among disadvantaged sections of the population, with respect to the Human Rights Bill and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill, if and when enacted, and the Legal Aid Schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we live in a materialistic society today rather than a religious society, the same urge exists to solve all the problems of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination of one sort of another, not by the canonical law but by statute of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She attacked the whole problem of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination on the basis of sexualism that is to say, women are a deprived element in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Racial</span> discrimination against women as a sexual problem will not be remedied by passing laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to what I regard as the most dreadful form of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination which came out inferentially in  Senator Button’s  speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button  said that he believed in a multiracial society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he wants to believe in a multiracial society, so what? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What he forgets is that the majority of the Australian people do not want to have a multiracial society; they want to have a homogeneous society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Sheil  has said, the problems in relation to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia exist to a large degree because we have tried to create a multiracial society at least based on some common ground of a European descent, which  Senator Mcintosh  appears to disregard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The propaganda which was distributed in Australia by the United Nations Organisation and which was mentioned by  Senator Mcintosh  states that the United Nations was unanimous on this declaration regarding <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination; that all the people in the United Nations subscribe to this declaration without any demurrer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have here a list of the nations that have acceded to the United Nations International Convention for the Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There it is, a great part of the sub-continent of Asia with some 450 million or 500 million people, wracked by <span class="highlight">racial</span>, religious and caste discriminations, yet that country acceded to the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government of India declared that for reference of any dispute in the International Court of Justice, for decision in terms of article 22 of the International Convention for the Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination, the consent of all parties to the dispute is necessary in each individual case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, the United States throws the whole Convention out of the window and says: ‘We will make our own arrangements in relation to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination on the grounds of religion, cast and colour’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators have read the Melbourne ‘Herald’ this week they would know that in the Canadian Province of Ontario, which  Senator Button  praised as having a model statute of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination of one sort or another, there is more discrimination than in any of the other Canadian Provinces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet it has this model <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination legislation which, as I mentioned earlier, carries this exception to protect  Senator Coleman  from affronts of one sort and another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">racial</span> legislation in Canada has been praised by  Senator Button  and is held as a model for the Senate to follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet a report in an Australian newspaper by, I understand, a well respected correspondent says that there are more <span class="highlight">racial</span> problems in Canada than any other kind of problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The thrust of this Bill is to create a <span class="highlight">racial</span> industry in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Observations were made by  Senator Gietzelt  about <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in the election which  Mr Grassby  lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The population of the United Kingdom is involved in <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination to an infinitely more emphatic degree than the population of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Race Relations Board and its committees found 23 cases of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination concerning public houses in 1970-71 and in twenty-two of those cases conciliation was successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I am saying is that there is <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But its essential empire building projection, which in a substantial way, I understand, comes from the fair hand of  Mr Grassby,  will not succeed in solving the <span class="highlight">racial</span> problems in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not solve the problem of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination as referred to in the United Nations Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all it must tackle the problem of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination at its base. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination problem in which he is involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Work in it will probably begin to solve the problem of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we are committed internationally to try to solve this problem, I believe we must introduce a <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination statute onto the Australian statute books. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the comments of  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack and the references that he made to  Senator Button  and 1 or 2 other colleagues of mine, I do not believe that anyone on this side of the chamber believes that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination can be entirely legislated out of existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is unlawful will make it easier for people to resist social pressures that result in discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The barber states in a town where <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination does exist that if he cuts the Aboriginal’s hair his European customers will not patronise his shop; they will go somewhere else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If on the other hand the barber is in a position to say ‘the law forbids me from discriminating against Aboriginals’ he is then in a very much stronger position to resist those very social pressures for <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination to which  Senator James  McClelland referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill prohibits <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and incitment to <span class="highlight">racial</span> hatred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Sheil  offered the opinion that countries which have laws pertaining to race generally have more <span class="highlight">racial</span> problems than countries which do not have laws pertaining to race, a view which he subsequently contradicted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Greenwood  criticised the Bill on the ground that by forbidding the incitement to <span class="highlight">racial</span> hatred or the dissemination of racist propaganda it infringed the right of free speech, of absolute freedom of publication and of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However,  Senator Greenwood  did not bother to mention that the laws of defamation already provide substantial constraints against an absolute freedom of expression and of publication, nor did he explain why if the Bill is objectionable on those grounds the Government of which he was a member in 1966 voted for the United Nations Convention on <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination which is appended to this Bill and which provides for exactly the same prohibitions against incitement to <span class="highlight">racial</span> hatred and the publication or dissemination of racist propaganda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the <span class="highlight">racial</span> problemsseem  to me to be worse in those countries which have legislated in an attempt to solve the problems than in those countries which have not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of an aside it would perhaps be interesting to know how that great overseas campaigner against alleged <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudices in AustraliaMr Charles Perkins- would react to that statement by  Senator Sheil  given the recent flirtation between  Mr Charles  Perkins and the National Country Party of Australia of which  Senator Sheil  is a member, and also of course the rumours as yet undenied that  Mr Charles  Perkins will be seeking endorsement by the National Country Party for a Senate seat representing the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then proceeded to tell us that in terms of <span class="highlight">racial</span> persecution and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination we in Australia were just amateurs and that we had a lot to learn from the natives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be less malice in  Senator Wood  but nevertheless the attitude he holds towards people of non-European <span class="highlight">racial</span> extraction is, I suggest, quite clearly comparable with that of people who use more offensive terms like just down from the trees’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He seemed to say that the Jewish people have been enobled by centuries of <span class="highlight">racial</span> persecution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether intentionally or otherwise he appeared to advocate that <span class="highlight">racial</span> persecution- group persecution, <span class="highlight">racial</span> or otherwise- was something which would assist with the evolution of a superior species of humanity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to welcome the presentation of this <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill to this chamber and to congratulate the Government for having introduced it into the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination document which the United Nations produced was executed by the previous Government in 1 966. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my view that it is a pity that following the execution of that document legislation was not enacted at a State level, where there is less constitutional uncertainty, to deal with the question of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, 1 am seeking to assert the thesis that it is the view of this entire Parliament that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, one of the disfigurements of the 20th century, should be silenced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is some difference of opinion about the machinery that ought to be utilised by society and by government to bring an end to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there is nothing improper or disgraceful about having differences of opinion about the machinery, but I stress the unanimity of the Parliament in condemning <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the Minister in charge of the Bill that he ought to give very careful consideration to the amendments which will be put forward by the Opposition in the Committee stage of this Bill, because it is certainly my conviction that the amendments will in fact improve the legislation, would enable it to be introduced far more successfully into the community, and would in the long term aid the objective which I am sure the Government has of reducing <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first point is, of course, that Australia is a multiracial community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the first settlers arrived this country has been peopled by successive waves of immigrants, largely from Europe but also from many other parts of the world, and now, quite apart from any future immigration policy that we may follow, we have a community which is multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I speak of discrimination I simply mean that a large number of people are treated not because of what they are but because of their <span class="highlight">racial</span> heritage- because their parents were Aboriginal, Greek, or of some other race. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In just the same way, if we have a legislative framework which declares that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is illegal, that legislative framework in itself has some educative effect and it is part of the environment and the context in which people grow up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do think that law has a place in moulding community attitudes and that therefore the declaration that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia should be illegal is useful in itself as a long term educative tool. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their researches go dangerously close to suggesting that perhaps there are basic inherited <span class="highlight">racial</span> differences which ought to give rise to different policies for dealing with different races. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my view, the important thing is that the people of Australia should see that a Bill comes out of this Parliament that has the unanimous support of the Parliament, because I think that that in itself will be a big propaganda victoryand I use the word ‘propaganda’ in a nonoffensive sense, I hope- for those people who believe that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination should be destroyed in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If those people who are actively discriminating on the ground of race see that the whole of the Parliament is united in this declaration that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination should be unlawful, I believe some will lose heart at least to some extent and cease the sort of campaign that I think has been offensive to most of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people I have an obligation to look after under my portfolio have been referred to frequently and I think it would be accepted that, if there was any <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia, they would be the most aggrieved people by any racist attitude of the Australia public or of any sections of our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Sheil  is supporting that attitude and is perpetrating this lie for the purpose of carrying on this <span class="highlight">racial</span> fight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some people who may say that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination acts in 2 ways and that some preference is being given to Aborigines at the present time by way of the allocation of funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is significant that a <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill has only now reached the Senate after having been first introduced in November 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion, Australia is not in the throes of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination; and I emphasise that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that there is a pocket of discrimination; he said it is a pocket of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not prepared to admit that there is that pocket of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a pocket of discrimination, and there is a difference between normal discrimination and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that Australia is not in the throes of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination for these reasons: Accepted Government policy has decreed that Australia is not in the throes of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People from other lands have been made to feel very welcome, and indeed Australianborn people with <span class="highlight">racial</span> distinctions have been made to feel very welcome, provided they have been willing to accept the welcome extended to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we do not have that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination of which we have heard so much tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be isolated cases, but on an overall basis we do not have <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in our area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware of blatant <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, but I am fully aware of many acts of discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person could think: ‘I did not get this employment because of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That person, of a different <span class="highlight">racial</span> origin, would come to the conclusion: ‘I was not employed because I was of a different race’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there were <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination I would do my best, not only as a legislator but as a person, to see that it was stopped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not fair that there should be <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I honestly think that this legislation could be the means of insulting that section of the new races we have in Australia because it implies <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in an area in which I think it does not exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that we are a <span class="highlight">racial</span> community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not say that there was <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that we are a <span class="highlight">racial</span> community and I know we are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are a <span class="highlight">racial</span> community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have a state of affairs today in which people who have played a part in our society will get the idea that there is <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination of which 99 per cent of our community are not aware. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must ask ourselves this question: Has <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia reached a point at which legislation is necessary? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The book implies that there have been blatant examples of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination against a trained Aboriginal nursing sister who is employed by the Aboriginal Medical Service in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They show the existence of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is apparent from them that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is in fact occurring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just before the close of business last Thursday evening the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill came before the Senate and I spent 2 minutes speaking by way of introduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill comes to the Senate at this hour of the evening by way of contrast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Matters of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, matters of social equality and indeed matters of social inequality are very important and in current conversation have become popular issues today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill implements into our Australian law the obligations that are contained in the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, the Bill now before the Senate seeks to make <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination unlawful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I use the term ‘<span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination’ in the sense in which I read it in the United Nations Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These procedures are related to complaints of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an aspect of the Bill which relates to the development of programs of education and research which are designed to combat <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination- this is the area, as every honourable senator knows, to which this legislation is related- evolved after a good deal of study and analysis of the very difficult and sensitive matter of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, any discussion, study or research into the whole area of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination involves human relations, a whole lot of economic conditions and a whole lot of international conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As most honourable senators know, a declaration on the elimination of all forms of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination was drafted and was adopted in 1963. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general terms the Convention condemns and seeks the elimination of all forms of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The term ‘<span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination’ is one on which we can have debate and discussion over a long period of time but I take it at this point of speaking to the Senate in this debate to mean, as it was quoted in the Convention: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true to say that the Convention provides for us comprehensive measures of implementation and there is also the Committee on the Elimination of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Committee has been established to receive reports on the existence of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and to implement methods of conciliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we may have some support for the thrust of the Bill and the principles which it puts forward, legislation alone does not solve the problem of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, the problem of relationships between person and person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I recall his words correctly, he made reference to the fact that legislation has only a role to play in the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said the Bill is a step towards the objective as outlined in the Bill, so the Government has put down a measure which, while it is very comprehensive, is conceded by the Minister in presenting it to the Senate as having only a role to play and is a step towards the elimination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any program for the abolition of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination which involves the well being of a total community, a state or a nation the community must be reminded over and over again that it has a role and there are steps that it must take and that it has involvement and a responsibility in such a program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is referred to in various clauses of the Bill, and it relates to the dissemination of ideas on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination as contained in article 4. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in any discussion on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination it is important that nations involved take unto themelves the high responsibility of legislating as far as domestic matters are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt in my mind that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is something that we should seek to eliminate by the most effective means possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, as I said earlier, it is comparatively easy to lay down legislative processes that would seek to eliminate <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination but when you come to implementing them in human terms I ask the question: How do we really do it, do it effectively, and how do we do it so that the total society benefits and so that relations between persons and person, group and group, and community and community are maintained for the benefit and total development of the whole? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose it is easy to say that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination exists right round the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I might say that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination has existed throughout history that does not excuse me from being involved in legislative processes, or any other processes, that may help to avoid discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that mankind has had to wrestle, at some level almost throughout history, with the fact that <span class="highlight">racial</span> and other discriminations have existed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We of a European society and tradition are concerned about <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not without importance to observe that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination has been a factor not only of European society, it also has been a factor of other societies, and references have been made in this debate to discrimination in other communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it probably is true to say that we have been spared the worst excesses of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination simply because of the other conditions that developed in our society at the time that there were discriminating references and habits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we have had, as honourable senators know, our problems in this area and as a society the Australian community bears responsibility for what might be called <span class="highlight">racial</span> offences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make this reference because I think it is important in a discussion on a <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination Bill but I do not speak for the Committee and therefore my references must be general and I must speak purely from personal observation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allegations of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination within our Australian society have been many in the experiences I have had in relation to that Committee, but I would not be prepared to stand up and prove them in this Senate because there is a whole range of other circumstances related to such incidents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I may be wrong in describing this as <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether or not this can be proved or whether or not it is true I am unable to say at this stage but I became aware of what appeared to me to be an example of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination within our Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These could be expanded maybe but it becomes, as honourable senators would very well know, difficult to prove that a situation of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination occurs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it also should be mentioned that there is a growing number of people within our Australian community- there is a growing number of communities within Australiawho are seriously concerned, as have been speakers in this debate, about <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia and who through the various opportunities available to them are doing constructive work to combat discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our policies pursued by this country over these years have allowed not only a great development of our country but also a development of what I really believe to be good inter-community and interracial relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to draw a distinction between the earlier inter-<span class="highlight">racial</span> relations which have not been successful- at least in my viewand I am thinking of the discipline of assimilation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not good for society, certainly is not good for the people concerned and might very well be described as a form of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, in my thinking it is the most effective way to destroy <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not every <span class="highlight">racial</span> group in this country has been satisfied, but times and attitudes have changed and needs today are different from what they were even 5 or 10 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Developments in the last 2 years have been different and it is still a matter of concern to us all that there should be groups within our society- ethnic, <span class="highlight">racial</span> and migrant groups- that are not satisfied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am a little reluctant but I do mention that it is a matter of regret and indeed grief to some groups within our society that the Baltic community in Australia still has a very strong feeling that it has been the victim of some discrimination, so that when we undertake legislation here, whether it be the Government or the whole Senate, in connection with the matter of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, I think we have to be aware of the complexities that exist and aware of the fact that even the most finely developed legislation cannot solve all of the human and the personal problems in <span class="highlight">racial</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I acknowledge that the Bill seeks the goal of removing <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, I question sometimes in my mind whether it over emphasises the legal remedies to these problems as compared with other remedies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to educating people against <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination particularly as a long term solution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I merely cite it as an example as one way in which if not a knowledge of a language at least an appreciation of a language would help in this matter of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe, to be perfectly true, that legislation, worthy though it may be, cannot guarantee to heal <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to support the second reading of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill 1975 and also to support, at the same time, the amendments which the Liberal and National Country Parties will be proposing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are, of course, discussing a Bill which involves primarily and firstly the ratification of an international convention relating to the elimination of all forms of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill concerns <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in the broad sense in which it is interpreted in Article 1 of the Convention, namely, distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based upon race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen 81 countries ratify or accede to the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of my colleagues have said that this is not perhaps the worst country in the world for <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, that this is certainly a country with its tradition of freedom that ought to be in the forefront of those that proclaim freedom from <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and that set a lead to other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the subject was debated in the House of Representatives, there was a general unity of purpose on the part of members on both sides of the chamber and many were the illustrations of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of these problems, once again created by governments, we are now faced with this <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will now read in this context a statement which was made on the nature of race and <span class="highlight">racial</span> differences by a group of scientists, composed of physical anthropologists and geneticists, convened by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation in June 1951. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far from eliminating <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination by making it illegal, the Bill will highlight the problems between the races and create an official race relations industry with a staff of dedicated anti-racists earning their living by making the most of every complaint in much the same way as does the Race Relations Board in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wood  proceeded to tell us that racialism in this country is less prevalent than in the great majority of countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that that was an obvious statement but, at the same time, <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not accept that type of explanation and excuse for <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I were dealing with 3 wise monkeys I suppose that he would be the one who could see no evil because he has had a fortunate life of innocence in which he has never accepted that there is <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said: ‘I am not prepared to admit that there is that pocket of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in this country’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator has not read the Bill because the definition of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in the Bill includes national discrimination and ethnic discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are matters of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and are dealt with by this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, in reply to  Senator Bunton  who said that he is not aware of blatant <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in this country, I put it to him that some of the worst forms of discrimination are those that are not even known or appreciated by people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that the common law has never developed in such a way that it would eliminate <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existing rights and remedies are costly and difficult to deal with <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of this matter I would like to read the words of the Director of the Ontario Human Rights Commission who explained what was done in relation to his body’s conciliation approach to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same applies even more so in the case of statements on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in that respect that the Convention is somewhat obscure because, although it does call upon nations to make punishable by law the offence of the dissemination of ideas based upon <span class="highlight">racial</span> superiority or hatred, the Convention also says that each State Party shall prohibit and bring to an end, by all appropriate means including legislation as required by the circumstances, <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination by all persons, groups or organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the documents I have in front of me talks about a new tribe of <span class="highlight">racial</span> officials, who will be <span class="highlight">racial</span> police, being set up, who need not be members of the Public Service, or of Australian nationality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the innocuous badge of banning <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination the Labor Party has introduced the apparatus of the Police State, with its secret Police, empowered to engage in inquisitorial investigations, fines, imprisonment, arrest, damages and injunctions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>one remarks that this ‘ <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill ‘ was drawn up in its present form largely by a man of southern European origins and with a southern European temperament assisted, so he said, by a woman of southern European origins who was reared in eastern Asia and the Philippines . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am referring, of course, to the use of the expression ‘southern European’, which is apparently to be seen in itself as a denigration, and I say that that is more evidence- I will not join in the argument- of the desire to promote <span class="highlight">racial</span> disharmony in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have mixed feelings about it because for so many years of my life I have known <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice and discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was somewhat surprised to find that eventually they were prepared to say that they believed it was more properly a matter of human rights than a matter of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in the approach which should be adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always wondered whether our approach may not be better if we were not to emphasise <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination as though it were the only form of discrimination that mattered but rather to concentrate on ensuring the human rights of all Australian citizens in relation to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination or any other form of discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As is well known, this Bill introduces into Australian law obligations contained in the International Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event, I got an impression in listening to  Senator Greenwood  in this debate that he was a reluctant supporter of a Bill to outlaw <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, and I hasten to add that I am not attempting to overstate the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not for one moment believe that  Senator Greenwood  is in favour of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Manufacturing Industry  (Senator James McClelland)  whether it is intended to apply to the relevant authorities for the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination to be ratified and whether that application is to be made forthwith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination came into force as a convention in 1 969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first difficulty which comes to mind is that, on a reading of the Australian Constitution, the power to make laws about <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination seems to rest with the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is certainly no express power in the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws with respect to the outlawing of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Minister to Article 4 which provides that adherents to the Convention are to ‘condemn all propaganda and all organisations which are based on ideas or theories of superiority of one race or group of persons of one colour or ethnic origin, or which attempt to justify or promote <span class="highlight">racial</span> hatred and discrimination in any form, and undertake to adopt immediate and positive measures designed to eradicate all incitement to, or acts of, such discrimination’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, there is a requirement to declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> superiority or hatred, incitement to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also an obligation to declare illegal and to prohibit organisations and also organised and all other propaganda activities which promote and incite <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever one might say about ideas based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, just as one might say a lot of things about other social or political tenets to which one can express abhorrence, in this country we have endeavoured to provide as much free speech as we can. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They challenge freedom of speech on the justification, presumably, that such steps are necessary to abolish <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen in the United Nations how in the name of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination countries like Rhodesia and South Africa have been treated as pariahs and have been excluded from the world community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other countries which practise <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination are lauded in the United Nations and are permitted to condemn other countries while their own conduct remains unexamined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that the constitutional limitations, the general juristic limitations, on our power to deal with <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in this country will be considered by that Committee in considering as a result of complaints whether we have complied with the terms of the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that we are attempting to deal with matters of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in this country does not affect the fact that people who consider themselves to be aggrieved by our laws will avail themselves of their freedom to criticise us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to appear in the eyes of the world as a country which abhors <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, and which does what it can to eliminate <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, we just have to cop it sweet, to use a good old Australian expression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A nonracist society or a society which is trying to eliminate <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is, I suggest, a society which can stand such criticism and which can say: ‘We stand on our record and we are doing what we can to eliminate <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme of the Bill is that in clauses 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 there are a number of activities which are declared to be unlawful if they take place by reason of an act of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, as that expression is used throughout those clauses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the greater offence in the field of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would put the inciter of <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice in an analogous position of that of the pedlar of drugs, as against the man who harbours the <span class="highlight">racial</span> poison of antisemitism or anti-colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not see anything illogical or inconsistent in the proposition that it is more evil to incite to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination than to practise acts of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, there is the technical matter that the Convention does require us to make incitement to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination a criminal offence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, if there is the provision of services or the selling of a house and the employee or the agent commits an act of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in the performance of his duties, then that is the commission of an act that is unlawful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Prior to the suspension of the sitting I was indicating that there can be 2 reasons why an act alleged to be an act of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination has occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could be because a person was in effect racially discriminating and the other could be because he regarded the provision of a service or the granting of accommodation as a credit risk which he was not prepared to undertake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe it is incumbent upon anybody who wants to take to court a person alleged to have committed a wrong to allege that the <span class="highlight">racial</span> reason, if I can put it that way, was the dominant reason and not simply to say that it was one reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the person might also take a view based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be that the <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is a quite substantial element but not necessarily the dominant element. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is considered a wishy-washy point to make, I would refer to the sort of statistics quoted by  Senator Rae  in the second reading debate and to the statistics of the English Race Relations Commission which indicate that in that country, at least, a large number of cases are brought which are found not to be based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commissioner has two types of fuction One is to promote an understanding and acceptance of the various programs and need for avoidance of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this area of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, where we are making a start in this country with regard to a comprehensive law of this character, we believe it is tremendously important to tread carefully and not in an over-zealous pursuit of enforcement powers to create the possibility of a backlash that would do more harm in the long run than good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This makes a travesty of the efforts of an authority like this to do something about stamping out <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an outright prohibition on the dissemination of ideas based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> superiority or hatred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I share with nobody my detestation of ideas of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination based upon <span class="highlight">racial</span> superiority or a discrimination which seeks to evoke a superiority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly do not believe that we should start upon the prohibition of the dissemination of ideas, even if the ideas be those of the proper promotion of <span class="highlight">racial</span> superiority, and hope that thereby we will shut out a particuar argument or a particular idea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would prefer to see this clause removed entirely and I think that we do better in this area of trying to avoid <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, of allowing the free interplay of ideas, by hoping that the tolerance which ought to be current in this community to receive and listen to differing viewpoints, no matter how antipathetic they may be to us, will be encouraged and permitted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The speeches of  Senator Gietzelt  and  Senator Laucke,  for example, support the proposition that no man who advances an argument which suggests there are <span class="highlight">racial</span> differences can be actuated by other than ill will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are passages in those speeches which to me indicate that any proposition putting forward a <span class="highlight">racial</span> differentiation cannot be based on fact and hence must be activated by malice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any doctrine of superiority based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust, dangerous and without any justification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their inclusion in the Bill is likely to create, as it has in Britain, an ineradicable impression in the public mind that the whole Bill is concerned with the criminal courts, fines and imprisonment; the crucial element in the whole exercise, the tackling of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination by informal conciliation, may become de-emphasised; and public sympathy may tend to be directed more towards the discriminator, believed to be likely to receive harsh penalties, than his victim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the minds of some people apparently this can cause a great feeling of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a little bit tough for such people to be called up just because they say something or publish something that somebody regards as being <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is an example of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination between people of 2 coloured races. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This <span class="highlight">racial</span> business is a very vexed question and one which is very hard to straighten out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 29 (Inciting Acts of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The evils are bigotry, intolerance, <span class="highlight">racial</span> domination and suppression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have is the quiet development of a multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span> society, and it is successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same concept emerged in the recently passed <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill, where the Government inserted a provision enabling legal aid and assistance to be given to persons who wanted to pursue proceedings under that legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition amended the provision and we intended to ask this Committee to amend this provision in the same way as the Senate amended the provision for legal aid in the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, as I understand the position, is the precise wording which the Senate accepted regarding legal aid provisions in the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, we seek to follow the same procedure as was followed in the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill, which we think is a fair procedure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Specific reference to the Australian Legal Aid Office already exists in legislation passed by this Senate, namely, the Family Law Bill, and I cannot help thinking the objection to the specific reference to the Australian Legal Aid Office in this Bill, as with the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill which was before us a few days ago, is based on  Senator Greenwood’s  recently aroused antipathy to the Australian Legal Aid Office and is not soundly based in any particular principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that many of the oil producing countries, many of which previously were unsophisticated in money matters, would use people from their own area, their own <span class="highlight">racial</span> groups and their own religions to develop methods of handling this money and investing it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that it is also sensible that someone seeking funds from these areas should look to people who have had long experience in the area and who may even be of the same <span class="highlight">racial</span> group as the people in the area or even sometimes of the same religion, to seek funds, to find out where these funds come from and to investigate whether arrangements can be made to borrow some of these funds- not to borrow the money for us but to investigate the sources of the funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have even had an interjection of a <span class="highlight">racial</span> nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Country Party is advocating cuts in Aboriginal grants right around Australia because of their opposition, on <span class="highlight">racial</span> grounds, to the Aboriginal community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not forget the consumer protection legislation, the Trade Practices Act, which the Opposition would abolish, the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill and the Family Law Bill, which although not a Labor Government Bill was passed during the term of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no unity in mind, no <span class="highlight">racial</span> unity or unity by social contact, for example, between the people of Bougainville and New Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They tend to proclaim individual freedoms, that freedom of the individual means all, but then they bay for harsh censorship laws, conscription, restricted immigration based on <span class="highlight">racial</span> grounds, and the flogging and gaoling of people like homosexuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Attorney-General: Does the Government have an up-to-date estimate on when the International Convention on Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination is likely to enter into force for Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751007_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government propose to proclaim the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act as soon as possible after that Convention enters into force? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751007_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was pointed out that the Government considers that Australian participation in events in South Africa only serves to lend respectability to the continuance of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751007_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus I am informed that the South African Golf Union is an all-white organisation, and that there is also a non-<span class="highlight">racial</span> South African Golf Association which is mainly composed of coloured and Indian members, and a South African Bantu Golf Union for black people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751007_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government is firmly opposed to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in any form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751007_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that any other approach could be taken as implicit approval or encouragement of the South African Government s policy of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751007_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-5">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act be proclaimed this month, as the article suggests, since presumably an appointment under the Act would require the Act to be proclaimed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable senator will be aware, sections 1, 2 and 7 of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act have already come into operation but the rest of the Act has not yet come into force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is related to another matter which is part of the honourable senator’s question, that is, the date of coming into force in Australia of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that, as has been illustrated before, if one looks at the instructions to agents of the life assurance companies one can see that not only is there <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination but also there is sexual discrimination involved in their policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on 17 October adopted by a vote of 70 for, 29 against and 27 abstentions the draft resolution to have the General Assembly determine that Zionism is a form of racism and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee had earlier adopted 2 draft resolutions on the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination by votes of 126 for, 1 against and 2 abstentions, and 126 for, 1 against and 1 abstention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian representative on the Third Committee was instructed to oppose the draft resolution on Zionism, to make it clear in his explanation of vote that the Australian Government could not accept in any sense the determination contained in the draft resolution that Zionism is a form of racism and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The representative said that the Australian Government believed that the attempt by the co-sponsors of the draft resolution to equate Zionism with <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination was a distortion of fact, was unhelpful in the context of the search for a settlement in the Middle East and weakened the essential purposes of the 2 resolutions on the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think in our days in Opposition that we agreed to the Industrial Court, for example, being a court which could hear matters arising under the Trade Practices Act, under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act and I think also under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What might be termed the ‘immigration intake pause undertaken by the Whitlam Government was accompanied by overdue innovations which the various ethnic communities had sought in vain from earlier Liberal Governments, namely pension portability, removal of <span class="highlight">racial</span> clauses from the Crimes Act, liberalisation of income tax deductions for overseas dependents, and last, but not least, ethnic radio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that legislation on this matter has been passed by the Commonwealth Parliament and there is a man who holds the office of Commissioner for Community Relations whose job it is to investigate any allegations of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and, if he finds there are such allegations, to endeavour by consultation and talking with people to avoid the consequences of a practice which all Australians would abhor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mrs Betsie  Buchanan, an official of the Campaign Against <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Exploitation, said Aborigines were being forced to sleep out in the rain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Superimposed are factors such as <span class="highlight">racial</span>, social and community attitudes and behaviour patterns which are, of course, of fundamental importance in their influence on program formulation, on the one hand, and Aboriginal and Islander response to programs on the other hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet, many of the inter-<span class="highlight">racial</span> tensions between Aboriginals and others, many of the problems of local government and police might be alleviated by the provision of temporary accommodation for such transient Aboriginal people in city and regional centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly any criticisms that I have to make now would not be to the effect that the Government of India is engaging in any <span class="highlight">racial</span> or religious persecution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As this must surely constitute <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, I ask the Minister whether urgent measures can be taken to have the Commissioner for Community Relations investigate this case? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister assure the Senate that the Government will give increasing support to the Office and the officers of the Commissioner for Community Relations which, independently of government, have the task of combating <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Commissioner for Community Relations to ensure that there is no <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am able to give an assurance that this Government will do whatever is necessary to ensure that there is no <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination of any kind in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could get into a discussion with  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack on this matter, but let me say that Christmas Island has an attractive community with a wide variety of <span class="highlight">racial</span> and ethnic origins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned previously allegations of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination against Asian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Examples have been given to me of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination amongst Government employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As more of the Christmas Islanders come to Australia they will do a lot in this country to counter so-called <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and silly ideas people have about those of a different colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, irrespective of statements which people who are directly involved may have made, the Government’s philosophical approach is that it will have no part of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in whatever form it shows and no matter how dressed up it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act and the discrimination in employment question are classic examples of the failure of this Government to carry out the obligations which are imposed on it under international conventions and, particularly in the case of the discrimination in employment situation, the clear undertakings given by previous governments in Australia to establish a satisfactory method of endeavouring to prevent at a State level discrimination in employment in the signatory States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I now refer to the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill was passed with Opposition support although we did introduce some amendments which I believe improved it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If satisfactory action has not been taken or is not being taken would the Minister not agree that this is a case with unfortunate <span class="highlight">racial</span> overtones? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am informed that there is some doubt about this case coming within the scope of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act has already been implemented, all parts having become operative by 31 October 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-75-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (5) The functions of the Commissioner for Community Relations as set down in the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975 cover matters which involve various Departments and agencies in the Commonwealth and State jurisdictions For instance, the National and State Committees on Discrimination in Employment and Occupation operate as conciliation committees in regard to complaints of discrimination in employment and occupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-75-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is that we are not prepared to support teams or groups of sportsmen who want to come here but who are picked on a purely <span class="highlight">racial</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to a recent address by  Mr Walter  Lippmann,  Chairman  of the Ethnic Communities Council of Victoria, during which he expressed regret that the Community Relations Council has not yet been established under the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sort of matters to which I am referring include the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill, the Administrative Appeals Bill, the Family Law Bill and the Ombudsman Bill, which we dealt with just a few days ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an earlier question on notice I asked the Minister what steps the Government had taken to implement the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act and I was told in reply that all parts of the Act became operative on 3 1 October of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although we have <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination legislation, I do not think that it is being fully utilised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This applies a great deal in the north-west of Western Australia and in the gold fields areas where, in spite of our <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination legislation, Aboriginals still seem to be third and fourth class citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the latter situation is adequately covered by the <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination legislation which is not being put into effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to comments by the Queensland Minister for Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement, reported in the Brisbane  Courier-Mail  on 16 July 1976, that the team which produced the report alleging <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Queensland had ‘only made contact with malcontents’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation, therefore, is that a report was received in June which asserted the existence of widespread <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Queensland and I am still awaiting the report which the Commissioner for Community Relations has advised me will substantiate the assertions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I state, firstly, that the Campaign Against <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Exploitation- as part of the no ties with apartheid campaign- has sought the opportunity to meet the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence to put its point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister be issuing a statement on 2 1 March, United Nations day, against <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Otherwise we will end up with black power and guerrilla movements and  Klu  Klux Klan activities brought about by well-meaning but incredibly stupid people practising apartheid and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe there is sufficient bigotry, discrimination and prejudice in Australia without a member of this National Parliament going out of his way to make allegations which cast a slur on every member of a particular <span class="highlight">racial</span> group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here with Rhodesia was the issue- an illegal white racist minority government relegating its black people to the status of second class citizens, the entrenchment of white dominance and every other emotive <span class="highlight">racial</span> charge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But it amazes me that it was not so long ago, whatever of the record of South Africa may have been since 1900 or before in the field of cricket, that we had the situation in which Basil D’Oliviera, a prominent cricketer of mixed <span class="highlight">racial</span> parentage, was virtually denied the right to play cricket in South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are apparently in favour on <span class="highlight">racial</span> grounds of the separation of families, of people having to carry passes, of people not being able to have their families living with them, of people having to produce their passes while they work miles away from where they are supposed to have their homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one looks through the whole record of South Africa while the South African Nationalists have been in government one finds the Group Areas Act, the Bantu Education Act, the Immorality Act, the Unlawful Organisations Act, the Suppression of Communism Act and the Terrorism Act- every one of those Acts directed either to further imposing <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination on the people of that country or repressing those who set out to oppose it by means which in any democratic country would be regarded as lawful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the same way as the Jewish people of Israel or any other people in Israeldespite what the United Nations has decided, I do not believe that Israel is a country which engages in <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination- are entitled to their own nation, the Palestinian people are entitled to their own nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If an investigation of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination reveals that assertions presented by  Senator Chaney  are correct, the matter is one which I think should be referred to the Commissioner for Community Relations and I would certainly do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I emphasise, of course, that if we look at the union membership we will find that over the years people of a variety of <span class="highlight">racial</span> origins have served in various positions from sub-branch secretary or the equivalent of job delegate to national officers of the Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would simply say that in this area, as in any other, I will continue to be extremely hostile about any evidence of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in our country which contains a large multi-<span class="highlight">racial</span> element. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the Government that, in the light of the peculiar problems faced by the people about whom I am concerned and about whom I have spoken, a scheme could be devised on which limits could be placed, although not on a <span class="highlight">racial</span> basis, which would prevent it from being too large but which would meet the particular problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say to him that in view of his opposition to any form of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, I hope he will use his good intentions with some of his colleagues in his State who trooped north during the last Western Australian election to confuse the minds of so many Aborigines in the north of Western Australia over their rights to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have heard nothing from the Australian Government as to what it believes to be a minimum requirement of the South African Government before we would be prepared to say that it is making progress towards the elimination of apartheid and adverse <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the elections held in South Africa in 1974, which were elections in which only whites were able to vote, the Progressive Party- a party which may be a capitalist party and which may have all sorts of planks in its platform with which I would not agree but which is certainly a party that is committed to <span class="highlight">racial</span> equality within South Africa and an equal voice for all citizens in the government of South Africa- won seven seats, having won only one seat in the previous elections when  Mrs Suzman,  who for many years was its only member, was re-elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that it is small, but the very fact that one is able to find amongst white South Africans enough voters in 1 7 electorates to give a majority to people who are openly committed to <span class="highlight">racial</span> equality shows that there is a substantial number of white people within South Africa who do believe in <span class="highlight">racial</span> equality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That shows how it is a national government and not merely a <span class="highlight">racial</span> segment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 30 October 1975, the Federal Government ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Each State party shall take effective measures to review governmental, national and local policies, and to amend, rescind or nullify any laws and regulations which have the effect of creating or perpetuating <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination wherever if exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These acts are contrary to Federal laws, particularly Queensland’s Discriminatory Laws Act of Queensland, and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act of 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I make is that in 190 1 the Prime Minister of this country was prepared to assert himself in that clear way on a similar matter which involved people of <span class="highlight">racial</span> origins different from the bulk of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Furthermore, it has been a long-standing policy of Australian governments to oppose the importation into Australia of alien political and <span class="highlight">racial</span> feuds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This has forced the Federal Government to challenge directly the operation of the Queensland Acts which are themselves discriminatory and <span class="highlight">racial</span> in objective and content. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

  <li>
    <p>In this context I refer to the passage of the six Bills in the nuclear package- each of which in its own way represented part of the dilemma of inter <span class="highlight">racial</span> relations, particularly the Aboriginal lands legislation- the urgency debate in the Senate about Aurukun and Mornington Island, the debate which involved the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act, the problems we have had with the influx of boat people from Thailand, the refugees from Vietnam and the Papua New Guineans coming into the Torres Strait Islands, the controversy just yesterday over the Booroloola land claim report, our attitude to South Africa and Rhodesia compared with our attitude to other countries and the outbreak of several wars in black Africa, which is now alight with wars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All these examples highlight the dilemma of inter-<span class="highlight">racial</span> relations that is bedevilling us at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It also appears that two of the horsemen of the modern apocalypse are the ideological conflict between the East and the West and the <span class="highlight">racial</span> conflict between black and white. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, these twin horsemen of the modern apocalypse have now been harnessed together so that the ideological philosophy of the East is being used to cause <span class="highlight">racial</span> conflict in the West and thus hide the imperialistic expansion of the East. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the United States another <span class="highlight">racial</span> problem is posed by the negroes who were first taken there as slaves following another well known pattern of inter-<span class="highlight">racial</span> relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only the black man fits the world pattern of international political warfare directed against the West by the East, ls it any wonder that the countries most clamant against <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination are those who practise it most, that is Great Britain, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As long as the black man with his <span class="highlight">racial</span> origins and culture is forced to compete with the white man with his <span class="highlight">racial</span> origins and culture, the black man will be forced to the lowest level of the white man ‘s technical, industrial, dynamic, acquisitive and creative society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Would the Minister not agree that the position which Australia is following with regard to apartheid in South Africa and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in other parts of the world such as Rhodesia, may be taken by some critical observers to be somewhat hypocritical for so long as Qantas either refuses or discourages the travel by Australian Jews on Australian aircraft? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does the Attorney-General have any concern that the <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudices of  Mr Hinze  and his Government now appear to be expanding to cover certain migrant groups as well as the indigenous inhabitants of the State of Queensland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret to confess to  Senator Puplick  that I am not aware of the musician to whom he refers, of that musician ‘s <span class="highlight">racial</span> origins, or indeed of any comments that have been made about those matters by  Mr Hinze. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Questions under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act are matters for an independent statutory officer, the Commissioner for Community Relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure honourable senators, as an opponent of any form of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination or apartheid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can express forcefully disapproval of the deprivation of human rights, of torture, of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination or of exploitation of man by man in any country, and we should do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the heading ‘International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination ‘ the report states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 197S enabled Australia to ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 2 1 December 1 965. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On page 1 1 of the report there appears the heading ‘<span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination-Case Study of a Country Town’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because these people are black, because there is <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination against them by the white community, they are forced to tolerate it or be penalised by a fine of up to $40 or 14 days in the local lock-up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are people who try to close their eyes and say that there is no <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It deals with complaints of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, discrimination in Queensland, <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination at Ceduna and its aftermath, discrimination and the police, discrimination in the courts, discrimination in employment, discrimination in local government, discrimination in Aboriginal housing, discrimination in health services, discrimination in education, discrimination in school text books, discrimination in the media, discrimination in hotels, and so it goes on to chapter 19, dealing with the dissemination of <span class="highlight">racial</span> hatred and many other important matters, to which I am attracted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to do anything at all about <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, we need to have the problem identified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In identifying the problem he has investigated and documented evidence of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be necessary for us to keep those reports close to us because, to a certain extent, those of us who live a more urban life have been insulated against evidence of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At page 21 of the report the Commissioner, having referred to some 20 or 2 1 cases of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Queensland, in particular discrimination against Aborigines, makes this point: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of all the above allegations of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination on the part of the Queensland Government, I would draw attention to the fundamental freedoms and human rights which Australia guarantees to its citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are enumerated in many international documents, but those most pertinent to my operations are listed in Article 5 of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are incorporated in  section  9 of the  <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act  1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In compliance with the fundamental obligations laid down in article 2 of this Convention, States Parties undertake to prohibit and to eliminate <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in all its forms and to guarantee the right of everyone, without distinction as to race, colour, or national or ethnic origin, to equality before the law, notably in the enjoyment of the following rights: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my duty under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1 975 - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would also be wanting in my duty if I did not indicate the lack of co-operation of the Queensland Government in relation to my inquiries into matters of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would also be wanting in my duty if I did not indicate the lack of co-operation of the Queensland Government in relation to my inquiries into matters of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition I have to report upon deficiencies in Commonwealth legislation, principally the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975, in achieving even a proper inquiry into matters associated with the exercise of fundamental freedoms and human rights for all <span class="highlight">racial</span> groups in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>into associated with the exercise of fundamental freedoms and human rights for all <span class="highlight">racial</span> groups in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my conclusion, after considering all the matters referred to me, reviewing my actions and taking into account the expressed wishes of various communities in Queensland, that the Queensland Government presents a serious problem not only for the <span class="highlight">racial</span> groups which have complained in Queensland itself but for the whole of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the heading ‘<span class="highlight">Racial</span> Insults’ -again it is strange that the Aboriginal people should be involved- the Commissioner states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the past year the Office has received a wide spectrum of complaints against teachers who are alleged to have used <span class="highlight">racial</span> insults such as the following in their classroom and playground dealings: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we can clearly identify and reveal the problem of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination as it exists, we are bound to do something good about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to remind honourable senators that this Senate also has a responsibility to see that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is not practised against any one of its members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My mind returns to the time when  Senator Bonner  was discriminated against racially in a most abhorrent way in a Mount Isa hotel and we in the Senate stood by and did nothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to this report <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination is apparently prevalent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From time to time many senators and people in our community have expressed concern about some of the violence and <span class="highlight">racial</span> difficulties which are so much part of the scene in the United States and the way in which we allow our society to deteriorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What it might do is curb some of the more wildly irresponsible <span class="highlight">racial</span> statements that have been so deeply hurtful to large sections of the community, or at least ensure that the victims of such irresponsible statements will be given a right of reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Porter later rejected a call to the Federal Government by South Australian Premier,  Mr Des  Corcoran asking it to stop <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He came to power as a result of the division of his country along essentially <span class="highlight">racial</span> lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has been condemned by the Supreme Court of Pakistan, again along essentially <span class="highlight">racial</span> lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many Aborigines today still face that same threat and the desperate plight of others is met with indifference, because similar values and attitudes based on cultural and <span class="highlight">racial</span> difference persist among many white Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that as a matter of reality and as a matter of fact violence in any form threatens the peace, order or good government of the Commonwealth but engendering or engaging in activities encouraged to promote hostility or for that matter hatred- I take it that the Attorney-General has really borrowed the word ‘hatred’ from some <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination legislation in some place or other- does not as we put it, fall within the purpose of this clause in promoting danger to the peace, order or good government of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second illustration that must be a familiar one to us all is in the area of <span class="highlight">racial</span> hatred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am second to no one in my detestation of <span class="highlight">racial</span> propaganda of the kind that has been all too familiar even in current times in the Northern Territory and various outback areas of Australia and which is incapable of being characterised other than as directed to inciting hatred- not merely hostility- between different classes or <span class="highlight">racial</span> groups in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would guess that the circumstances that are most likely to attract this clause are inciting <span class="highlight">racial</span> feelings or playing on existing <span class="highlight">racial</span> feelings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act certainly will render some acts in this area unlawful, but it does not go so far as to render the incitement itself unlawful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I think that the <span class="highlight">racial</span> covenant does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That emphasises the very real concern in relation to questions of <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice that there can be such inflammatory actions, words and so on as to create a situation - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it the policy of the ABC news department to broadcast statements by unnamed and unidentifiable people which are designed to increase <span class="highlight">racial</span> tension in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not ABC policy to encourage <span class="highlight">racial</span> tension and reports on this matter did not incorporate inflammatory statements about Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-44">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the obvious <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination involved in the low wages currently being paid to the non-European employees of the British Phosphate Commission on Christmas Island, will the Minister recommend that the Federal Government become a party to the pending arbitration case involving these employees to ensure that they enjoy wage justice? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs aware that <span class="highlight">racial</span> standards apparently are being adopted by the manager of the Melanka Hostel in the Northern Territory and that on 24 May 1979 Messrs Nipper Winmarti Bill Okai Mick Mitingirri Pompey Whistler and Tony Jacobs were refused service in the dining room at the Melanka? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When NCI scientists reanalysed the Burk- Yiamouyiannis data, they found that the difference in the cancer death rate was due entirely to the age and <span class="highlight">racial</span> make-up of the respective populations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress at this stage that in both ZimbabweRhodesia and South-West Africa <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination has been eliminated in its entirety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Attorney-General: Was a complaint received by the Commissioner for Community Relations from the Winchinam and Burdel groups of Aborigines in Queensland that the Queensland Government was acting in breach of the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act in refusing the transfer to such groups of land intended to be purchased? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Commissioner, in accordance with section 22 of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act, call a conference of representatives of all parties concerned to try to resolve the matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Cavanagh  has suggested, a conference was called by the Commissioner for Community Relations on alleged <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination by Ministers and, I think, two officials of the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply say this: As I understand the  Broadband  program, it was alleged that a particular person expressed and practised pro-Nazi views and violent anti-Semitic and <span class="highlight">racial</span> tendencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If achieved, it will be acceptable to leading African states, it will remove a festering sore which has threatened to infect Southern Africa with both the poison of <span class="highlight">racial</span> war and great power conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy of the Progressive Federal Party does not provide even for voting rights for all black adult citizens, lt provides for a restricted franchise; it provides for a situation whereby, under its plans for the proposed South African Senate, all the <span class="highlight">racial</span> groups within South Africa- the blacks, the whites, the coloureds and the Asians- have a power of veto which is much greater than the limited powers that the white minority in Zimbabwe has preserved in the Constitution under which its is now functioning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prominent Nationalists such as  Dr Koornhof  and  Dr Marais  -one of the leading Afrikaaner capitalists; a back bencher but one of the most prominent thinkers on the Afrikaaner Nationalist side of politics in South Africa- have said that apartheid has to be ended, that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination at all levels has to be destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask whether it is a fact that the Lusaka declaration on racism and <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice, which the Australian delegation helped to draft, contained these words: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is responsible for producing reports on <span class="highlight">racial</span> relations, capital punishment, and all kinds of other subjects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Manifestations of <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudices are inconsistent with that non-discriminatory approach, especially since, as a nation, we have accepted obligations to resettle refugees here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is not the job of the Australian education system to solve in Australia the <span class="highlight">racial</span> problems of countries such as Malaysia, but as all honourable senators know, the students do come from countries like that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These factors include, and I quote, ‘low socio-economic status’, ‘a lack of motivation and purpose’, ‘stress and frustration resulting from cultural conflict’, ‘expression of group solidarity’, and the ‘expression of equality resulting from <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice and discrimination’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do they realise the achievements of the Whitlam Government, which included the introduction of national employment and training schemes, the abolition of the means test on the age pension for people over 70 years of age, the introduction of lone father benefits, child care innovations, the provision of telephone interpreter services, the removal of <span class="highlight">racial</span> clauses in the Crimes Act which has existed since 1 926, the introduction of pension portability and a host of other achievements? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like now to retrace my steps a bit and refer to certain <span class="highlight">racial</span> tensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then later this day the Senate is to debate the Human Rights Commission Bill and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Community Relations since the implementation of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act of 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, if the legislation which the Government has foreshadowed had in fact been introduced and passed today that process of emasculation of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act would, in a sense, have become complete. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commissioner, both at page 2 and again at chapter 7 of the report, refers in detail to the decision by the Queensland Government to defy the law of the land and to deny complainants under the Act the right to conciliation processes laid down under the existing <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another interesting section of the report is the review of the international scene in which the Commissioner contrasts the action taken at home to combat <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination with the Australian Government’s attitude overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He notes, for example that the Australian report to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination at page 5 stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 10 of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1 975 overrides any existing laws that may operate with a discriminatory effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commissioner says that in practice the Queensland Government has failed to recognise the existence of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act of 1 975 and, to all intents and purposes, the Federal <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act of 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adequate provision for research and education on <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination has also been stressed by Australian– <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is fundamentally opposed to and condemns all propaganda and organisations which are based on or profess ideas or theories of the superiority of one race or group of persons of one colour or ethnic origin, or which attempt to justify or promote <span class="highlight">racial</span> hatred and discrimination in any form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In practice, I have not been able to prevent the dissemination of racist literature, nor can a <span class="highlight">racial</span> or ethnic group ( as distinct from a person) have any redress under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975 against racially defamatory statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that regard it is worth referring to the conclusions of the National  President  of the United Nations Association of Australia,  Mr Richard  Alston, on the operation of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think a very interesting commentary on page 13 of the report points out that the Commissioner for Community Relations has not been consulted at all about the forthcoming amendments to the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On page 12 of the report the Commissioner also reiterates the suggestions made in his 1977-78 report for the better operation and implementation of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very interesting that those suggestions made on page 12 of the report as to how the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975 might be improved in its operations have not been tackled by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the Lusaka declaration on racism and <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice, which the Australian delegation helped to draft, contained these words: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw his attention to a startling statement made by the Commissioner for Community Relations that there were 30 <span class="highlight">racial</span> groupings with an estimated 100,000 members in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister inform the Senate of what steps he can take under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act to protect these workers against such discrimination? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Will the AttorneyGeneral tell the Senate whether he has received from Amnesty International, the United Nations Associations, civil liberties organisations and other bodies submissions in connection with the Human Rights Commission Bill and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill which have not yet been debated in the Senate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the Director of Community Welfare in Western Australia who asked him to go to Fitzroy Crossing because of the <span class="highlight">racial</span> problems that were emanating there, to make an assessment of the total situation and possibly to make recommendations on what could or should be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, I understand that  Senator Chaney  was at Fitzroy Crossing in August of this year, at about the time a great deal of this <span class="highlight">racial</span> unrest was making itself felt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We wish to make a complaint under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act, 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not correct since the selection criteria, the variations in the selection criteria and the ability to expand this scheme and the various schemes of reciprocal scholarships will in fact mean that the emphasis will be upon the selection of people of merit rather than the selection procedures which have been highly discriminatory in countries of origin in the past, as one can see from the practices involving the Malaysian Government in the way in which it has practised quite a considerable form of discrimination against students it trains in its own universities, and in the <span class="highlight">racial</span> composition of that group of students who study overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact, however, is that a vast majority of the overseas students in Australia come from a very privileged urban middle class social background and from minority <span class="highlight">racial</span>, religious, and language groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>abroad by <span class="highlight">racial</span> group; the percentage of respondents perceiving different problems as very important or important by country of origin; the long-run migration plans by country of origin and race; the indices of return for majorityminority groups by country of origin; and the index of return by sponsorship, scholarship, source of financial support, bound bond job guarantee student. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will close off for many students who belong to minority <span class="highlight">racial</span> or ethnic groups the only possibility for acquiring a tertiary education, given the quotas and other devices used by their home governments to exclude them from the benefits of teritary education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps this has particular significance when one looks at postgraduate studies because where one has research at a high level, it is quite clear that country of origin and <span class="highlight">racial</span> or ethnic considerations make no difference whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It reflects and fosters the xenophobic <span class="highlight">racial</span> attitude which lies latent in Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Attorney-General tell the Senate whether he has received from Amnesty International, the United Nations Associations, civil liberties organisations and other bodies submissions in connection with the Human Rights Commission Bill and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill which have not yet been debated in the Senate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the most succinct editorial comment on the legislation, taking into account both the Human Rights Commission Bill and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill however came from the  Canberra Times  on 29 September, when the following statement was made: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that in a number of areas like <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and also the protection of privacy effective investigative and conciliatory machinery can be as important in practice and perhaps even more important than the creation of formal rights enforceable through the courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the Bill does not give specific legislative approval to the ratification of the Covenant as did by way of contrast the Radial Discrimination Act 1975 in relation to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me now turn to the other side of the coin, the other piece of legislation, the companion piece of legislation that has been introduced, the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against that background, let us look and see what the Government is trying to do to the Community Relations Commission in this <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second criticism that the Opposition has about this legislation is that the various functions which are vested in the Community Relations Commissioner by section 20 of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act, namely investigation and settlement of complaints, promotion of compliance with the Act and general research and education to combat <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, are now all given specifically to the new Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, although it appears on the face of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill that there is nothing in it to directly stop complaints of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination wherever arising, including Queensland, being channeled directly to  Mr Grassby,  as they have been in the past, the Opposition believes that one must take into account the potential effect of clause 1 1 (1) (b) of the Human Rights Commission Bill, which has an effect, and which would make it possible for the Commonwealth to delegate completely to a State any function relating to the promotion of the observance of human rights, ‘including functions of the Commission’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot forbear from commenting that continued pressure of the kind that has so far been so successfully exerted in the past, for example, in relation to Aurukun and Mornington Island, may well result in the Commonwealth handing back to States like Queensland the domestic enforcement of all or part of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fourth general matter that I wish to raise about the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill is that  Mr Grassby  ‘s staff is to be transferred lock, stock and barrel to the new Commission, leaving him no powers at all of hiring, firing or deployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the attitude of the Opposition to this <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill 1 979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a proliferation of such machinery at both Federal and State levels in recent years, in the areas especially of <span class="highlight">racial</span> and sexual discrimination- if  Senator Maunsell  can bring himself for a moment to concentrate on concepts which will be entirely unfamiliar to him, I expect- and also in the area of privacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a substitute for other more specific, more piecemeal solutions to particular human rights problems in the privacy area, the sexual and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination area, the criminal investigation area and other areas as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Human Rights Commission Bill and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill, which are connected pieces of legislation, have been in gestation for quite a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that we can make alterations to the Human Rights Commission Bill which will turn the proposed Commission into an organisation which can be effective, but I do not see any way in which we can deal with the other Bill, the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill, which has been criticised so vehemently by  Senator Evans  this afternoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year the Australian Government submitted to the World Conference to Combat Racism and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination a national report which stated that action taken in this country to combat <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination had been based on five principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Racial</span> discrimination should be made unlawful by specific legislation; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Formal administrative machinery should be established for the investigation of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination on a systematic basis and to attempt to settle issues involving discrimination by conciliation; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A comprehensive framework of legally enforceable remedies should be created to provide redress against <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination where conciliation fails. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that we have adequately enforced that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination covenant as yet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By  Senator Alan  Missen on the terms of the 1979 Human Rights Commission Bill and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill (As introduced in the Senate on 25 September 1 979) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975, the Bill does not formally approve ratification of the Covenant although the Government has expressed its desire for early ratification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill is a complementary Bill which will transfer the functions, now performed by the Commissioner for Community Relations  (Dr <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contrast this Bill with the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act, which provides various offences which may be prosecuted to ensure compliance with the ‘International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination’, which we ratified in 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill ( 1979) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 197S was passed with the support of the ALP Government and the Liberal-Country <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commissioner for Community Relations, who already has specific responsibilities in the area of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, is not named as a Human Rights Commissioner and it is clear to me that he will not be appointed to such a position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is indeed a case for amalgamating the operations concerning <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination with other human rights (as the Galbally Report recommends), but not by downgrading the existing working operations of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act and debarring its Commissioner from the policy determinations of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His existing functions of promoting an understanding and acceptance of, and compliance’ with the Act, and developing research and educational programmes including ‘promoting understanding, tolerance and friendship among <span class="highlight">racial</span> and ethnic groups’ are to be taken from him (Clauses 4 and S). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bearing in mind the possibility of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination occurring in remote areas of the country, the contrasting power of delegation is significant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be noted that the powers over <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination now being transferred to the Commission are not ‘toothless’ but have been developed with limited facilities yet with overall success. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No action should be taken, either by reason of personal animosities or for other reasons, to weaken the operation of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975, which was an all-party endorsement by the Commonwealth Parliament of an International Convention to control <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill because that is a Bill which amalgamates the operations which have been effectively going on for a number of years under <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The weaker Commission will accumulate the greater powers which, at the moment, the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Commissioner has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know of one or two instances where people have submitted complaints which are not related to <span class="highlight">racial</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee expresses its concern that the Human Rights Commission Bill and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill, which are currently before Federal Parliament, would reduce the chance for such activities as those in Queensland to be documented and brought to the attention of the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Assurances have been given that this supervision will be of a general kind and that he will continue to deal with most if not all complaints under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the suspension of sitting, I was dealing with what are in my opinion defects in the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is that there is a possibility of a constitutional challenge to the whole operation of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is known that certain citizens- the Winchinam group from Aurukun- have indeed sought legal aid from the Attorney-General so that they can pursue their claims that may ultimately lead to a challenge from the Queensland Government to the validity of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is no time for us to make a major change in the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act when a challenge is about to be launched which will determine whether the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act is valid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is indeed an extraordinary situation where the Government of Queensland openly disputes the validity of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Aa of 1 975 and the Aboriginal Land Fund Act of 1 974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He of course there seeks among other things the support of the Commonwealth Government in defending the challenge- in other words, in defending the right of the Commonwealth to have taken the action under the International Convention and to have proclaimed and to have operated the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take a fundamental view in regard to the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the operations of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act since have been very good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore believe that the second Bill which is before us tonight, the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill, will weaken the operation of the present Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not satisfied with the amount of expenditure on and the amount of staff employed in the area of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am certainly not satisfied that it is proposed to have sufficient staff to cover the whole operation of the Human Rights Commission plus the area of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination, and that the staff will in any way be even as adequate as is presently existent for the Commissioner for Community Relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His two deputies are on loan from other Government departments, and all matters pertaining to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination are handled by a skeletal staff: eight in the Canberra office and one representative in Melbourne and Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commissioner has no representative in Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory, where some of the worst instances of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination have been alleged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither has a Community Relations Council been set up in accordance with Part V of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the weaknesses of the Act, the limited scope allowed the Commissioner for Community Relations, the failure to establish either a Community Relations Office or Council on a statutory basis, and the reality of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia, there are strong grounds for asking whether the Australian Government is serious in its commitment to fight for <span class="highlight">racial</span> equality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must take some action by throwing out this Bill to ensure that we do not damage the operation against <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will lose the real achievements which we made against <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination if we merely submerge operations of the Commissioner for Community Relations in the Human Rights Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will oppose the passage of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill because I believe it is contrary to what I have fought for in this Parliament and what I have voted for in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Human Rights Commission Bill 1979 and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill 1979 are being debated together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We understand that the Human Rights Commission Bill and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill will be before the Senate in the immediate future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst recognising the neatness of bringing all the human rights mechanisms under one Commission, we submit that these Bills, if passed, will make almost totally ineffective the operation of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act (1975). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new legislation will prevent the Commissioner for Community Relations from reporting directly to Parliament, from receiving any complaints directly from persons in the community, or from developing programmes aimed at raising the awareness of Australians about the reality of our multiracial multicultural society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here I want to interpolate to say that it is amazing that the Australian Government firstly, should have introduced amendments to the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill 1979, and, secondly, should have introduced the Human Rights Commission Bill 1979 at this particular point in our history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the community relations organisation was set up, it was set up with the specific task of eliminating <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia so far as it was humanly possible to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The functions of the Commission will be limited to the investigation of complaints of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That might be appropriate there, but it is not appropriate in this country, where we are trying to get rid of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our Commission has applauded the efforts of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in action against <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Africa recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But neighbouring peoples rightly ask us, ‘What is your government doing about <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not want to have to reply that our government has emasculated the only effective piece of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination legislation that we had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We submit that for the Parliament to proceed to pass the Human Rights Commission Bill while amending the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act in the way proposed, will serve to prove to the world that the Human Rights Commission Bill is just a piece of window dressing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister of this country wants to be able to parade on the stages of Africa and in forums around the United Nations and say that there is no <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What actually happens while he is putting up this facade of political window-dressing in these areas is that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in this country, because of the amendments in the one case and the new Bill in the second case, will be aggravated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the amendments contained in this <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill are carried, the Commissioner for Community Relations will only be able to read these types of things and pass them on to the too hard to answer file because he will have no authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They portray our people in worst possible light especially because of false generalised statements regarding social security benefits and work attitudes will promote <span class="highlight">racial</span> dissension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Keeffe  is addressing himself to the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill, which is being discussed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Believe these articles deliberately designed promote <span class="highlight">racial</span> tension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was put out by the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations and it refers in particular, naturally, to the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975 and what this Bill seeks to do to that Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The constitutional validity of the present <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act is under challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its validity cannot be resolved by superior Courts unless an aggrieved party initiates action under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 197S. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You might recall,  Mr Acting Deputy President,  that two nights ago in this chamber I referred to a letter which had been written by  Mr Porter,  the Minister for Aboriginal and Islander Affairs in Queensland, in which he made some very cynical remarks about the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1 975 without actually naming the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit most respectfully,  Mr Acting Deputy President,  that if  Mr Porter, Sir Charles  Court or anybody else- even the other  Mr Everingham-  want to test the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1 975 they will find that it will stand up to a High Court challenge also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The working paper then refers to the four annual reports of the Commissioner under the heading ‘The reality of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Racial</span> prejudice and discrimination particularly affect the lives of the Aborigines and other coloured groups but ethnic groups also are victims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remainder have spanned every other <span class="highlight">racial</span> and ethnic group in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Racial</span> prejudice has led to infringements of human rights and restrictions of fundamental freedoms as spelt out in the International Covenant on which the Act is based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The constitutional validity of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 197S has been questioned since it became law on 31 October 197S. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act applies equally to all residents of Australia and her external territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to address my remarks to the Human Rights Commission Bill and, to a much lesser extent, the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am still undecided on the question of the second reading of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Distrimination Amendment Bill and I am waiting to be persuaded by spokesmen for the Government’s point of view about the validity of that piece of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has no more important role than the role that it plays in debating legislation like human rights and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In my notable speech to the Senate last Thursday on the Human Rights Commission Bill 1979 and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill 1979-1 will be concluding my speech with only a few short remarks- I pointed out the basis of my grave misgivings concerning the Government’s good faith even in presenting this human rights legislation to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I join the debate on the Human Rights Commission Bill 1 979 and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will perhaps accomplish with the Bill in its present form another toothless tiger such as the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In most of these cases, particularly where <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination or breaches of human rights occur, it is the most unfortunate people, economically, educationally and in other ways, who would not have the wherewithal to be able to carry out that kind of prosecution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that he has promoted cultural and <span class="highlight">racial</span> awareness, throughout the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, as I said, this Government should move to promote greater <span class="highlight">racial</span>, cultural and ethnic awareness throughout the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would envisage <span class="highlight">racial</span> and cultural programs at schools to develop in our young people an awareness of the richness of the cultures of minority groups which presently make up our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are becoming a multiracial society because people are coming here from all parts of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that <span class="highlight">racial</span> stability and cultural understanding cannot be enforced, but they can be taught. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would be a way of overcoming some of the <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudices which exist and the lack of human rights in certain areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that such a provision is completely unacceptable if we are to have fair dinkum legislation in relation to human rights and <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said time and time again that in relation to stamping out discrimination the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act of 1975 has always seemed to me to be a toothless tiger as I have always felt that in most instances discrimination is a state of mind, an inherent belief, which can be eliminated only by reason, greater knowledge, tolerance and understanding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am confining most of my remarks to the <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination aspects of these two Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that because I disagree with the amendments to the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act which will bring the Commissioner for Community Relations under the new Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will have no way of doing things on his own behalf, as he has been doing by travelling around the country and setting up in different towns voluntary organisations of groups of people who are interested in looking into acts of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate, in debating the issues of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and human rights, is really beginning to concern itself about democracy and about the interpretation of democracy as it is applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The demand for legislation to deal with <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and human rights is synonymous with demands that are being made in many countries in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a form of discrimination, and yet this legislation does nothing to overcome the obstinacy and the refusal of State governments to come into line on the question of human rights and against <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So while the Opposition recognises the tentative step that this Government has taken in this legislation, we nevertheless feel that it is purely a first step in a very long march towards an understanding of human rights and ending <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To say that it is more than that would be to gild the lily very considerably because this legislation will not put an end to <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack),  I am the eighth senator to speak- there have been four speakers from the Opposition side and four from the Government benches- and so far everyone except the Attorney-General has criticised the Human Rights Commission Bill 1 979 and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill 1 979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cognate Bill, the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill, can be seen as a comment on the thinking behind the Human Rights Commission Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Democrats join  Senator Missen  in rejecting the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill unless it is substantially altered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the record I want to read into  Hansard- on  which note I shall conclude- the frightening number of right wing <span class="highlight">racial</span> organisations in Australia right now which propagate <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice with the help of massive resources of money from unknown sources and against which this Human Rights Commission will be virtually powerless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has come to the situation which is right for the racist, the extremist, the total fruit cake to exploit <span class="highlight">racial</span> and religious divisions in our midst. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The thing that makes me sad as I speak on this Bill is that the emasculation of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act will do nothing to fight the garbage, the hatred, that is being put out by these twisted people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We agree that the Human Rights Commission Bill is edentulous and that the amendments to the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act will emasculate it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second was the Declaration on the Elimination of all Forms of <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination in 1963. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to support the Human Rights Commision Bill 1 979 and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill 1 979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, I listened to his criticism of the <span class="highlight">racial</span> legislation and its effect on the  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been a classic phenomenon in the American experience that the worst breaches of human rights, particularly in the <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination area, were in the State area in the South. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The precedent for this action is very obviously the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act of 1975 when precisely the same clause was carried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is acknowledged by the Opposition, as it was by  Senator Missen,  that a provision of this kind, albeit that it does appear in the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act, is not technically necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the merit of  Senator Missen  ‘s proposal, which is in similar terms to the proposal put forward by the Labor Party and endorsed by the Australian Democrats, is that it may, along with the similar clauses in the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act and the proposed similar clause in former  Senator Murphy’s  Bill on Human rights, build up a practice whereby this Parliament is involved in the process of telling the international community that we will be bound in some particular manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only other matter I wish to mention relates to the proposed amendments to the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will preserve the powers of the Commissioner for Community Relations in relation to investigations of complaints about <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, this proposal to amend the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act is designed simply to rationalise the machinery so that, when the proposed Commonwealth institution, which will have an overriding position in relation to human rights, is established, it will have that power in relation to the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act and in relation to other specific Acts in that area which might be passed by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we have a commissioner for <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination on the Commission, people will want various other specialist areas to be represented specifically also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Attorney-General tell the Senate whether he has received from Amnesty International, the United Nations Associations, civil liberties organisations and other bodies submissions in connection with the Human Rights Commission Bill and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill which have not yet been debated in the Senate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have received representations from many organisations, including Amnesty International and the United Nations Association of Australia, concerning the Human Rights Commission Bill 1977 and also the current Human Rights Commission Bill and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that that Bill has the effect of incorporating the <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination administration under  Mr Grassby  in the operations of the Human Rights Commission but does not make him a commissioner of the Human Rights Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of that is that one member of the Commission, which is to consist of a  chairman,  a  deputy chairman  and not less than five nor more than nine other members, would already have been already identified as the person who holds the rank and office, under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act, of Commissioner for Community Relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been a proved and tried method under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill which has yet to be discussed in detail,  Mr Grassby  is to be under the direction of the Human Rights Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill, no opportunity will be presented for him to have a separate staff, but he would be in a position to argue the need for such staff if he were a commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It meets the requirement that we should not in any way turn the <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination administration into a defective organisation; that we should not create a situation in which there will be a clash between the Human Rights Commission and the Commissioner for Community Relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For these reasons I have moved this amendment, which I regard as extremely important to the continuing operation of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination oversight and the most effective working of the Human Rights Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter for great regret that the vote to reject the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill was lost last night only by one vote, as a result of the indavertent non-appearance in the chamber, in time, of  Senator Harradine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that a consideration of this kind is at best a barely veiled rationalisation of the Government’s real reason; that is, it finds  Mr Grassby,  the present Commissioner, a political embarrassment not because of his previous party affiliations but because of the way he so relentlessly exposed the deficiency of governmental activity both at the State and Federal levels in protecting our citizens against <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said in my speech at the second reading stage, it is no accident that in the corridors of this Parliament back bench Liberal members are referring to the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill as the Get Grassby Bill’, because that is what it is about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill, which had its second reading last night, the various powers vested in the Commissioner are now to be taken from him and formally vested in the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is further obvious from the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill that  Mr Grassby  will no longer have the right or the duty to prepare and deliver reports to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has sought to pretend and claim to the community at large that nothing is changing, that something is being added to the present structure for the protection of human rights, but that nothing is being taken away and that it is business as usual as far as the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act and  Mr Grassby  are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems ludicrous to me that we are setting up the Human Rights Commission and that part and parcel of that Commission will be the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act under which the person holding the office of the Commissioner for Community Relations is to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am giving my total support to this amendment because I believe it is necessary, if we are to have Human Rights Commission and if we are to maintain the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act and the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations, that the Commissioner have a vital role to play on that Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Human Rights Commission Bill and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill are passed, that valuable body of experience, going back many years, will be embodied only in the person of the Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if somebody else were to be appointed to that position, I must say that I think that person, if he were a person of great integrity and great capacity, probably would want to think twice about taking a position which potentially was of such subservience as these Bills, the Human Rights Commission Bill and the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Amendment Bill, would reduce it to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that <span class="highlight">racial</span> issues are in fact the critical human relations issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the support which both sides of the Parliament gave to the original <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act indicates that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the support given to it in its eventual form by distinguished former Liberal senators, such as the late Ivor Greenwood, and the way in which he linked the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act with the first statutory reference to the International Covenant, indicate the seriousness with which honourable senators on this side of the Parliament have regarded the problems of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been stressed each year that lack of resources in personnel and finance have made it impossible to make the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975 and its provisions widely known and more readily accessible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw attention to what I believe to be the likelihood of <span class="highlight">racial</span> issues becoming more prominent in Australia and needing greater vigilance on the part of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice against the Aboriginal community appears to be more of an issue in recent years is quite simply because Aboriginal people have attempted in recent years to assert and claim their proper and full rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last night  Senator Chipp  indicated, while reading out a list of the hatred and filth pedlars in this community, that there are groups at work in the community and throughout the political framework whose objective is simply to promote <span class="highlight">racial</span> hatred and <span class="highlight">racial</span> prejudice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct the attention of honourable senators to those criticisms- the criticism that the Commissioner is placed under the control of the Human Rights Commission, that complaints will not be as easily handled by the Commissioner in the future, that he will be subject to directions that his access to staff will be reduced, that his report to Parliament will disappear and that his role in promoting an understanding and a public awareness of <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination matters will also disappear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To bring about a situation in which a Commissioner for Community Relations whose prinicipal job will be to warn Australia about and to monitor in Australia the activities of those who would promote <span class="highlight">racial</span> hatred and division in this country is a matter that requires attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every day of every week the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  considers the issuing of deportation orders against people who come to this country and seek to stir up <span class="highlight">racial</span> hatred and <span class="highlight">racial</span> opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is aware, this Government is aware and the Labor Government was aware of the necessity to ensure that <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination in Australia is treated as the sort of community disease that it is and that actions are taken in order to prevent the spread of the disease and to excise the cancer of the disease whenever that is possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It so happens that at the moment we do have a Commissioner for Community Relations appointed under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is fair to say that if the Government was considering these questions afresh and was entirely able to develop its own blueprint for a Human Rights Commission and a human rights approach, it would be doubtful whether it would actually create a statutory position of a commissioner of human relations as has been created by the Labor Government under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the indications from the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill are that we will assign the Act functions to the Human Rights Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed amendments to the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act give an indication of the thinking that I have expressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a Minister of the Crown to find it degrading to mix with Aborigines who are, after all, his voters and constituents seems to me to be related to the problems we were discussing yesterday on the <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination and human rights legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My views on that matter were reinforced in a document which I received today, which was prepared by the office of the Commisioner for Community Relations under the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst on the face of it this is a somewhat innocuous provision, perhaps even a convenient one, it has given rise to a good deal of concern, particularly in the context of the administration of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This clause, if applied literally, would enable the new Commission to divest itself of the administration of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act and to vest that in the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the Commonwealth could hand back to the Queensland Government the administration of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know the Director will appreciate that there has been considerable <span class="highlight">racial</span> resentment among the different groups when negotiations were submitted to them in the form of a package deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>enable the Institute of Multicultural Affairs to conduct research into and foster community sensitivity for <span class="highlight">racial</span> groups not the subject of study by the Institute of Aboriginal Studies while including the latter in the ambit of multicultural affairs; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should be there to ensure that any research does not fall into the trap of trading one ethnic group or <span class="highlight">racial</span> group off against another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And I have been receiving letters from a commissioner (he could not remember the name) charging me with <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also an enforcement procedure which is entirely in accordance with the existing provisions of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act which this Government has not been minded to oppose or to seek to amend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than engage in any kind of drastic surgery which the Government is unlikely to accept, given its track record in these matters, I simply ask the Government to accept the amendment in these terms because these are terms which are exactly paralleled in the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Act, an Act which the Government supported when in Opposition in 1975, which it has done nothing to amend subsequently and which it ought to be able to accept as a matter of policy and principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When asked about the imminent disappearance of the office of the Commissioner for Community Relations, the Minister replied: ‘The Federal Government has decided to create a Commission for Human Rights, and one of the Commissioners of this body will be responsible for watching out for <span class="highlight">racial</span> discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the International Olympic Committee violated its own rules by agreeing to hold the Games in a country where there exists <span class="highlight">racial</span>, national, political and religious discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as the International Year for Action to Combat Racism and <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination will the Government make an early statement on whether it will actively support this decision, which would be in line with Australia’s subscription to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  1 said that I thought the question should properly be answered by the Minister for External Affairs, who has provided the following answer: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, conduct of the kind reported would be made unlawful by those provisions of the <span class="highlight">Racial</span> Discrimination Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
