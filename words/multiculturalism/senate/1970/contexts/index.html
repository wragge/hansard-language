<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It agrees there is a need to change the direction of its services to migrants and that further steps to encourage <span class="highlight">multiculturalism</span> are needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposals are in the fields of initial settlement; English language teaching; communication; information; voluntary, self-help and Good Neighbour Council services; special need and special groups; <span class="highlight">multiculturalism</span>; ethnic media; and co-ordination and consultation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet despite this, the <span class="highlight">multiculturalism</span> of society is muted through the dominance in all facets of life by Australians of Anglo-Saxon background, and consequently on the surface Australia still looks very much an Anglo-Saxon country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable senators I present a paper entitled ‘<span class="highlight">Multiculturalism</span> and its Implications for Immigration Policy’ prepared jointly by the Australian Population and Immigration Council and the Australian Ethnic Affairs Council, together with the text of a statement by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs relating to the paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide the Institute with a more positive responsibility for the maintenance of cultural identities and traditions and encouragement of <span class="highlight">multiculturalism</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his second reading speech, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  said that one of the early objectives of the Institute would be to define <span class="highlight">multiculturalism</span> and then to follow that through with various worthy aims, which would include the development of awareness among cultural and ethnic groups, the promotion of tolerance, understanding and mutual esteem, the promotion of cohesiveness through existing political and legal structures, and the promotion of an environment conducive to participation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a strong case, I believe, for <span class="highlight">multiculturalism</span> at work to receive far more study and research than it has in the past, and a strong case for that study to be contracted out of people who are experts in the field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Multiculturalism</span> in the work force, simply because so many of our post-war and recent migrants are propelled into the work force and it is a major focus of their lives, will remain an important issue because it affects so much of a migrant’s place in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said: ‘<span class="highlight">Multiculturalism</span> exists where one society embraces groups of people with different cultural identities’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It claims that <span class="highlight">multiculturalism</span> is either a mosaic and it is the job of education to recognise and delineate the parts of that mosaic or else should be seen as a goal and in that case the education system should have a mobilising role in promoting the concept of <span class="highlight">multiculturalism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be held very tightly in shackles so that anybody who might have any genuine ideas about getting <span class="highlight">multiculturalism</span> together in Australia will find that he is brought to a sharp and sudden halt by the mere fact that the Government has a system of appointments, not only the appointment of the council, to which the Australian Labor Party has moved an amendment, but also in clause 10 the actual appointment of members of the Institute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next concern of the Opposition was to provide the Institute with a more positive responsibility for the maintenance of cultural identities and traditions, and encouragement of <span class="highlight">multiculturalism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been much discussion on the issue of <span class="highlight">multiculturalism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people have expressed the view that the concept of <span class="highlight">multiculturalism</span> implies some sort of separate development of various groups; a sort of cultural isolationism where separate groups in our society ought to be able to adhere to different languages and cultural traditions without really coming the grips with each other, and promoting tolerance and understanding amongst the various ethnic groups in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the concept of <span class="highlight">multiculturalism</span> does embrace all cultures in a nation and the Aboriginal people are an integral part of Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
