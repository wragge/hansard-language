    <p>The so-called radical people of the Gazelle Peninsula with whom  Mr Whitlam  had this fantastic meeting, are people who have been <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> by other people of various nationalities - first by the Germans, then by the Australian planters, and for a time by the Japanese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet all over the country workers <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> by the increases in costs are in desperation, going on strike for increased wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am prepared to concede that nothing is too good for the representatives of the downtrodden and <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> masses, but a net profit of 5247,000 is really laying it on a little too thick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After they got $247,000 a year from the downtrodden and <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> company with operates 3KZ, Val Morgan and Sons Pty Ltd, they charged $1,000 a year for the rental of their aerial field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Protests have been made in the British Parliament on behalf of Frank McManus and civil liberties because of this shameful treatment of a member of Parliament who demonstrated only to win some liberties for an <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> section of the population of Northern Ireland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no coincidence that people who could not care less about what happens to native peoples, people who have spent their entire political lives in foreign countries - I am not talking about my friends opposite - while their own people have been suppressed, have suddenly developed a charitable interest in the downtrodden and <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> masses of South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My friend  Senator Milliner  had occasion also to paint a rather dramatic picture of the poor downtrodden and <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> worker coming home from his honest day’s toil only to find that prices have gone up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If good books can influence human beings in favour of good living and high causes - like the liberation of the <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> or inter-racial justice- the converse logically applies, that bad books can stimulate the mind and imagination in ways that are socially baleful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The downtrodden and <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> battler pays the same sales tax as the wealthiest member of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have demonstrated our active concern for the rights of peoples <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> in Rhodesia and South Africa by voting in favour of the last 2 United Nations General Assembly resolutions on Rhodesia, which we had not previously supported, terminating al] trade to and from Rhodesia, and by seeking the closure of the Rhodesian Information Centre in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The force and terror being used in Rhodesia have been used against the vast majority of the people who are being <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> by an illegal, racist minority in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Far from being the representatives of the downtrodden and <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> the Labor Party became the representatives of wealthy industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Very often those who are producing the works of art are the ones who are doing more to overcome the suffering and to uplift the <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> than those in whom the honourable senator finds his solace and comfort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that there was developing in the Australian community a section of people who saw a career ‘in championing the cause of the <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition wants the Aborigines of Queensland to decide this vital issue of whether we should play our part in relation to the indigenous people of the <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> countries of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether I did or did not is no justification why  Senator Bonner  should keep his people in Queensland <span class="highlight">oppressed</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does it still hold to the view of some of its leading members that the fighting in Vietnam is an uprising of <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some women speaking out, but there are thousands upon thousands of women who do not know that they are <span class="highlight">oppressed</span>, who do not know that life could be better and who do not realise what society is doing to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, if so, what safeguards will the Commonwealth insist upon to protect already <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> salary earners from savage tax slugs which money-hungry States will be able to impose at will? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It saddens me that the Government appears to have concluded that those best able to make sacrifices are those with the most experience in bearing hardships- namely, the poor, the sick, the <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> and the needy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I doubt that the Timorese people were any more <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> than were the people in metropolitan Portugal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I made a plea for the Federal Government, which has responsibility for Aboriginal affairs, to do something concrete to see that this matter would not be pigeonholed; that the recommendations would be carried out; that something would be done to ensure that never again, against an <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> people of Australia, would a Skull Creek incident happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Communist policy is for complete support of Indonesia ‘s claim to West Irian and complete independence for the peoples exploited and <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> by Australian capitalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it might be useful for this country if the Labor Party, which is supposed to be the friend of the <span class="highlight">oppressed</span>, came out and supported what is a most substantial reform in favour of 800 000 children in the community who are in relatively poor circumstances in the 300 000 families which are in relatively poor circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point probably does not need to be laboured that when it was in power the Labor Government’s approach to morality in politics and its concern for <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> peoples was well demonstrated in the decision to accord de jure recognition to Soviet control over the Baltic States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He gave the lie to those who would suggest that the biblical injunction of turning the other cheek, which is important for individuals, means that one is able to lift the head of the <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> so that the oppressor can beat it again and again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#debate-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate will recall that the liberators of the <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> had become the oppressors again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is about time that the rights and justices which we so correctly demand for the <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> in Russia or Chile are no longer denied to our own Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in relation to that child the term ‘right to life’ means that he should not be lonely, <span class="highlight">oppressed</span>, diseased, underprivileged, hungry, orphaned, battered by drunken parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole history of” mankind shows that if people are <span class="highlight">oppressed</span>, no matter their nationality, their colour or their religion, no matter where or when, eventually they will rise up and throw off their chains. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that we have any right, particularly any moral right, to hide behind a barricade and expect to live in peaceful and stable surroundings while people in, for example, Timor- the example that I have used throughout tonight- are being <span class="highlight">oppressed</span>, slaughtered, murdered, raped and deprived of everything they have owned by a more powerful and aggressive neighbour apparently just because it is in our interests, as seen by a lot of people high up in this country, not to ruffle Indonesia’s hair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I suggest that in the totality of the matter there is not a great deal of difference between the organisation under which the Soviet people have been <span class="highlight">oppressed</span> over the years and an organisation such as ASIO which, during the period about which I have spoken, has been allowed free reign and which, as I said earlier, may well have destroyed the lives and opportunities of many decent, honest citizens in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
